..........................................
‘........................Uryu...
 .........Maria, ...answer me......’
"..........................."
‘.........Uryu...
 ......So I really am...
...a stuffed animal...?
 ......I\'m made of cloth and cotton,
 ......so there\'s no way I can...
talk......?
 ......Is that why...
...I can\'t talk to you.........?’
Sakutaro looked up at Maria sadly.
Maria\'s face was covered with tears, and she looked as though she had even lost the emotion of sadness......
"............Uu.
 ......I can hear you, Sakutaro.
 ......You aren\'t a stuffed animal made of cloth and cotton.
 .........You\'re my...friend.
 ..................Hate Ange.
 ......Uuu{0}u{0}u{0}u{0}u{0}u{0}u{0}uuu......"
‘Uryu... I\'m sorry Maria, I\'m sorry Maria......!
 Uryu......!’
Sakutaro felt regret.
 By freezing her heart, Maria had finally been able to escape from her sadness.
...By speaking up and calling her back, he had caused her to become overwhelmed with sadness again...
Sakutaro tried toddling up to Maria and hugging her, then letting go,
 gazing at her appearance uneasily and trying it again, lost as to how he could bring Maria\'s spirits up.
......He might have looked a little humorous doing that.
As a result, that was able to divert Maria\'s feelings from sadness......
"Sorry.
 .........More crying won\'t help anything."
‘You got in a fight with Ange, but you still have a lot of friends, Maria...
 Not just me.
 .........You have everyone else too.
 Sakusuke and Sakukichi, the animal band, and many, many more......’
Maria looked at the many stuffed animals around her pillow, which were gathered together as though they were having a conference.
‘......They\'re all...worried about you, Maria.
 They\'ve all been discussing and discussing how to cheer you up, you know......?’
"....................................
 ......They won\'t......go away...like Ange...?"
‘They won\'t.
 We\'ll always be together.’
".........Really?
 You\'re all only with me at home.
 Can\'t go out together when Mama\'s with us, and can\'t go together to school."
‘We aren\'t allowed to go to school, so you\'ll get in trouble if the teacher finds out.
 But if no one finds out, we can be together at any time.’
"......Sakutaro, you\'re big, so you\'d be found."
‘Then you can take some of the kids that are small enough to walk around with.
 ......For example...what about them?
 If you take the friends in the forest band,
 ......look, they\'re small, so they can hide in your pocket and go to school with you.’
".........There\'s a lot of them in the band.
 Can\'t fit them all in my pockets."
She gathered all of the forest band pieces that were scattered across her bed.
There were about as many of them as pieces in a chess set, so it would probably be impossible to fit them all in her pocket...
‘In that case, you can just take friends that you\'re especially close with.
 ......Why don\'t you take the four rabbits, the ones you\'re closest to in the forest band?’
"......Four could fit in my pocket.
 ......Yeah.
 This way, they won\'t be found."
‘So this way, you won\'t be alone even at school, Maria.
 Those kids will be with you even where I can\'t go.’
"...............Yeah.
 ......Maybe...won\'t be lonely that way.
 ......Maybe I can hold out......until I get home from school..."
‘As long as we aren\'t found by the teacher or Mama, we can be with you at any time.
 So let\'s be together forever, play together forever.
 We definitely won\'t leave you all alone, Maria.
 Uryu!’
Maria\'s expression finally regained a little of its brightness.
......That\'s right.
 Thinking about it, my world didn\'t start out with Ange in it.
Even without Ange, everyone was together and it was fun.
So it\'s weird to suddenly get sad just because Ange\'s gone when she was the last to come in.
...All that\'s happened is that I\'ve returned to the world right before Ange entered it.
{n}......So there\'s nothing to be sad about.
"......Yeah.
 Not lonely.
 Sakutaro and everyone else is with me."
‘Uryuu!
 Loooove you, Maria...!’
"I won\'t let any more {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s come into my world.
 ......Mariage Sorcière is an alliance only between me and {f:5:Beatrice}."
"......Even Beato opposed letting Ange join in the beginning.
 .........It\'s alright this way.
 Ange was still too young."
‘......Until you can be friends with Ange again, I think it\'s okay to forget about her for now.
 Just wait until you\'ve regained your high spirits, and then play with her again.
 Until then, all of us will be by your side.’
".........Thanks.
 ......Sakutaro, ......everyone."
Then, I once again regained my former world.
{n}I regained the world where I wasn\'t lonely, and where I was surrounded by many friends.
As always, I didn\'t have any {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} friends at school, but my magic friends were always with me.
Even during class, I could hear the rabbit band hiding in my pocket talking together and giggling, and they sounded like they were having a lot of fun.
Just listening to that added a lot of color to those lonely school hours.
I made sure that my other friends, too, were always with me, as long as Mama and the teacher wouldn\'t find out.
When Mama told me to go play outside, I would secretly pack Sakutaro and Sakusuke and the rest into my bag, and play together at the library or somewhere.
And when Mama was late coming home and I went shopping for dinner, I always went with them.
The men working at the convenience store were always nice to Sakutaro.
{n}Sometimes they even gave me two extra things for free, one for me and one for Sakutaro.
Whenever Mama found out, I would get in trouble for bringing Sakutaro and the rest outside.
Whenever the teacher found out, I would get in trouble for bringing toys to school.
The toxin must be strong in Mama and the teacher.
 That\'s why Sakutaro and the others just look like normal stuffed animals to them.
After all, the men at the convenience store say hello to Sakutaro.
.........Not all {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s are worthless.
 There are a ton of people who, unlike Ange and Mama and my teacher, can say hello to magic friends like I can......
"Oh, Maria‐chan.
 Welcome.
 Is your mama late coming home tonight too...?"
"Yeah.
 ......But Sakutaro\'s with me, so I\'m not lonely.
 Right, Sakutaro?"
‘Uryuu.
 It\'s not just me today.
 Other friends are also with us.’
"Oh, other friends?
 What kind of friends are with you today?"
"Today, the rabbits from the forest band are also with me.
 ......Look, they\'re in my pocket."
Maria began to line up four ceramic rabbit dolls on the register.
As the owner of the shop looked at them with a smile, he signaled a part‐timer with his chin.
The sign on the other register that said "closed" was taken down, and the part‐timer called out for everyone to move over there.
All of the people in line behind Maria formed a new line over there instead...
"Yes, I see.
 You sure have a lot of friends, Maria‐chan.
 But I hope your mama comes home soon."
"Uu.
 Mama is busy with work again, so she\'s staying at the company.
 She\'s very busy lately.
 ......She hasn\'t even been able to get much time to talk to me on the phone."
"But I\'m not lonely!
 I have Sakutaro and all the rest!
 Right?"
‘Uryuu!!’
"All of the rabbits in the band are with me too.
 Look.
 Kyuu‐kyuu{p:0:♪}"
"Is kyuu‐kyuu the sound a rabbit makes?
 Come to think of it, I\'ve never heard one."
After smiling at Sakutaro, who was poking his head out of her knapsack,
 she played around with the rabbit band on the register, making them frolic around.
Even as he gazed at this heartwarming sight, the shop manager had a slightly pitying look on his face.
......This was apparently a family without a father, and where the mother had to work hard and couldn\'t come home very often.
On top of that, it looked like this girl didn\'t even have any friends.
As he watched this girl play around happily with her dolls and claim that she wasn\'t lonely despite everything,
 he couldn\'t help but feel a kind of compassion.
And actually, this wasn\'t limited to him alone.
 Maria had become very famous in this shopping district...
"Maria‐chan, you should eat some oden every once in a while.
 You won\'t grow if you don\'t eat your eggs and fish paste."
"Uu?
 Can\'t get a cream roll...?"
‘Uryu.
 You need variety or you won\'t get big.
 How about oden for today?’
"Uu.
 ......Okay, I\'ll have oden."
"Yep yep, that\'s the ticket.
 Why don\'t I stick a whole bunch in there.
 Want mustard?"
‘Uryuu.
 I can\'t handle spicy things......’
"Alright, I see.
 Then, you make sure you don\'t let it spill on the way home.
 Best eat it while it\'s hot."
"Uu.
 Thank you."
She had planned on getting some sweet pastries for dinner like usual, but since oden had been recommended to her, she would be having that tonight instead.
Letting someone else determine the menu makes for an unexpected and interesting meal.
......Very often, Maria had to decide on her own what to have for dinner, so it was easy for the menu to get a little one‐sided.
 So it felt fun to look forward to a meal she hadn\'t anticipated...
‘Uryuu!
 Thanks for giving us extra, mister!’
"Send my regards to your other friends at home.
 No nibbling at it on the way home, now.
 Go straight home and eat it there."
"Uu!
 Thanks, mister!!"
Maria held the bag with the oden container high for all to see......
".................................
 .........Huh......?"
‘......Uryu?
 What is it, Maria?’
".........The key isn\'t in my pocket."
Standing in front of the door to her house, Maria searched and patted all over her body.
{n}......The key to the house wasn\'t there.
She always methodically put it in the same pocket.
 So there was no way she had put it in another pocket, but she searched her whole body just in case.
......It really wasn\'t there.
‘Did you drop it when you took your wallet out......?’
"No.
 Definitely felt it when I took my wallet out.
 Also definitely felt it when I checked my pocket on the way home."
"......It was there until partway.
 Didn\'t drop it!
 Uu‐uu‐uu...!"
The late autumn wind had been made bearable by the thought of the heater that was waiting at home,
 but now that Maria had lost her key and had no idea what to do, she was really feeling it.
But no matter how hard she searched, she couldn\'t find her key.
 She turned out all her pockets, and even tried taking off her jacket and hitting it, but to no avail.
......Of course, she also turned the knapsack Sakutaro was in upside down, but no key came out.
".........Uu.
 .........Uu‐uu‐uu!!!"
Something that should have been there...wasn\'t where it was supposed to be.
{n}Why isn\'t the key there, when I didn\'t do anything wrong?
......Why isn\'t it?!
{n}Why?!
 Why...?!!!
Maria stamped on the ground, cold and frustrated and angry...
{n}The bottom of her foot throbbed, but even so, it didn\'t lessen her frustration.
......Before long, bitter tears were pouring down her face.
"......Uu.
 ......Uu!!
 Uuuu!!"
It wasn\'t her fault.
 So it was someone else\'s.
But Maria didn\'t know who that someone was, and could do nothing but continue to let out a moan of anger.
‘......Uryu......
 You must have dropped it partway...
 Let\'s look for it, okay?
 Let\'s go back the way we came and search, okay...?’
"......Uu...
 I was excited to buy oden, ......and I got eggs and stuff for free......
 Can\'t eat it while it\'s hot......
 .........Uuuuu!!!"
‘...Maria......I know it\'s frustrating, but let\'s search, okay...?
 It\'s no one\'s fault... Let\'s search...’
Maria finally lent an ear to Sakutaro\'s words, and began to plod back the way she came.
......The wind was colder than it had been, and felt like it was blowing in through the gaps in her jacket to spite her...
‘Uryu...
 Let\'s watch our feet closely and search, okay...?
 And then let\'s get home quickly, and eat oden while getting warm by the heater, okay?
 I\'m sure it\'ll taste good.’
".........Uu.
 ......Not here.
 ......Uu.
 ......Not here..."
As Sakutaro encouraged her, Maria searched for the key...
But she made it all the way back to the convenience store where she\'d bought the oden.
{n}......She hadn\'t found it.
Just in case, she asked the man at the convenience store whether they had found a dropped key,
 but they hadn\'t found anything.
......One more time, she returned home, paying close attention to the area around her feet.
{n}But still—she didn\'t find it.
She was no longer frustrated enough to stomp her feet.
{n}......But hot tears dripped down her face.
The oden was stone cold.
...Even though the man at the shop had said to eat it while it was hot, she hadn\'t been able to.
......He had given her so much extra stuff for free......
‘......Uryu......
 Don\'t cry......
 ......Mama isn\'t coming back tonight.
 ......Let\'s do our best to search......’
".........Why can\'t I find it...
 ......Uuuu............uuuuuuuu!"
‘Maria, don\'t cry...!
 Let\'s do our best to search...!
 .........Maria......’
Maria was no longer able to hold back her tears.
Sobbing, clutching Sakutaro, and with the oden bag in her hand, she returned once more down the road she had come by.
Perhaps because it was now later at night, and more houses and stores had turned their lights off by now, it was even darker and harder to search than before.
......And, once again without finding the key, she returned to the convenience store.
"Maria‐chan,
 ......you still can\'t find your key...?"
"...Uu...
 ......Key, ......gone..."
"Your mother was away for the night?
 You can\'t get into your house without a key?"
"Uu......
 ......Can\'t get in......"
"Well, that is a pretty pickle...
 Did you try going to the police?
 It might have been handed in."
"...............Mama said not to talk to policemen, even if they start talking to me."
"Hm? Now why on Earth is that?"
"................................."
It was probably because Rosa felt guilty for making such a young girl as Maria watch over the house by herself,
 and because she knew that this was not socially acceptable.
So she had indoctrinated Maria into changing the stores she bought things at so that she didn\'t catch the eyes of adults,
 and saying no more than a greeting to policemen, even if they talked to her.
Maria had obediently done as she was told.
Instead of considering why she had to do that,
 honestly obeying because her mother had told her so was far more important to her.
But the manager of the convenience store probably didn\'t think of it that way.
......Naturally, seeing such a young girl being forced to watch over the house alone,
 and so frequently, would cause anyone to worry......
......And then.
 After making the round trip between her home and the store once more, and arriving at the convenience store for a third time...
...a policeman was there.
"That\'s the girl.
 ......Maria‐chan, did you find your key?"
".........Uu...
 ......Can\'t find it......"
"What\'s your name, little girl?"
"........................"
The policeman asked her name, but Maria didn\'t answer.
"Did your mother tell you not to talk with policemen?
 Hahah.
 Don\'t worry, no need to be scared of me.
 Have you eaten dinner yet, little girl?"
".........Bought it, but can\'t get into the house, so I can\'t eat it."
"What\'s your mother doing?
 Is she not coming home today?
 Is she working?"
"..................Uu."
"Do you know how we can contact your mother\'s work?"
"........................"
Maria hung her head limply.
......She didn\'t understand why the policeman was getting mad at her.
No, he probably wasn\'t getting mad at her, but if this reached her mother\'s ears, she would definitely be in trouble.
Even if she didn\'t understand the reason why she would be in trouble, she at least understood that much.
But the policeman wouldn\'t let Maria go.
{n}And her head was swimming from hunger.
The policeman noticed that, and it was decided that they could talk as they ate in the police box.
......I was taken to the police box.
 I had my oden heated in a microwave oven, and there were even {ruby:shio daifuku:salty rice cakes} and hot tea brought out for me.
I\'d been told not to talk to policemen,
 ......but as I answered questions about Sakutaro, I started to feel like he wasn\'t a bad person, and...
...I wouldn\'t be able to return home anyway, so I didn\'t know what to do, so...
.........I told him Mama\'s work phone number,
 ......which I wasn\'t supposed to tell anyone, and was told to use only in a very, very serious situation.
In the tatami room inside the police box, as I ate the oden that was so hot it felt like it would burn me,
 I watched the policeman making the phone call, and lazily thought, "......aah, I\'m probably going to get in trouble..."
"............Is Mama...going to be mad at me.........?"
‘......Uryu.........’
He must have been listening to the phone ringing for a very long time.
 With the receiver up to his ear, the policeman looked up at the clock and grumbled.
"............Maybe they aren\'t picking up because their business hours are over.
 ......Hmmmmmm.
 ......Ah.
 Hello?
 Hello?
 Is this Auntie Rosa Co., Ltd.?"
"This is the Komatsugawa Police Department police box in front of Senbonzakura Station.
 Is President...umm, Udaikan...no, sorry, President Ushiromiya‐san available?
 ............Yes.
 ......Whaat?
 {i:Vacation}?"
"Yes.
 The president\'s off for three days starting yesterday.
 Umm, perhaps I could be of assistance...?"
"Oh no no no, that\'s quite alright.
 So, do you know where she may be?
 Have you heard how she can be contacted, by any chance?"
"Uhh, ......would you mind waiting for just a moment?
 ...............Hey, anyone know where the president\'s taking her vacation?
 How to get hold of her?"
"Heard she was going for all‐you‐can‐eat crabs in Sapporo with her boyfriend.
 Lucky girl, cold places are great for bringing a couple closer together, don\'t you think?
 Haven\'t heard how to get in touch with them."
"Okie‐dokie.
 ......Uhh, hello.
 I hear she went to Sapporo, but I\'m not sure about how to reach her.
 ......Can I take a message?"
"Hmm, I see... That\'s awkward.
 Well, if you make contact with her again, could you tell her that we called?
 Yes, that\'s right."
......After that, I was taken to the police station, which was bigger than the police box,
 and they said I could spend the night there.
And they asked me all kinds of things about myself.
A lady who called herself the district welfare officer came by and asked about various things.
And she said to me, "You poor thing".
{n}When I heard that, I learned for the first time.
"............Am I.........a poor thing......?"
‘......Uryu......
 That\'s not true... You\'re happy, Maria......’
"...............Uu..."
And......Rosa came back.
Maria was told to go to her room,
 ...but on her way back from the bathroom, she hid by the entrance to the living room and listened in on the exchange.
The person who had come to visit...was the female district welfare officer who had asked Maria various questions the other day.
"Don\'t be so pushy!!
 Maria\'s heart is too innocent and delicate, so if there was an insensitive kid there, she could be hurt!!
 Please stop your unwanted meddling!!"
"But in that case, ma\'am,
 if the child is so delicate, why leave her home all alone?
 Shouldn\'t a mother be there for her child?"
"I am here for her as much as I can be!!
 I have no idea what makes you think I need ordering around...!!"
"Really?
 She is very well known in this area, you know.
 They say that your daughter frequently goes out at night to buy things and eat.
 Everyone was worried and looking out for her."
"How do you know that was my child?!!
 Children are a dime a dozen around town!!
 Don\'t just assume that it\'s my Maria!!"
"Kids sometimes walk around outside at night, don\'t they?!
 How can you prove that all of those are my child?!"
"A girl holding a lion stuffed animal often came around to eat dinner and buy things.
 She was very famous around the shopping district."
"Everyone treated Maria‐chan with care out of concern for her.
 Sometimes, people even escorted her home, thinking the streets might be dangerous at night."
"Y‐you can find lion stuffed animals anywhere!!
 It was none of their business, escorting her home!!
 Are they thinking of kidnapping her or something?!"
"Don\'t fuss over Maria!!
 Maria is my child.
 I am raising her!
 I have absolutely no intention of putting her in some strange institution!!
 Stop your needless meddling!!"
‘U‐......uryu......
 Does that lion stuffed animal...
...mean me......?’
"......It\'s alright.
 I\'m the one who\'s in trouble...
 It has nothing to do with you, Sakutaro......"
Maria hugged Sakutaro, continuing to watch her mother fearfully...
"I, I also wish I could be with Maria every day!"
"But I\'m a single mother, so I have to work!
 I may not look it, but I\'m a president of a company, and I bear the responsibility for my employees\' well‐being!!
 I\'m busy with my work all year round, there\'s no time for me to rest!!"
"{i:Really}?
 But you\'ve been off work for the last three days, haven\'t you?"
"I, I have not been off work!
 I\'ve been staying at my company for several nights working!!
 There\'s a mountain of matters to be taken care of that the other unreliable employees can\'t handle!!"
"Why are you lying like that?
 The people at your company told us that you were taking a three‐day vacation, you know?
 You went to Hokkaido with your boyfriend, right?
 Leaving your daughter by herself for three whole days...!"
"I, I don\'t know anything about any boyfriend I don\'t know anything about Hokkaido!!!
 Why are you coming out with all this nonsense?!
 Why, why?!
 Do you have any proof?!

 What\'s wrong with you, don\'t just start butting in on someone else\'s family matters!!"
"I love Maria, I have my own way of loving her, so just keep your mouth shut!!
 I didn\'t go on a vacation, I was working the whole time, I was working!!"
"I was trying to finish things up at work with all my strength, all my strength because I wanted to see Maria as soon as I could!!
 I stayed at the company working and working and working and working and working, working and working and working and working!!"
"I don\'t know anything I don\'t know anything, I don\'t know anything about Hokkaido, don\'t come in saying all this!!! Uuuaaaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}AAa{0}a{0}aAA{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}AAHHH!!!
 Please, just go!!
 Just go!!!!!
 What is wrong with you?!?!
 Just go!!
 JUST GO{-}O{-}O{-}O{-}O{-}O{-}O{-}OOO!!!"
Rosa raged, her hair flying wildly.
She stood up with such force that her teacup fell over,
 and far louder than that noise was the sound of her beating the table with both hands.
When faced with this rage that could accurately be described as wide‐eyed derangement,
 the female welfare officer couldn\'t help but be taken aback.
......And the same went for Maria, who was secretly watching this from the hallway.
She had seen her mother enraged several times before.
{n}But she had never seen her go this berserk with anger.
Seeing this, Maria was sure.
{n}......This was no longer her mother.
It was some other evil being that was possessing her mother\'s body...
And then, the evil being discovered her.
{n}Maria learned that she was being reflected in the evil being\'s eyes.
Her mind went blank, and she felt as though her field of vision was racing off into the distance......
After fiercely closing in on Maria, Rosa mercilessly bore down on her small shoulders,
 ......and dropped her gaze onto the stuffed animal Maria was holding: Sakutaro.
".........Maria.
 Even though I told you so many times not to bring that outside,
 ......you brought it with you, didn\'t you?"
‘U‐......uryu.........
 I‐it\'s not Maria\'s fault......
 I said I\'d come with her......’
"Th‐that\'s not true......!
 I brought Sakutaro on my own because I was lonely...!
 So Mama, it\'s not Sakutaro\'s fault...!!"
‘Uryu...... Maria.........’
"It\'s not Sakutaro\'s fault!!
 It\'s not Sakutaro\'s fault!!"
The brunt of Rosa\'s anger was aimed, not at Maria, but at the lion stuffed animal Maria was holding.
......A girl came shopping in the middle of the night, always clutching a lion stuffed animal.
Because of that, she had become well known in the shopping district...
"I,
 ......I,
 ...I told you not to take stuffed animals with yo{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}ouuu!!!
 Why—!!
 Can\'t you—!!
 Listen to what Mama says!!"
"Why?!
 Why, why?!
 Why can\'t you follow Mama\'s ru{-}u{-}u{-}u{-}u{-}u{-}ules!!"
With every single word, she stamped her heel and banged furiously on the wall.
......Admittedly, she wasn\'t making direct contact with Maria.
However, the violence of that harsh sound certainly beat against her.
"M‐Ma\'am...... Stop that......!!"
"Let go!!
 I said let go, damn iiiiiiiiiiiit!!"
The welfare officer had come back to her senses and put Rosa in a full nelson.
But the instant Rosa was touched, she went wild, furiously throwing the welfare officer off.
......She hit the table and fell to the ground.
 A teacup on the table smashed on the floor, making a violent sound...
‘M‐......Maria didn\'t do anything wrong......!
 It\'s my fault!
 So don\'t scold Maria......!!’
"I\'m the one who brought Sakutaro...!!
 It\'s not Sakutaro\'s fault!!
 It\'s not Sakutaro\'s fault!!
 So don\'t look at Sakutaro with those scary eyes!!
 Don\'t look at hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiim!!"
‘Don\'t scold Maria...!
 Don\'t scold Maria...!!
 Uryuuu!!!’
"........................Wh‐.........what in the...
 Just what do you think you\'re doing?"
"Did you...also play with dolls like that......outside?
 Did you do it in front of the people at the store......?"
"........................
 Then OF COURSE they remembered yoooooooou,
 THINK a little, you idiot!! Why are you such a DUMBAA{-}A{-}A{-}A{-}A{-}A{-}A{-}A{-}AAASSS!!!"
"Answer me honestly.
 When you went out shopping, you always walked around with that stuffed animal without telling Mama, right?"
‘.........U‐......uryu.........’
"Stop using that weird stuffed animal talk!!!
 Speak with your own words, not a stuffed animal\'s!!!"
"S‐Sakutaro isn\'t a stuffed animal!!
 He\'s my friend!!
 Don\'t call him a stuffed animal......
 Dooo{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}oon\'t!!"
"Yes, yes, fine, Sakutarou, it was called Sakutarou!
 You took that Sakutarou doll with you all the time when you went shopping, without telling Mama, right?"
"Y‐......yeah..............."
Maria admitted it honestly.
If she hadn\'t admitted it, then Sakutaro would have said something to take the blame,
 so by admitting it right away, she was protecting her small friend.
"Only Sakutarou?
 Any others?
 ......You haven\'t...been bringing weird things to school too, have you...?"
"......M‐Ma\'am!!
 This is not your daughter\'s fault!
 Stop this interrogation at once!"
"You bite your tongue!!!
 I am talking with my daughter!!!
 ......Alright, Maria, look at Mama when you talk.
 What\'s the answer to Mama\'s question?"
"U‐......uu......
 ......Not just Sakutaro.
 ......All the rabbits too......"
".........Do you have them with you now......?"
"Uu........."
Maria fished around in her pocket,
 ......and pulled out those four ceramic rabbits with her tiny hand...
The rabbits were her precious friends, who could go to school with her in Sakutaro\'s place.
But when Rosa saw that, she shook her head slightly as though dizzy...
In Maria\'s communication booklet, a note had been written that Maria was apparently bringing toys to school and playing with them,
 and it requested Rosa to give her home instruction to try to prevent this.
But Rosa had dismissed the teacher\'s comment as faultfinding, and on the contrary, had phoned the school to make a complaint of her own.
...Saying that there was no way her child would bring toys to school.
For nearly an hour, she had shouted at the vice principal to stop making false accusations about her daughter.
......To a certain degree, the school grasped that Maria was a pitiful girl.
They knew that the small toys she brought in were her only friends.
......So they had done their best to overlook it.
But when the other students caught sight of them,
 some of the boys started complaining that only she was allowed to bring toys, and the school had racked their brains on how to cope with this......
They had tried to gently send a warning by way of the mother,
 but after Rosa\'s overreaction, even Maria\'s teacher had decided to overlook it.
.........But now Rosa knew.
She had been the one who was wrong, ...and her daughter really had been bringing toys into school.
.........And the school...
had seen the sorry sight of her bringing toys into school and playing with them as her only friends.
To Rosa, who knew her daughter was a little different from normal children,
 having this peculiar side of her daughter exposed and found fault with was more unbearable than anything.
.........So she howled.
 She raged.
The welfare officer tried to cut between Rosa and Maria again,
 but she only met with Rosa\'s wrath again.
Rosa once again threw the woman off with a face like a demon,
 and when even that failed to curb her anger, she stomped on the ground over and over again so forcefully that it seemed she might break through the floor.
Then, after seeming to come back to her senses for just a second,
 .........she suddenly froze her rough breathing, and asked Maria.
"........................
 ......Maria.
 Those rabbits in the band, are they your close friends?"
"U‐.........uu........."
"I see.
 I\'m glad you have a full four friends."
As she said that, Rosa took one of the rabbits from Maria\'s hand.
Then, she shoved it in front of Maria\'s eyes so she could see it very well.
......It was a cute little doll, like a chess piece, of a rabbit holding a trumpet.
She slowly lifted it into the air.
......Of course, Maria\'s and Sakutaro\'s eyes also followed it......
And then, with a speed that the eye couldn\'t follow, she hurled it against the wall.
"Eek—!!!!"
‘...............!!!’
She had half‐imagined that this worst possible thing might happen.
{n}So she instantly realized what had been done.
......So Maria let out a short, despairing scream...
It was in pieces.
It had been small and sturdy, but not enough to accept her mother\'s fierce rage.
".........Because you didn\'t listen to what Mama told you, one of them broke.
 From now on, every time you disobey something Mama says, I\'ll break another one.
 ......Remember that!!!"
"You......you call yourself a mother after doing something like that?!!
 You think you can do something like that without hurting your daughter?!"
"Hurt {i:Maria}?!
 I\'m hurting too, you know?!
 Who\'s gonna take responsibility for {i:my} wounds?!
 Weeeell?!
 WHOOOOOOOO!!!
 I told you to bite your tongue!!!!!"
"S‐stop it, Mama......!
 It\'s my fault...!
 Don\'t get mad at this lady......!"
‘It isn\'t Maria\'s fault... It\'s mine......!
 Don\'t get mad at Maria...!
 Uryu, uryu‐uryu‐uryu, uryuuu!’
"I, .........I told you to stop playing make‐believe with that stuffed animaaaaaaaal!!
 In the first place, it\'s disturbing, a stuffed animal is your friend? Just how old are you this year?!
 How old?!
 Weeelll?!"
"This is just a gross, crappy stuffed animal made of cloth and cotton!!
 Is this the only kind of friend you have?!
 If you have enough time on your hands to play make‐believe friends with this monstrous stuffed animal, go out and make some real human friends instead!!"
"Why is it that time goes on and on and you still can\'t make any friends?!!
 That\'s why your class always treats you like a weirdo and makes fun of you!!
 Cut it out, give it a rest, get ahold of yourself already!!
 Grow up from this stuffed‐animal play!!"
‘Uryu......
uryu.........’
"I said...stop playing make‐believe...with that stuffed animaaaaaaaal!!"
"Aaah!!
 Mama, Mama!!
 Give him back!
 Give Sakutaro baaaaaaaaaaack!!"
‘Uryuu!!
 Uryuuu!
 Uryu‐uryuu!’
Mama grabbed hold of Sakutaro\'s head, and snatched him from me...
{n}Then.........she smashed him against the wall, over and over.
‘Uryuu!!
 It hurts, it hurts, ow‐ow‐ow‐ow...!!’
"Fucking STOP!!
 Fucking STOP playing make‐believe with this stuffed animal!!!!!
 It\'s because of this stuffed animal!!"
"That\'s why you can never make any friends!
 That\'s why you\'re the only one in your class who sticks out like a sore thumb, and gets treated like a weird kid!!
 I should never have given you a stuffed animal like this!!
 I should never have given you this disgusting stuffed animal!!"
"Stop iiiiiiiiiiiit!!"
"Give Sakutaro back, give Sakutaro back!!
 WaaaA{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}A{0}a{0}a{0}AahHH!!
 Sakutaro is my friend!!
 My best friend!!
 I don\'t need anything else if I just have Sakutaro!
 So give him back!!
 Give him baaaaaaaack!!"
......For some reason, my frantic request just added oil to the fire of Mama\'s anger......
As I pulled on Sakutaro trying to take him back, Mama pushed my arm aside,
 and in a bizarre way, she stuck her fingernails on both hands deep into Sakutaro, twisting him......
The red scarf, which I had carefully wrapped for him every day, came undone and fell to the floor...
......Sakutarou, who had been so, so precious to me......
He was crumpled, twisted, torn at with fingernails so much......
He was twisted in pain...
his face grimacing...
so sadly.........
Then Mama\'s fingernails...
...found a stitch on the neck
......and tore it...
......With the fingernails of both hands
......she tore him apart............
In that instant,
 .........Sakutaro\'s yellow cloth,
 .........and the cotton inside, ...burst apart......
It looked almost like moist cotton candy......
‘......U‐...............ryu.....................’
"...kutaro............?"
‘......Ma......ria.........’
".........Sakutaro............"
‘U......ryu......{m:-5:―――}’
"...............kutaro............"
‘{m:-5:―}―...... . . .   .         ’
".........ta...ro........."
‘’
...
.........The crumpled yellow cloth and the cotton candy that was flowing out were thrust right in front of my eyes.
Then, ......through Mama\'s face, the evil being...stated it clearly.
"{i:Sakutarou is dead}."

"{f:5:Maria}...... ......{f:5:Maria}.........
 ...Do not cry......"
"{f:5:Beatrice}, {f:5:Beatrice}...!!
 Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!!
 Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!!"
"Sakutarou was a good friend...
 As long as you do not forget that, he will always be with you...
 So do not cry..."
"Bring him back to life!!
 You can use a lot of magic, Beato!!
 You can bring Sakutaro back to life as well, right?!"
"............A‐about that......
 ...Of course, if Sakutarou had been my furniture, it would be easy.
 However, Sakutarou is your furniture.
 ......That makes it difficult for me."
"Difficult but not impossible, right?!
 Bring him back to life!!
 Bring him back to life with the Endless Magiiiiiic!"
".........Hmm...
 ......To tell the truth...
 Sakutarou\'s vessel was a stuffed animal Rosa made herself, correct...?
 That Rosa has denied Sakutarou.
 ......A life that is not permitted by its own mother cannot exist..."
{f:5:Beatrice}\'s words were feeble.
...Because she knew that, no matter what the excuse,
 it wouldn\'t be enough to calm Maria and make her accept it.
But she had to communicate the painful truth to her disciple and close friend.
.........She had to tell her the fact...
...that even with all of her own magic, even she could not revive Sakutarou.
"As long as you continue to strongly believe in Sakutarou\'s existence, his soul will not disappear......
 So, {f:5:Maria}, ...please, do not be sad...
 Even now, look, ...you must believe that Sakutarou is smiling right over there......"
"No!!!
 No
 no
 no!!
 You have to bring Sakutaro back to life!!
 No no no!
 WaaA{0}AAa{0}a{0}a{0}aAAa{0}a{0}aAa{0}aAahhhh!!"
"Give up...!!
 There is no magic to revive Sakutarou...!
 You must strongly believe that even in spite of that, Sakutarou will continue to exist as your close friend...!!
 That power will become magic...!"
"That\'s not magic, that\'s not magic!!
 You have to bring Sakutaro back to life...!!"
"Can\'t you do it because Mama made him herself?
 Why did Mama make Sakutaro?
 Wasn\'t it to give him to me as a present?
 Wasn\'t it to make him my friend?"
"But why...did Mama make him herself...and break him herself?
 Why did Mama create him herself, and try to break him herself?
 Don\'t get it, don\'t get it!!"
"Hate Mama, hate Mama...!!
 Can\'t stand it, can\'t stand it, it\'s too much, it\'s too much...!!
 Want to twist Mama up like she did to Sakutaro...!
 Want to stick my fingernails in and tear her, turn her into cloth and cotton!!"
"Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!!
 Can\'t stand it, I can\'t stand it, {f:5:Beatriceeee}!!
 Waa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aahhh, Sakutaroooooooo!!!!"
From the darkness behind Maria\'s back, two massive jet‐black arms crept out,
 coiling around Maria as she sobbed in anger.
Then massive fingernails stuck into Maria\'s chest and stomach......
Maria could not see them.
{n}......But Beato could.
Anger and sadness without any place to go will tear you apart.
......Beato knew that.
 She could see that.
Yes.
 ......In the end, those massive arms were Maria\'s own.
Those fingernails slowly started to dig into her chest and stomach......
......With their immense size and strength,
 those arms would probably tear Maria into bits easily......
But Maria herself couldn\'t notice.
Drowning in a sea of her own tears, ......she couldn\'t notice that her own arms were trying to tear apart her own chest......
"Can\'t stand it, can\'t stand it...!!!
 If Sakutaro can\'t be brought back to life no matter what, ......I want revenge!!
 Want to make the same thing happen to Mama!!
 Want to make her suffer the same thing as Sakutaro...!"
"{f:5:Beatrice}!!
 Teach me magic for that!!
 Teach me magic to get back at Mama...!!"
".................................
 ......Are those your true feelings?"
"I\'ll kill Mama!!
 I\'ll kill her!!
 No, that\'s not Mama!
 It\'s the bad witch possessing Mama!
 I\'ll kill the witch Mama!!
 Uuu{0}u{0}u{0}u{0}u{0}u{0}u{0}u{0}u{0}u{0}u{0}u{0}u{0}u{0}u{0}uuu!!"
"........................
 ......Very well.
 I shall give you that power.
 ......If you, beautiful of heart, shall otherwise be torn asunder by your own hand...
...then I find your heartless mother, who brought such suffering upon you, considerably more deserving of such a fate."
"...............I shall teach you.
 ......Of the abyss in the world of witches, of the depths where no light reaches......"
"Uuuuuuuu, Sakutaro, Sakutaro...!!
 I hate everyone, I hate them, I HATE THEM!!
 Hate Mama, hate Ange!!
 Hate everyone, EVERYONE!!
 Uuuuuuwaa{0}a{0}aaAAA{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}AAAAHHH......!!"
