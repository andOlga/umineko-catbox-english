Knock‐knock‐knock‐knock!!!
The sudden sound of someone banging fiercely on the door brought Natsuhi to her senses.
She had probably nodded off in the study while planning how they would overcome the next day.
But...what could it be...?
 At a time like this...
More importantly, the knock itself was strange.
If someone had wanted to contact her, they could have just used the internal phone line.
She had told them that she would be here.
Realizing that something strange was going on,
 Natsuhi shook her head one more time, completely throwing off her drowsiness.
"Father, Father...!!
 It\'s Eva.
 I have something urgent and vital to talk to you about!"
It was Eva\'s voice.
......What is this?
I thought I told them to lock the doors and windows of the mansion tightly after everyone left for the guesthouse.
So why is Eva here...?!
Natsuhi ran up to the door, responded with a small knock, and spoke through the door in a quiet voice.
".........What do you want? Keep your voice down."
"Natsuhi nee‐san...?!
 Why are you in Father\'s study at this hour?!"
"......I told you to be quiet!
 Have you forgotten that the head treasures peace and silence above all else...?!"
"Now\'s not the time to be saying that!!
 Stop harping on that and open up quickly!!
 Bring Father out!!"
"The head just went to sleep!
 I don\'t know what business you have, but I will listen to it tomorrow!"
"I don\'t have any business with you!!
 Just open up right now!!"
Sometimes, all one\'s schemes and assumptions can fall apart due to the most direct, simple, and emotional of strategies.
This is bad...
If I open the door, Eva will probably throw herself forwards and rush into the study.
Now, I can\'t even open this door...!
At that moment, the phone suddenly rang.
I‐it\'s alright.
 Both of the keys to the study are here.
No one can open this door...!
Natsuhi inched away from the door and grabbed the receiver...
"H‐...hello!!
 It\'s Natsuhi!"
"It\'s me...
 Things are bad.
 I want you to come down to the parlor, quickly."
It was from Krauss.
 His tone was strained.
......What in the world happened...?!
"It seems that Battler‐kun and the guest called Erika...
......solved the witch\'s epitaph and found the gold."
"Huh? ........................
 ...Is, ...is that true?!"
"Rudolf and the rest have forced their way in.
 They\'re saying that Battler‐kun is going to show us all the way to the location of the hidden gold..."
"Right now, Eva‐san is just outside the door, yelling at me to open it...!
 If I open it now, she might push her way into the study...!!"
"...I, I understand.
 I will be there soon.
 Don\'t worry about Eva.
 Just stay there and don\'t do anything...!
 I\'ll give you a signal once I\'ve gotten Eva away from the door, so leave as soon as you hear that.
 Be ready...!"
Right after that, Krauss came up the staircase, accompanied by Genji.
A heated debate started between him and Eva. "Open up!" "No, calm down."
In the middle of that, there was a small knock as a signal.
......Krauss had skillfully pushed Eva away from the door and distracted her.
During that gap, Natsuhi slipped out of the study and quickly shut the door...
Eva noticed this, and her face twisted in disappointment,
 but the heavy sound of the auto‐lock had already rung out, and the door had been sealed.
"The gold of the epitaph has been found!!
 It\'s only natural that we should inform Father...!!
 Or else what?
 Is there some reason you can\'t tell Father about this?!"
"We have strict orders from Father not to wake him after he goes to bed under any circumstances.
 Following those orders is the duty of the head\'s representative.
 Isn\'t that right, Genji‐san?"
"............Yes.
 The Master\'s sleep must not be disturbed, no matter the circumstances."
"There\'s a time and place for everything, isn\'t there...?!!
 I mean, the epitaph was solved!!
 Father has a right to know straight away!"
"Of course, the two of us will report on everything to the head tomorrow.
 That\'s our duty as the head\'s representatives."
"I don\'t care about that!!
 Just open this door!!
 Let me see Father!!
 Father, Father, can you hear me?
 It\'s Eva!!
 Please open up!!"
"Owowow, let go of me...!!
 Th‐that hurts...!!"
"We will bring this to his attention......!
 Now stop knocking on the door so loudly......!!"
"Ouch, owowowowow...!!
 Let go, let go of me!!"
"Krauss‐sama, Eva‐sama.
 You have been told that the Master is sleeping.
 Please refrain from disturbing him any further...!"
When Genji spoke firmly, the two finally ceased their scuffle.
It seemed that Genji, the one who had spoken for Kinzo since they were very young, still possessed an air of dignity strong enough to handle both Krauss and Eva...
Eva put her argument aside for the time being.
She could worry about that after seeing the gold with her own eyes.
After all, not even she had yet seen it for herself.
Natsuhi and the others had managed to deal with this crisis somehow.
......However, the demons\' move which would sneer upon their efforts was already in motion...
"Battler.........solved the riddle of the epitaph, you say......?!"
"Mm.
 ......Though he had a lot of help from that Erika girl, Battler was the one who reached the answer.
 Erika has proclaimed that she will renounce her rights to the Golden Land.
 ......Therefore, Battler is the one who reached the Golden Land."
".........Fate can be truly interesting.
 To think that Battler‐sama should be the one to reach that place..."
"What will you do, Beato?
 ......You made a promise to stop the ritual if anyone solved the epitaph\'s riddle."
"Mm.
 ...That was the agreement."
".........That is the agreement.
 Yes."
"Apparently, Battler‐sama does not intend to become the master of the Golden Land.
 ......It now seems that no one will become our master."
"That is also fate.
 It has been several decades since we first manifested in the Human world through our bond with Lord GOLDSMITH.
 ......It was all very fun."
".........Come on, Lia, you sound like an old lady.
 ......So, what\'re we going to do?
 According to Riiche and GOLDSMITH\'s rules, now that Battler\'s solved the epitaph and decided not to become our master,
 we\'ve been relieved from duty, right?"
"That\'s true.
 ......I have no regrets at all.
 I\'ve been prepared to be kicked down into Cocytus all this time."
"Wait.
 We can\'t let that happen.
 ......You might not have any regrets, but I still serve Natsuhi.
 To let ourselves be relieved from duty just because Battler solved the epitaph would be quite irresponsible.
 ......Witches aren\'t allowed to break contracts, but they also must not fail to show gratitude."
"......True.
 We should serve her until the family conference ends."
"In that case, you won\'t be relieved from duty for a while either, Lord GOLDSMITH.
 ......Perhaps you should wait until you\'ve overcome this family conference safely, said goodbye to Natsuhi‐sama at the very least,
 ......and if possible, rewarded her for all her efforts."
"...............Hmm.
 ......She has done well supporting my foolish son."
"Aren\'t you a fallen angel with one of its wings plucked off?
 Just leave the other wing as a parting gift and go."
"......Hmm.
 ......That is also fitting.
 Natsuhi might be worthy to bear my wing.
 ...However, .........we are approaching the critical moment.
 ......Your reward is waiting for you.
 Try and overcome this test safely, ......Natsuhi..."
The mountain of gold left everyone speechless.
Regardless of how strongly they had believed in its existence,
 ......no one could look at this much real gold and not be shocked...
"............To think that a place like this existed........."
"I can\'t believe it......
 ......That Dad........."
Everyone was stunned by the gold.
The first one to break the silence and jump around in ecstasy was Hideyoshi.
Letting out an excited laugh, he clung to the wall of gold,
 and he felt the cold, hard touch of it all over his cheek.
"W‐wahahahahahahahahahahahaha...!!
 Th‐this is incredible!
 It\'s the real thing!!"
"......Ha......hahahahahahaha!!
 Damn you, old man, stockpiling all this gold in a crazy place like this!!"
"If we have all this...
...there\'s...
nothing to be afraid of anymore...
 Anything life throws at us,
 ......we can overcome......!
 Rosaaa......!!"
"Nee‐san...... Nee‐san......
 We\'ll be able to find happiness with this, right......?"
Eva and Rosa started walking towards each other at the same time and hugged each other as they broke down crying...
Ecstasy and shock...wonder and sighs.
After stepping forward in front of the pile of gold that caused these mixed emotions,
 ......Erika spoke as though she were an announcer in some show.
".........If money is everything in this world, then this gold is the embodiment of happiness.
 ......Congratulations, everyone.
 I pray with all my heart that this discovery enriches your lives."
"I take my hat off to you......
 ......To think that you would solve the epitaph within a single day of coming to this island."
".........If it wasn\'t solvable in a single day, then it wouldn\'t have been solvable no matter how many days I spent on it.
 After all, it doesn\'t take more than an instant for your little gray cells to give you a flash of intuition.
 ......Also, I wouldn\'t have been able to solve this riddle on my own.
 I ask that you praise Battler‐san\'s achievement as well, everyone."
"................................."
"......I renounce any rights to this discovery.
 My reasoning was proven correct, and that alone is enough to satisfy me.
 Therefore, I want to give Battler‐san the full credit for discovering the gold."
"......I may be here, but please continue your discussion as though I am not.
 Battler‐san called all of the adults here, making sure that none of his cousins would notice.
 That can only mean one thing.
 ......He must wish for you all to conduct the true family conference."
"......Erika.
 Quit trying to run the show."
"Oh, how rude of me.
 ............In that case, I\'ll step down as the facilitator of these proceedings.
 So, who will take my place?"
Shrugging, Erika looked around at everyone.
......After a short period of silence, Eva made the first move.
"I assume none of us have forgotten......the deal we made earlier today."
"Yeah.
 We divide it between the four of us, 2.5 billion each.
 And then the successor to the head gets another 10 billion."
".........W‐wait just a moment!
 Who decided that the one who discovers the gold becomes the successor?!"
"Hold your horses, you\'re not gettin\' away with that, Natsuhi‐san...!!
 That\'s been the basis of all our talkin\' this whole time!
 Sayin\' that now is shameful, don\'t ya think?!"
"...That\'s right.
 ......Weren\'t you the one worrying about how if one of the servants solved the riddle, they might consider themselves the successor to the head...?"
"But nowhere is it explicitly written that that\'s the truth!"
"You miserable coward!!!
 That was the way every single one of us interpreted it!!"
"She\'s right, Aniki!
 Are you really going to do a 180 on that now?!"
"Though it was never written down, I believe it was most definitely common understanding between us.
 I don\'t see how you can say it\'s completely irrelevant."
"You can\'t just interpret the head\'s epitaph however you like!!
 Where is it written that the one who finds the gold becomes the successor?!
 The epitaph was decided upon by the head.
 You have no right to decide these things for yourselves!!"
".........Calm down, Natsuhi."
"How can I possibly calm down?!
 I certainly find it very impressive that Battler‐kun solved the epitaph!
 I do think it would be fair for him to receive some kind of a reward.
 However, saying that reward should be half of everything here is clearly over the line,
 and the argument that the discoverer automatically becomes the successor is one that I absolutely will not permit to go unchallenged...!!"
"Th‐that\'s low, Natsuhi nee‐san...!
 This is completely different from what you were saying earlier today...!"
"I agree!
 It may not have been written down, but the fact that the guy who solves the epitaph becomes the successor has always been our greatest unwritten assumption...!
 It\'s not exactly fair to start complaining about that at the last second, is it?!
 Yeah, not fair at all!!"
"At any rate!!
 This gold belongs to Father!!
 We are not to decide how it will be split up without Father\'s permission!!"
"No way!!
 That\'s real low, Natsuhi‐san!
 We were talkin\' about this on and on earlier!
 Are you sayin\' that whole conversation today was a bunch of bull?!
 That\'s just not right!!"
"Why don\'t we just vote on it?!!
 Battler‐kun, the one who found the gold, is the successor to the head!
 My husband and I have no objections!!
 What about you, Rudolf and Kyrie‐san?
 Rosa?!"
"No objections here. Nice going, Battler!!"
"I have no objections either.
 Battler‐kun is the true successor, chosen by the epitaph.
 If you aren\'t satisfied, then why don\'t we just ask Father directly...?!"
"That\'s right.
 Like you just said, Natsuhi nee‐san, Father is the one who wrote the riddle of the epitaph.
 And he\'s also the proper owner of this gold.
 In that case, we should raise the matter with him, wouldn\'t you say?
 What kind of treatment should Battler‐kun receive as the person who discovered the gold?
 I believe Father is the only one with the right to determine that...!"
"B‐...but......!!"
"......I told you to calm down........."
"Rosa and Kyrie‐san are right.
 Let\'s ask Father!!
 It\'s time for you two to step aside!!"
"Darn right!!
 Bring Father down to us!!
 We won\'t get anywhere with just you two!
 Let\'s get the real family conference started!!
 You think this looks like somethin\' you can put off because he\'s tired?!
 We don\'t do this properly, an\' we\'ll have a massive problem on our hands...!"
"Hey, ya listenin\' to me?!!
 I\'m sayin\' we\'re through with you two!!
 Get off your asses and bring Father down right noooooow!!!"
"...............Are family conferences always like this?"
"......How the hell\'d I know?"
"They\'re probably always feeling like this on the inside.
 .........Heheheheh.
 Looks like they won\'t be able to get this figured out right now without Kinzo‐san."
"......To think he\'s still being called out to settle his children\'s fights even though he\'s been told he only has a short while to live.
 ......I wonder how he feels right about now.
 ......*giggle*.
 Imagining that...no, deducing that will be a treat."
The parents ignored Battler and Erika and kept yelling at each other, on and on...
Even though Battler had more or less imagined that this sort of thing happened behind the scenes, this was the first time he had seen it.
He had suspected it since six years ago,
 and he\'d been able to get a pretty good idea of what this was like by the darkening expressions on his parents\' faces when this time of year drew near...
However, this argument his relatives were having before his very eyes...
...was much more...
...ugly than he had imagined...
He was very glad that he\'d called the adults out here without letting the cousins catch wind of anything......
Perhaps because everyone was tired out from this seemingly endless argument, they took a short break.
It was decided that this family conference inside the Golden Land should be moved over to the mansion...
This place may have been gorgeous, like a VIP room, but there was no ventilation, and it was a little cold.
It wasn\'t well suited for a long conversation.
They thought of the possibility that someone might carry the gold away while their backs were turned,
 but it wasn\'t as if anyone could manage much with just human hands and a small amount of time when they had ten tons of gold to deal with.
In fact, it even seemed as though having this mountain of gold in the background was robbing them of the ability to make sound decisions.
So they agreed to return to the mansion, in part so that they could regain their composure and continue the conference more ruthlessly......
"......Well then, I will retire for the night.
 ......I imagine I would just get in the way if I remained any longer."
"Yeah, sorry about this.
 Did we bother you too much?"
"Please let us show our gratitude again tomorrow.
 Sorry for letting you see such an embarrassing side of us."
"I know you said you were turning it down,
 but we\'ll still prepare a fitting share, out of gratitude, for you as one of the first to discover the gold.
 Right, Nii‐san?"
"......Mm.
 We know what you\'re capable of.
 I think you can grasp our current circumstances."
20 billion yen in gold wasn\'t something they wanted out in the open.
They didn\'t want an outsider like Erika telling people about it.
Of course, Erika had already "deduced" that much.
She wore an unpleasant smile on her face, as though she understood all too well...
"......It\'s quite unnecessary for you to worry about me.
 I have no intention of telling anyone about this, of course.
 ......And even if I did, no one would believe me without proof."
".........I had the pleasure of witnessing something very interesting tonight.
 It was truly a feast for the eyes, so let me assure you that I\'m more than satisfied."
"Heheh, I see.
 Yes, it\'s not every day you get to see ten tons of gold."
......Getting to see the gold was the feast for the eyes?
 Of course not.
From Erika\'s dark nature, it was easy to guess what she was so happy about seeing.
I thought about telling her to get the hell out of here already, but I wanted out myself...
I tried to head back to the guesthouse along with Erika.
However, Kyrie‐san grabbed my shoulder.
"Not you as well, Battler‐kun.
 You come with us, please."
"Darn right.
 You\'re a real successor to the head now!
 You\'ve gotta go see Father and make it all official...!"
"Father is the only one who gets to decide that!!
 Don\'t make things up on your own!"
"......Battler.
 I know it\'s a pain, but you\'re gonna have to stick around with us for a little while longer.
 Don\'t say a word.
 Just stay quiet and keep your head down.
 Got it?"
"............Just do whatever you want."
It would have been easy to say that I had no interest in being successor to the head.
......But I was sure that would only add more oil to the fire.
Even if I hadn\'t been ordered to keep quiet, I was certain that staying shut up like a clam was the wisest thing to do...
In that case, would it really be so bad if they just let me go back to the guesthouse...?
Dad put his arm firmly around my shoulder, and I told him to quit crowding me.
But it didn\'t make any difference...
".........We solved the epitaph.
 Just like you wanted."
"................................."
"When you were the Game Master, we\'d always get those letters.
 ......‘Try and solve the epitaph.
 If you don\'t, I\'ll kill you all’."
"................................."
.........Why did she want to make us solve the riddle of the epitaph?
By solving it, we found a mountain of gold.
Yippee for us.
And what about Beato?
......Does she gain anything......by having us find the gold?
Or does she lose something...?
"...As far as chessboard thinking tells us, ......people don\'t make moves which cause them to lose something.
 That means you must have something to gain by having us solve the epitaph..."
"No.
 
This child has nothing to gain from having someone solve the epitaph."
"............Are you sure that\'s alright?
 Using the red truth like that without her permission."
"......It is what she would want."
VIRGILIA, who had suddenly appeared there, gave me an immediate answer to my question with the red truth...
"In the past, I sometimes guessed that the reason Beato was trying to make us solve the epitaph...
was that she wanted to make us find the gold\'s hiding place for her so that she could snatch it away.
 .........Is that wrong too?"
"Yes.
 ......In the first place,
 
the gold of the Golden Land belongs to her from the start.
 
She has absolutely no need to make anyone find it for her or to snatch it away herself."
Of course.
 ......Beato is BEATRICE the Golden.
She\'s the master of the Golden Land and the Ushiromiya family alchemist.
...That makes total sense.
However, if that\'s true, that makes me even more confused.
......Even if someone exposes the answer to the epitaph\'s riddle, Beato gains nothing.
No, to the contrary, she might get her own gold stolen away.
"In that case, I\'m understanding this less and less.
 .........I understand the epitaph murders.
 It could be revenge against the Ushiromiya family, or else a ritual to revive her powers as a witch.
 ...She\'s probably got some reason or goal of her own for it."
"................................."
"But what\'s the point of her telling us to solve the epitaph?
 Whether we solve it or not, she gains nothing.
 ......In other words, the whole issue of whether the epitaph is solved or not is immaterial in Beato\'s eyes."
"......You could say that.
 
Whether the epitaph\'s riddle is solved or not, she has nothing at all to gain from it."
"It doesn\'t matter whether it\'s solved or not.
 ......Doesn\'t that mean that the epitaph\'s riddle itself has no value to Beato...?"
"..................
 ......I suppose.
 The epitaph\'s riddle doesn\'t have any meaning for her.
 So even if you take the extreme position that it\'s immaterial and has no value, it may not be possible to argue against your claim..."
"................................."
Beato......
......Why are you making us solve the riddle of the epitaph...?
If we liken the witch you are to a pair of scales, the epitaph murders lie on one plate...
And the riddle of the epitaph lies on the other plate.
Because she\'s saying that she\'ll stop the epitaph murders if the epitaph is solved.
......In other words, the epitaph murders and the epitaph\'s riddle are worth the same to Beato.
Like two sides on a balanced scale.
That means that the epitaph\'s riddle and massacring the entire family...
have equal significance from Beato\'s point of view......
But VIRGILIA responded with the red text.

Regardless of whether the epitaph is solved or not, Beato has nothing to gain.
If she has nothing to gain, then this epitaph\'s riddle...is meaningless and immaterial to Beato.
In that case, how much are the epitaph murders, which lie on the other side of the scales and are equal to the epitaph\'s riddle in value...
......worth to her...?
......Think, don\'t stop thinking......
The epitaph murders and solving the riddle of the epitaph have equal worth.
As long as the epitaph murders, which are Beato\'s goal each time, have this single way that they can be stopped, a way that she decided on herself, both are worth the same thing to her.
X=Y.
And whether the epitaph\'s riddle is solved or not, Beato gains nothing.
Y=0.
So, in this case, ......what is X......?
"................................."
"......Wait a sec.
 ......That means the epitaph murders are also meaningless and immaterial."
"......Beginning with politely sending us an advance notice,
 she\'s been willing to spend an incredible amount of effort killing us one by one, following the epitaph\'s steps in order, without getting exposed,
 every time she performs that bizarre serial murder.
 So all of that is meaningless to her...?"
I\'ve flipped over the chessboard many times exploring Beato\'s moves.
This was always the first place I stumbled.
The significance of the epitaph murders.
Why did she have to commit serial murders in a way that reproduced the witch\'s epitaph?
If she wanted to kill the whole Ushiromiya family for revenge, it would be much simpler, safer, and more reliable if she just put poison into their dinner,
 or else went around killing people one by one in the middle of the night while they were sleeping.
However, on the first evening, Beato sends us a letter that sounds like an advance notice,
 and then carries out what could be broadly described as a three‐part serial murder,
 killing six people on the first twilight, two on the second, and five on the fourth and later.
We aren\'t fools.
Once the first murders occur, we barricade ourselves in somewhere to stave off any further murders.
Furthermore, we quickly suspect a culprit among us and start analyzing each other\'s alibis.
As the victims increase, the number of suspects decreases automatically,
 and Beato\'s chances of completing the serial murder drop closer and closer to zero...
Everything about the epitaph murders......is full of useless ornament and empty decoration...
...that only seems to make it harder for her to carry out the serial murder.
".........She\'s raising the difficulty of completing her own objective."
"That does follow.
 ......She\'s a strange child, isn\'t she?"
"Did you know?
 In mystery novels, there are sometimes murders that follow the events of a poem or nursery rhyme, just like these epitaph murders.
 ......I think you can split the reasons these "nursery‐rhyme murders" occur into three major groups."
"......And what are those?"
"The first would be when it benefits the culprit to follow the epitaph and thereby confuse the evidence and alibis.
 ......The classic technique of pretending to be dead and mixing yourself in with the victims is an example of this,
 as is committing murders in an order that doesn\'t follow the epitaph so that you can cause the others to mistake the order and give yourself an alibi."
"I see.
 So she could make it look as though she was carrying out the murders in accordance with the epitaph, ......when she was actually guiding everyone\'s thinking in a manner that benefited her.
 That sounds interesting."
".........However, in our games, the dead are truly down for the count thanks to the red.
 ...She might be able to trick everyone in the world of the game board, but she can\'t trick us up here in the same way.
 ......In other words, the most traditional purpose for this kind of murder...isn\'t what we\'re dealing with here."
"In that case, what are the other two reasons for carrying out a nursery‐rhyme murder?"
"One is coincidence.
 ......The culprit carries out a serial murder which just happens to look similar to the epitaph without being intended to,
 and the witnesses mistakenly think it\'s a nursery‐rhyme murder.
 We humans try to find cause and effect in everything we see.
 ......If we think we know what something is, then that\'s how it looks to us."
"......I see.
 That\'s also interesting.
 ...However, I\'m not sure it\'s convincing.
 In this child\'s games, there\'s always an advance notice of the crime given before the murders of the first twilight.
 Also, I believe you find letters and circumstantial evidence one after another that clearly show the culprit is carrying out epitaph murders."
"Yeah, that\'s right.
 .........It isn\'t coincidence.
 From the very beginning, Beato has been intentionally shoving the epitaph murders in our faces as she carries them out.
 We aren\'t just misunderstanding.
 These murders clearly follow the epitaph.
 So this can\'t be the reason either."
"In that case, ......it must be your final reason."
"The last one.........is to show the murders to someone.
 In other words, to make them feel fear.
 ...By following the epitaph, she gives the others clear notice in advance that the murders will continue.
 The survivors are in constant fear of the murders, which they\'re certain will continue."
"...................................."
"In other words,
 ......this child performed these epitaph murders to create a feeling of mortal terror?"
"At least, ...putting it that way, everything makes a surprising amount of sense.
 ......The grotesque mutilation of the bodies and the disturbing displays were all a show to terrify us......"
"To terrify whom......?"
"Huh?
 ......Like I said, us.
 .............................."
After hearing that one line VIRGILIA spoke so casually, ......my thoughts clouded over once again...
Is it really enough...
to just use the vague word "us"......?
There are a lot of people in the Ushiromiya family.
There\'s the head and the one who holds the rank of his successor...Grandfather and Uncle Krauss.
Our parents, who have some pull in the business world.
......On the other side, you have the young cousins, who usually visit at most once a year,
 and the unfortunate servants, who just happened to be on duty.
......Even if the culprit hated all of us,
 ......they probably didn\'t hate all of us equally.
In other words, they might have made it clear which of those among us they particularly wanted to take revenge against and terrify.
If we liken this to a kid eating dessert......
Isn\'t the strawberry on top of a shortcake the part you should eat last?
No one tells you that you shouldn\'t eat it first, but our mentality leads us into saving it for later.
".........In that case, ...the culprit would want to leave the person they hated most until the end.
 ......Yeah, similar to what was said by my favorite character in this novel I like.
 Something about how if you start by killing the people closest to someone, make them feel that sadness, then kill that person last of all,
 that\'s the worst way to kill someone."
"Oh my, that must have been quite a terrifying novel.
 How frightening......"
"......In that case, you could argue that the people who stay alive until the end are the ones Beato hates the most.
 ......But the order people are killed in gets totally changed every single time.
 ......I mean, we all die in the end,
 but if you go through looking for someone who lives at least until the last twilight every time, there\'s...
.....................
 ..........................."
"...................................."
......There\'s only me.
".........Let me first speak with the red.
 
Battler‐kun, you are not the culprit.
 
You haven\'t killed anyone.
 
This can be said of all games."
"Then that.........just makes it even more likely that it\'s about me.
 ...It means the sole reason she had for bringing about the epitaph murders...was to show them to me."
Beato\'s always making out that she chooses who to kill next by roulette.
But I\'m an exception. The only exception.
 ......Though she does kill me in the end, she always leaves me be until the very last moment.
In all of these supposedly random games, there\'s only this one unchanging constant......
"She wants.........revenge? Against me?
 So is she performing the epitaph murders to make me feel fear...?"
"That\'s wrong.
 ......
Her goal is not to make someone experience fear.
 
And it isn\'t to have revenge on someone either."
"In that case!
 That means the epitaph murders really don\'t mean anything to her.
 The riddle of the epitaph is meaningless, and the corresponding epitaph murders are also meaningless.
 X=Y=0!
 But even so, she\'s clearly trying to show these meaningless things to me!"
"What could she want from me...which is worth the same to her as something meaningless?!
 ......I don\'t get it!!
 The more I think about it, the less I understand what she\'s thinking!"
"...................................."
BEATRICE,
 the fickle witch who committed a meaningless, worthless serial murder.
Even the riddle of the epitaph, which she made into a condition to suspend the serial murders,
 is meaningless, immaterial.
And......she\'s thrusting this meaningless, immaterial thing in front of my face.
......What is it......that you want from me...?
......Or else, what is it that you want to give me......?
My idea that Beato must have been taking revenge on me...has already been refuted in red by VIRGILIA.
Both X and Y...
Both the epitaph murders and the epitaph\'s riddle...mean nothing to Beato.
X=Y=0.
However, since she\'s thrusting that in front of me,
 ...it must...
...have some meaning.
She presents us a pair of scales representing "if you don\'t solve the epitaph, I\'ll carry out the epitaph murders".
Neither the epitaph murders nor the epitaph\'s riddle have any significance by themselves.
However, it becomes meaningful when she puts both halves on the scales and thrusts it out before us.........no, before me.
......In other words, it should be like this:
X=0.
Y=0.
X+Y>0.
A scale with meaningless, weightless things on both sides.
However, it has weight itself...and gives the rest meaning.
"......It\'s almost like......playing.
 Like kids playing rock‐paper‐scissors."
Rock‐paper‐scissors is the most immediate method of randomly determining a winner and a loser.
You usually bet some sort of privilege on the outcome,
 ......but kids often do rock‐paper‐scissors just to play, without betting anything in particular.
Unless you bet something, nothing but a feeling of joy or disappointment will come from a win or a loss.
In other words, the two sides of the scale, winning and losing, are both valueless.
However, the very act of seeing which way it will tip...
is the reason kids play rock‐paper‐scissors.
After all, the kids are enjoying the communication that surrounds the game,
 ......and they aren\'t purely interested in the value of winning or losing.
They aren\'t overly concerned about who wins and who loses......
"That would mean that it doesn\'t matter to Beato......whether the epitaph murders succeed or not.
 ......It almost feels like she\'s just enjoying the process."
"........................"
"......In the past, ...I would have cursed her, deciding that she was a heartless witch who kept murdering people for no reason.
 ......But now, I can\'t imagine that\'s true."
".........Thank you.
 In that case, I\'ll give you one more red.
 ...
Beato never committed murder for the sake of pleasure."
She didn\'t do it for pleasure, and she didn\'t do it to make anyone feel fear.
She has nothing to gain from the epitaph murders,
 and she doesn\'t care whether they succeed or fail.
It\'s almost like...a random game kids would play......
"No.
 ......It must have meaning.
 To her."
".........And what is...this meaning...?"
"I don\'t know.
 Even though neither side of the scale has any value, ......the scale itself has some weight to it in her eyes."
......Of course it isn\'t meaningless.
 Some meaning definitely exists.
In the previous game, she urged me to remember my sin of six years ago.
......Was that "meaningless" too?
No.
 There\'s no way that\'s the case.
I clearly remember the serious look in her eyes at that moment.
Unfortunately, I didn\'t have a clue what she was talking about.
......And she was devastated.
That\'s right.
At that time, I\'m sure she even went so far as to say that the crime wouldn\'t have occurred if I hadn\'t come.
"There is a meaning.
 .........A meaning to her.
 And she wants me to provide it."
".........................................."
I laughed softly and poked Beato lightly on the head,
 ......then patted her head.
"......Next time you want to send a love letter, I suggest that you just write "I love you".
 ...If you make it too roundabout and confusing, no one\'s gonna be able to figure it out."
".........*giggle*."
"I still don\'t have a clue what she\'s thinking.
 ......But even so,
 I won\'t stop thinking.
 ...I\'ve only just started flipping over the chessboard.
 ......I definitely won\'t give up......on this journey through your thoughts."
