I became the Halloween party princess,
 and the tournament of quizzes and riddles just for me began.
It looks like I get a medal for each puzzle I get right.
If I get a lot, I\'m supposed to get a wonderful prize from Grandfather.
Okay, here I go.
"Who should I start with?"
"I don\'t think it matters.
 Start with whomever you like."
"I\'d better think up a killer puzzle while I have the chance."
"Maria, didn\'t you have a quiz book in your bag?"
"Uu! I do!
 Kihihihihihi, I\'m gonna bully Ange with a mean one...!"
Maria onee-chan laughed with an evil smile.
Looks like everyone\'s going to try and bully me.
 I\'m sure they\'ll think up some really hard questions.
"Don\'t worry, I\'ll lend a hand."
"Really...?"
"Of course.
 After all, I\'m the princess\'s attendant.
 So, let\'s give it our all together and get a huge pile of medals."
"Okay...!"
"Come now, Ange-sama.
 Start wherever you want.
 I, Gohda, am ready to challenge you whenever you please."
"Whoa, not so fast.
 The honor of the first audience with the princess belongs to me.
 Ange, begin with my challenge...!"
"O-okay!"
I suddenly got tense, and my stomach began to feel tight.
Then, Auntie Eva gently held my hand.
"It\'ll be alright.
 Let\'s do this together!"
"O-......okay!"
"Then let us begin, Ange.
 This is a story about December 25th, Christmas Day."
"Christmas...?"
Even though it was October, he suddenly started talking about Christmas.
Is he going to ask what day Christmas is?
I know that.
 It\'s December 25th.
"On Christmas Day,
 a woman looked up at the night sky and said,
 "Eventually, the night will end, and morning will come.
 Wouldn\'t it be wonderful if, after the sun sinks and it becomes night once more, it could be Christmas again?"
 Then, the man beside her said,
 "Okay,
 I\'ll make your dream come true for you."
 Is such a thing possible...?"
"The day after Christmas is the 26th, a normal day.
 That\'s impossible."
"...Still Christmas, even after the sun rises......
 Oh, I\'ve got it."
"Huh? How?!
 How can the day after Christmas be Christmas again?!"
"Wahhahahahaha.
 Think about it for yourself, Ange."
