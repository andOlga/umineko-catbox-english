The uncomfortable atmosphere continued even after those two left.
It was thick with the idea that thinking about who the killer was would be the same as deciding who to doubt.
 ...It had begun to feel like discussion of the incidents was itself taboo.
So no one was mentioning it, at least out loud.
......However, those thoughts were what filled our minds.
All that we couldn\'t say aloud made our heads feel like they were going to explode...
So, at least on the outside, the parlor had once again regained its calm mood.
Though everything was left unsettled.
"......It feels like the rain\'s gotten a little lighter."
"Uu...?
 Still pouring down.
 Uu..."
"Even if it did stop, there\'s no boat on this island.
 ...But it\'d be nice if the boat came quickly tomorrow.
 I\'ve had enough of this Western mansion vacation, ihihi."
"Mom, when will the boat come tomorrow?"
"Originally, the boat to take them back would have arrived at three o\'clock today.
 They probably would have telephoned to say that they would come after the typhoon passed, but unfortunately, the telephones aren\'t working..."
"......But they aren\'t children over there.
 They were told this was for the purpose of dropping off and collecting our guests,
 so they will most likely arrive first thing tomorrow morning - 
probably around nine o\'clock, I believe."
It was completely black outside.
When I looked at the clock, I realized that it was just past seven.
I was starting to get hungry...
In the kitchen, Kumasawa was cooking enthusiastically.
She had laid out a variety of dishes, and while they didn\'t match the level of Gohda\'s artful cooking, they were still quite gorgeous.
It was an act of kindness from Kumasawa, trying to use food to enliven everyone\'s low spirits.
Kumasawa wasn\'t nearly as talented as a professional cook like Gohda, but she was far from unskilled.
...On the contrary, since she had been brought up in a fishing village, the simple food she created was sometimes very highly valued.
Kanon arranged the food Kumasawa had finished creating on plates, under her direction.
Kanon also helped in the kitchen sometimes, but since he was rarely placed in that role, he was slightly awkward, even though he tried his best...
Self-conscious about the fact that he couldn\'t skillfully arrange the food, Kanon\'s expression darkened slightly.
But Kumasawa smiled to say everything was fine.
"Hoh-hoh-ho, it\'s arranged beautifully.
 Kanon-kun, aren\'t you skilled."
"...............If it had been Shannon nee-san,
 ...it would be even more beautiful..."
Kanon stopped arranging the food for a bit, and hung his head...
Shannon was the one who always assisted Kumasawa in her cooking.
...Tonight, Kanon was doing it instead.
......And as he remembered Shannon\'s face, and her brutal end, he grimaced...
"............Forget it for now..."
Genji spoke kindly to Kanon as he advanced a pawn.
...Nanjo had escaped from the parlor once the mood had become sour, and Genji had become his opponent in a game of chess upon Nanjo\'s request.
".........Yes.
 ......I will forget it for now."
"...Good.
 That is probably for the best."
Genji purposefully faced away from Kanon as he spoke.
...He did so because he understood that it might make things tougher on Kanon if he noticed that someone was looking at his eyes.
Nanjo also understood that, and held back any thoughtless words.
"......I wonder where Kinzo-san has gone...
 ......I hope that he is safe, but..."
".........I do not know.
 ...Only, I think everything is as the Master hoped - as he has arranged.
 ......To distrust that would exceed my role as furniture working for the Master."
"...Aren\'t you scared, Genji-san...?
 I am frightened something bad will occur again tonight..."
"............I have nothing to be afraid of.
 ...I simply work for the Ushiromiya family."
Nanjo sighed through his nose, and made a carefully considered move.
...Nanjo was very slightly dubious.
 ......Could Genji possibly think that he would be left out of this?
He couldn\'t begin to imagine what was happening inside this mansion.
...But he definitely couldn\'t deny the possibility that it was something of Kinzo\'s design.
...If you liken this island to chess, Kinzo had opened the game, and as a result, six pieces had fallen.
......Could it be that Genji was calm because he believed that he alone was outside the chessboard, and safe?
Nanjo thought about it.
 ......Wasn\'t everyone just a piece on this chessboard, lined up equally, without any exceptions?
......Wasn\'t even Genji, who had gained more of Kinzo\'s trust than anyone,
 ...no, wasn\'t Nanjo himself, although proud of his position as Kinzo\'s only close friend,
 ...just another one of the pieces laid out on the chessboard?
".........Genji-san.
 ...I am really frightened about tonight.
 ......I\'m hoping with all my heart that we will be still be safe when tomorrow morning comes..."
The guest room that Eva and Hideyoshi had moved into was used to house guests before the guesthouse had been constructed.
So until a few years ago, they had stayed in this room every family conference and were very familiar with it.
This room, just like a room at a hotel, had a bedroom and a bathroom,
 so even though they were still shut in, it was far more comfortable than the parlor.
"Guess it\'s true you can relax more when you\'re alone with your immediate family.
 ......They should all just do this, shut themselves in guest rooms and lock the doors."
"But Natsuhi nee-san\'s throwing her weight around, saying no one can leave the parlor.
 How can any of them talk back?"
"She always felt she was being left out in the cold, so now that Nii-san\'s dead, she\'s in high spirits, thinking her time has finally come.
 ...Seriously, how shameless can she be."
"...Come now, don\'t say that.
 Natsuhi-san\'s workin\' pretty hard.
 No need to jump on her like that.
 .........And about that receipt earlier, you went too far there."
"......Aww, come on.
 If I hadn\'t said it there, there wouldn\'t be another good time to say it..."
Eva, sulking cutely, sat down beside Hideyoshi, who was lying on the bed watching TV.
"Still, ............it\'s been a very long time since we\'ve been alone like this."
"Sure has.
 When I think about it, both you and I have gotten older.
 Since George was born, everything\'s gone by in the blink of an eye."
"...It really has gone by in the blink of an eye.
 ......I wonder if we were too hasty in having a child."
Eva\'s eyes looked like they were staring off into the distance.
......Yes, she had thought it a once-in-a-lifetime chance.
...Her older brother Krauss had been unable to have a child for quite some time.
Six years passed after his marriage to Natsuhi without any signs of pregnancy, which didn\'t please Kinzo at all.
As for Eva herself, she would be removed from the Ushiromiya register anyway once she got married, so whether a successor to the head was born or not, it was all the same to her.
 ...So she had thought.
But then, one day,
 ......she had a heavenly revelation.
......Or maybe it was the whisperings of the devil that she had heard in her greed.
Perhaps she could remain in the Ushiromiya register if she gave birth to a successor first?
...If things went well, perhaps she could even inherit the Ushiromiya family herself...?
When she proposed this to Hideyoshi, he approved of it instantly.
......This had not been because Hideyoshi also had greedy thoughts.
...For Hideyoshi, who had no close relatives,
 it was a chance for him to feel once more that long-forgotten thing called family.
So he agreed, without hesitation, not to fuss over which family name they were to keep upon getting married, and assented to having his name entered into the Ushiromiya family register.
It wasn\'t easy to persuade Kinzo, but as his daughter, Eva knew Kinzo\'s personality well.
......So, she chose the time when Kinzo was most dissatisfied with Natsuhi,
 and expertly managed to make him accept Hideyoshi as a son-in-law.
......Looking at Hideyoshi, who had achieved success after starting from nothing, Kinzo might have seen a little bit of himself.
He quickly grew to like Hideyoshi, and permitted him to transfer into the Ushiromiya register...
George would eventually become the successor to the Ushiromiya family.
They had raised him strictly with that purpose in mind.
George had been worth their while, and had grown into a fabulous young man who wouldn\'t disappoint no matter where he went.
...That was why she couldn\'t stand that he was in love with a servant like Shannon.
......So when she had learned that Shannon had died and the engagement had been invalidated,
 ......while part of her had been shocked at the gruesome crime,
 another part of her had been relieved that her precious George wouldn\'t be stolen by some servant girl...
"..................
 .........I...
......always did hate Krauss nii-san.
 He was so full of himself, always swaggering around.
 So proud that he would one day become the head."
"......So I wanted to get back at him.
 ...Those were just my emotions as a child, of course...?
 But in the end, those emotions......took over my entire life.
 And if only that had been all!
 ......Because of those emotions, I got you and George involved, and I used you."
"............Eva, don\'t blame yourself so much."
Hideyoshi sat up and put his arm around Eva.
......She could feel a warm understanding from him.
"...Well, I reached the halfway point in my life long ago.
 ...But you know, I have never once regretted how I\'ve lived my life.
 Not once."
".........I think that since I\'ve been with you, Eva, I\'ve been able to relish an enjoyable life that other men never will.
 ......After I lost my relatives in the war, you taught me once more what the warmth of family is.
 So I\'m grateful for the Ushiromiya family, and think of it as my only family."
".........In this life I\'ve led with you, not a single thing has been wasted.
 It\'s really been a fun life up to today."
"......Thank you,
 ......honey."
Eva hung her head, burying her face in Hideyoshi\'s chest...
......Probably, no one in the parlor could even imagine that this side of Eva existed.
"I\'m the one who should be thankin\' you.
 To this day, there hasn\'t been a single day that I\'ve regretted being with you!"
"...............Me too.
 I\'m so glad...to have you by my side."
"George is already a fine adult.
 He\'s a man who can do his job well on his own, even if I\'m not there lookin\' out for him.
 ......How about it?
 Around New Year\'s, do you wanna go spend some time in the Maldives?
 Just us two, no one else."
"......No wayyy.
 Aren\'t you always saying that you\'re so busy responding to New Year\'s cards that you don\'t even sleep...?"
"None of that this New Year\'s!
 I won\'t read New Year\'s cards.
 I\'ll just stay quiet and check to see if I\'ve won the New Year\'s lottery.
 It\'d sure be nice if we won a color TV this year!"
"No wayyyy...
 I don\'t wanna check the lottery in the Maldiiives..."
"Then none of that either!
 ......Just the two of us, takin\' our time, carryin\' on from when we were newlyweds, just before George was born."
".........Yeah.
 ...That does sound nice..."
"I hear the Maldives are wonderful.
 An island with nothin\' on it, surrounded by beaut\'ful coral reefs and cottages lined up over the water..."
"......Carrying on from when we were newlyweds... When will that be...?"
"Soon as I\'ve finished some business.
 I won\'t know until I ask the travel agency, but probably before New Year\'s Eve - "
"No way.
 .........Right now,
 ...I want to start right now."
Peevishly, or maybe coquettishly, Eva pled for his lips...
The only sounds that filled the room were the distant voice of the announcer on the news, which Hideyoshi had left on, and the obnoxious pounding of the rain against the window...
There was a knock on the door, and Genji-san entered.
".........Madam.
 Dinner has been prepared.
 Will you eat in here again...?"
"...Yes.
 Bring it here.
 Is Doctor Nanjo still in the kitchen?"
"............Yes.
 He has said that he wishes to carefully deliberate over his next move.
 ...Do not worry, he is with the other servants."
"Genji-san\'s good enough at chess to be Grandfather\'s opponent.
 I hear he\'s even better than Doctor Nanjo, you know?"
"...Is that right.
 I played against him long ago, but he must have let me win."
"Maria, sounds like it\'ll be time to eat soon.
 But look at you, you\'ve been watching TV all day long and you still haven\'t gotten bored!"
"Uu.
 I\'m always watching TV so I\'m fine.
 Uu."
"Heh, Maria-chan sure is a TV kid."
"Food\'s coming, so we have to clean up the table."
It was still cluttered with the aftermath of the drawing contest we had all been having, using several pages torn out of Maria\'s notebook.
Jessica began cleaning that up quickly.
......Still, everyone here sure can draw.
 Really shocking.
"......Genji.
 Ask Eva-san and Hideyoshi-san whether they would at least like to have dinner with us.
 ......Although they will probably turn us down."
"...Certainly."
"First Father, now Eva-san...
 We seem incapable of managing a full showing at the Ushiromiya dinner table."
Natsuhi felt her headache start throbbing again, and lightly held her temples...
The distance from the kitchen to the parlor wasn\'t that large, so Genji had gone there and back by himself, but the guest room was a little farther away.
Natsuhi had warned him not to be alone without good reason,
 and just now, Nanjo had also admonished him, saying that it would be better if he held a little more concern for his safety.
...Genji took Kanon with him, and the two of them went to visit Eva and Hideyoshi in their guest room.
Genji knocked on the door.
"......Eva-sama, Hideyoshi-sama.
 Dinner has been prepared."
He waited a short while for them to come out, but there was no response.
"............Genji-sama, ......look at this."
Kanon pointed under the door.
......A Western-style envelope had been inserted under it.
Normally, when something was inserted this way, it would be interpreted as a message from someone outside to someone in the room.
...So, since this might be a private note meant for Eva and Hideyoshi, it was not something that Kanon and Genji were supposed to take interest in.
...But this Western-style envelope...
...was Kinzo\'s envelope, the same as the one Maria had taken out last night and surprised everyone with.
".....................
 ...There\'s no mistake.
 It\'s the Master\'s envelope."
"......Or...
........."
Although it had been Kinzo\'s envelope, ......the author of the letter Maria had read aloud last night had not been Kinzo......
Genji continued knocking a little harder and called out in a loud voice.
"Eva-sama.
 Eva-sama...!
 It is Genji.
 Are you there?!
 Please answer, Eva-sama...!!"
But there was no response from inside.
Sometimes, when the servants went to call some guests for a meal, the guests would be sleeping so deeply that they wouldn\'t wake up.
...In times like that, the servants would stick a letter in the door to show that they had called by, and then leave the guest be.
......However, despite that, Genji beat even harder on the door and called out Eva\'s name.
But there was no answer.
Kanon stuck his ear up to the door, and holding his breath, listened for any sounds coming from inside...
"............I hear something that sounds like the television.
 ...But I don\'t sense anyone.
 ...The room might be empty..."
Genji took out a handkerchief, and, careful not to touch it with his bare hands,
 gently pulled out the envelope which had been stuck under the door...
It had been sealed with deep red sealing wax.
...Without a doubt, the mark on that sealing wax had come from the Ushiromiya Family Head\'s Ring...
"Eva-sama!
 Eva-sama!!
 Please answer!!
 Are you still in your room?!"
Even so, there was still no answer...
There was a chance that the two were aimlessly walking around the mansion.
...This was the home Eva had grown up in.
There was plenty of reason to think that she had gone out on a casual stroll...
Genji groped around in his pocket, and pulled out a bundle of keys including the one that would open the guest room.
"......Genji-sama...?!"
Kanon also understood what this meant.
......They would sometimes unlock a guest\'s door so they could go in and do things like make the beds, but only after they had made sure the guest was out.
To unlock the door for a separate reason, and especially to do so when there was a chance the guests were still in there and without their permission, was an action unbecoming of a servant.
...However, Genji had decided.
 .........If the only problem had been that his knock hadn\'t received a reply, he wouldn\'t have gone this far.
But the envelope under the door was doubtlessly Kinzo\'s.
......Or rather, one of the Western-style envelopes of the Ushiromiya family head.
...And after last night, the sender of this envelope could be someone other than Kinzo.
......If this letter had been sent by someone other than Kinzo.........
"Eva-sama...!
 My apologies.
 Allow me to enter your room..."
After giving that final notice, Genji stuck one of the keys from the bundle into the keyhole.
There was the sound of the door unlocking.
 ......And then, he slowly turned the knob, and slowly started opening the door.
Light seeped through the crack of the door.
......Were they in the room?
 Or had they......forgotten to turn out the lights...?
Clank.
...It was the sound of the door chain being pulled tight.
The chain had been secured.
The chain couldn\'t be secured from the outside.
That meant that they were in the room now.
The sound of voices on the TV seeped out of the room.
...The lights, the chain, and the TV.
All of these things made it clear that they were in the room,
 .........but there was no sign of them.
Genji called to Eva once again through the crack of the door.
But there was no answer.
".....................Genji-sama...
 ............What should we do...?"
As part of their job, the servants were able to unlock almost any lock in the mansion.
But they had no way to open a door with a chain.
......The only way to get by the chain was to cut it.
...That was certainly not permitted as part of a servant\'s usual work.
......A creepy chill was already rushing up their backs...
Kanon held his breath again and tried to sense someone through the door, but even so, he was not able to sense anyone.
"...............I\'ll go call Madam.
 ...Kanon, cut the chain."
"Y-......yes...!"
As Kanon rushed away hurriedly to get a cutting tool, he was called back by Genji.
"Wait, Kanon...!
 .........Go back to the kitchen and take Kumasawa with you.
 Whatever you do, do not act alone."
"......Yes...
 Certainly..."
It looked like Kanon was wondering why he had to do something so troublesome in the middle of this urgent situation.
......But Genji had said it out of wariness.
...He didn\'t care what happened to himself.
......But in the worst case scenario, he didn\'t want anything to happen to Kanon.
In the kitchen was Kumasawa, who was piling food on the serving cart,
 and Nanjo, who seemed to have thought of a move that would turn the tables on Genji, and had been awaiting his return, wanting to show him.
...But he immediately realized that something was wrong with Genji\'s demeanor.
"......Oh, ......what has happened, Genji-san..."
".........Doctor Nanjo, my apologies, but please allow me to suspend this match for a time.
 .........Kanon, take care of the chain.
 Kumasawa, stop setting up dinner for now and accompany Kanon.
 I will go over to Madam.
 If you would come with me, Doctor Nanjo."
"Ha-...has something happened......?"
Genji took Nanjo, who still didn\'t know what was going on, and quickly left the kitchen.
"...Kumasawa-san.
 My apologies, but please come with me."
"Wh-...what happened, Kanon-san......?"
Unable to take in the situation, Kumasawa said almost exactly the same thing as Nanjo, and chased after Kanon, who had flown out into the hallway...
Accompanied by Kumasawa, Kanon went to the storehouse,
 and from amongst the tools packed in toolboxes and hanging on the walls, he looked for a tool that could be used to cut the chain.
"What are you looking for...?
 ...I will help......"
"......We\'re cutting a door chain.
 ...Where was that large bolt cutter..."
"A door chain...?
 Wh-why would you do something like that...?"
"............The chain is locked to Eva-sama and Hideyoshi-sama\'s room.
 ...Even though they should be inside, when we called to them, they didn\'t answer."
It took Kumasawa some time to figure out how cutting the chain and Eva and Hideyoshi not answering were connected, but she did realize that this was an urgent situation.
"This will probably..."
Kanon took down a very large bolt cutter that had been hanging on the wall.
It was called a cutter, but maybe it would be easier to understand if described as having the shape of a large pair of pliers.
......He recalled being warned that it was a dangerous tool that could easily cut through one of your fingers...
Kanon took that and rushed up the stairs.
.........He knew it instinctively.
 ...He should fight for every minute, every second to open it quickly.
............Or maybe,
 ......already............
"Please wait, Kanon-san......!
 Haah, ...haah...!"
"......Hurry!"
Kumasawa eventually caught up with him, gasping for breath with both hands on her knees.
When Kanon changed his grip on the bolt cutter and looked up at the door, he let out an "ah", struck speechless...
".........Wh-
......what is this.........
 .........hiiiiiiiii......"
Kumasawa screamed weakly, her face pallid...
That was no surprise...
 Because, right there, .........on the door, ......just like the magic circle that had been drawn on the shutter of the rose garden storehouse,
 there was another eerie shape drawn with paint that looked like blood.
However, it was dubious whether this one could be called a "magic circle".
...Because, unlike what most people would think of as a magic circle, it wasn\'t a circle with shapes drawn inside it,
 but a slightly more geometrical shape.
......However, the strange non-alphabetical characters written in the gaps of the figure were without doubt the same as the magic circle on the shutter...
But the thing that had Kanon struck speechless was not how eerie the magic circle was.
......Only moments ago, this hadn\'t been here...!!
He had returned to the kitchen for a short while.
 He had then gone to the storehouse to grab a tool, and headed right back.
Put those together and it couldn\'t have been more than five minutes.
...How could someone add something this creepy during that period of time...?!
And as though it had just been drawn,
 almost like the door itself was bleeding, several unsettling vertical red lines slowly dripped down, getting longer and longer......
"......hiiiiiiiiiii... ......hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii...!"
Kumasawa\'s knees gave way, and she sank down on the spot.
...If Kumasawa hadn\'t done this first, then Kanon surely would have wanted to.
"......B-BEATRICE...sama..............."
"Hiiiiiiiiiii...!
 It\'s the work of BEATRICE-sama, how horrid, how horrid...!!"
"...........................hh."
Kanon gulped, then readied the bolt cutter and approached the door.
...He didn\'t want to get close to this disturbing magic circle, and he really didn\'t want to touch the steadily dripping substance that looked like blood.
......But if he didn\'t get close, he couldn\'t cut the chain.
Fighting this cold feeling, he gulped again, and after gathering his courage, went even closer, putting the bolt cutter up against the chain.
......He then pressed with all of his strength, and cut through the chain far more easily than he had imagined.
The cut chain fell into two separate parts, which continued to clang as they swayed back and forth...
".........Kanon-san,
 .........by your feet, an envelope......
 ...And isn\'t that...the Master\'s......"
It looked like Kumasawa had also noticed the Western-style envelope at the bottom of the door.
And that the sealing wax had been sealed with the Head\'s Ring.
Kanon was lost for a just a second over whether he should open the letter first or check inside the room,
 but he decided on prioritizing his original purpose.
...Kanon pulled a handkerchief out of his pocket.
This was so he wouldn\'t leave fingerprints on the door.
......If his worst fears had been realized, .........the police would want to investigate this room too...!!
He slowly pushed the door open...
 He was able to hear the sound of the television that had been seeping out slightly more clearly now.
"........................Eva-sama......?"
Eva was face up on the bed.
......On the bed with her shoes still on...?
Kumasawa, who had fearfully entered after Kanon and who was hiding behind his back, screamed a short "hii!!" again when she saw Eva like that.
Eva\'s shoes had been the first part of her that Kanon had seen, so the incongruity of wearing shoes in bed was the first thing that entered his mind,
 ...but after he shifted his line of sight towards Eva\'s head,
 ...Kanon couldn\'t help but let out a short scream like Kumasawa...
Right in the middle...of Eva\'s forehead, ......something was...
......set there?
 Growing there...?
No.
 ...Right in the center of her forehead,
 ...an old-fashioned "knife",
 or some weapon like it, was stuck right in!!!
From the base where it was stuck in, blood dripped down, staining the sheets on the other side bright red...
Kumasawa\'s knees gave way once more, and she sank down on the floor.
...Her mouth kept flapping open and closed, but she couldn\'t even scream.
......Eva, with some kind of weapon sticking out of her forehead, was dead.
Both eyes were open wide, and the image of the person who killed her must have been burned into them,
 ...but the mouth with which to speak that truth had already been eternally sealed.
Even though that forehead was the last place they wanted to look, they couldn\'t tear their eyes from it...
Right there, the weapon was stuck into Eva\'s forehead, standing almost perfectly upright.
And on the handle was a design so complicated you could never expect to see it on an ordinary weapon.
......That thing...could be summed up with the word "occult".
...It was a vulgar object, with a design that might have been of some demon.
"......What about Hideyoshi-sama...?
 ...Hideyoshi-sama...!"
Eva was on top of her bed, but the other bed was empty.
...Where was Hideyoshi?!
After taking a backwards glance at Kumasawa, still on her knees and stupefied, he checked the bathroom just in case.
At the moment he opened the door, he was greeted by steam and the sound of the shower.
The bathroom was of the same familiar style as most hotel bathrooms, containing both a bath and a toilet.
When taking a shower, a waterproof curtain was used to keep water from flying out.
That waterproof curtain was half open,
 ......and lying tumbled down in the bathtub was Hideyoshi, completely naked, both eyes still open - 
and those eyes were pointing right at Kanon.
Just like Eva, a weapon with a demonic design was stuck into his forehead.
Since his head had been under the hot water of the shower the whole time, his face wasn\'t half covered and filthy with blood like Eva\'s had been,
 ...but the sight of him dead while still taking a shower was tragic enough......
Just then, Natsuhi\'s voice rang through the hall.
She was probably coming with Genji.
"......A-again with this graffiti......
 ...What about this letter...?
 What does it say inside?"
"...I have not yet read it."
".........We shouldn\'t touch it carelessly...
 The culprit\'s fingerprints might be left on it...
 We should hand it over to the police..."
"......They went out of their way to leave it here.
 I\'m sure they wouldn\'t have left fingerprints."
Stating this with finality, Natsuhi picked up the envelope.
...And before checking its contents, she entered the room herself, ......where she found Eva, dead.
"E-......Eva-san......!!!!"
"......Madam... Hideyoshi-sama is here, too............"
"Th-......this is......
truly atrocious......"
"...Kanon, turn off the shower...
 Don\'t let this be any more pitiful than it needs to...!"
"Y-...yes."
Kanon gripped his handkerchief and twisted the valve, turning off the shower.
In the bathtub, a small bottle of body soap had fallen with its cap off.
......It really looked like he had been attacked right in the middle of taking a shower.
......A spray of blood still clung slightly to the white bathtub, and the combination of red and white made a horrible contrast.
"............Doctor Nanjo..."
"...I, ......I understand......
 ......No signs of postmortem lividity...
 Rigor mortis hasn\'t begun either.
 I\'d say barely an hour has passed since they were killed, if that..."
"But even so, ......how a weapon with such a short handle could do that to the skull......
 I cannot imagine..."
Nanjo checked their pulse and their pupils, making certain of their deaths once more.
...As Kanon watched this businesslike treatment, he thought.
......Couldn\'t you tell at a glance that they\'re dead without doing all that?
Nanjo thought about removing the weapon,
 but after deciding that where possible it would be better to hand the scene over to the police without disturbing it, he left it alone.
However, a close examination of the base revealed that it had no blade.
...Or rather, it wasn\'t shaped like a flat blade, but was conical.
...He noticed that, rather than a knife, it was more like a short-handled spear, something with a shape better suited for thrusting than slicing.
Rather than a short spear, some people might call it a thick icepick.
At any rate, the original hideous purpose for which this weapon with its unsettling design was made,
 and exactly how that purpose was carried out, were both displayed here in such a glaring fashion that there was absolutely no need to use further words to describe it...
Natsuhi, hoping to escape the repulsive steam filling the bathroom as soon as she could,
 covered her mouth with a handkerchief and dashed from the room...
Just viewing their gruesome bodies for an instant had been enough to burn the image into her eyes.
 If she looked any longer, that image would surely remain in her vision for all eternity...
The rising urge to vomit was exactly the same feeling she\'d had that morning at the gardening storehouse...
For a while, Natsuhi couldn\'t help but stand with her back facing the guest room, fighting that sickness in her stomach...
"......A-.........anyway, we can\'t let the kids,
 ...we can\'t let George-kun see this room.
 Quickly, close this room up...!"
".........Gra-...gracious, no, it shouldn\'t be shown to them...
 If George-san saw his parents in this brutal state......"
But the recklessly approaching footsteps were obviously George\'s even before he came flying into the room.
George and the other children had been waiting in the parlor.
But when they had seen Genji call Natsuhi out, and had noticed her turn pale and fly out of the room, they had felt that he might have been the bearer of bad news.
And when they saw a large group of people gathered around the guest room, they were sure of it...
"Father!!!
 Mother!!!"
".........Aaahh,
 wha-......what is this,
 another......magic circle?!"
"...................................."
"Auntie Eva and Uncle Hideyoshi are safe, right?!
 Hey, Kanon-kun!
 What\'s this all about?!"
"...Battler-sama...
 ................................."
Kanon didn\'t have to say anything; George\'s scream after he ran into the room told them everything they needed to know.
"......UwaaaaaaaaaaaaaAAAAAAAAAAAaaaaa!!
 Who,
 ......who did this!!
 I\'ll kill you, I\'ll kill you!!!"
"...George-kun,
 .........hang in there, dear......"
Natsuhi touched George\'s shoulder with her hand, but he violently shook her off.
...George collapsed to the floor beside Eva, and buried his face in the bed in front of his mother\'s face, wailing.
Then he pounded on the bed with his fist, over and over again...
".........Geor-
...George nii-san,
 ......ha-hang in there......
 .........huh,
 ...Battler?"
"............Battler-sama..."
Battler.........had his back against the wall of the hallway,
 ......and was, without restraint, covering his eyes with his right hand and weeping......
"Horrible......
 ............That\'s horrible......
 ......He proposed to the girl he loved and lost her the next day.
 .........And on the same day, even his mom and dad were killed...
 ............Isn\'t that...just way too harsh......"
...Of course, he felt sorry for everyone who had died.
But Battler......felt far more sorry for those who had been left alone by the deaths of others.
Everyone here now had lost someone close to them.
George wasn\'t the only one he felt sorry for.
......However, ...George\'s pain was far greater than everyone else\'s.
"..................Battler........."
"Sure, ...all people die sooner or later...
 If you\'re human, the day\'s going to eventually come when you\'ve got to fight the sorrow of losing someone close to you.
 ...But still, shouldn\'t that day be far in the future for Aniki,
 ......and shouldn\'t those deaths visit him one at a time...?!!"
"......Horrible...
 That\'s too horrible......
 ......Bastard......
 Bastard.........!
 Don\'t you have......the slightest bit of human compassion...?!!
 Uuuuuuuuuuughhhh!!!"
".........Uu...
 Battler, ...don\'t cry, don\'t cry..."
Maria tried to comfort Battler in a mechanical-sounding voice...
Battler violently wiped his tears.
"Aah...
 Damn it, ...I won\'t cry anymore...
 Tears of regret, tears of sadness, I won\'t shed them again..."
".........Yeah, it\'s no goddamn good at all.
 The witch is backing us into a corner.
 We\'re always on the defensive...!
 And that\'s no good, it\'s no goddamn good!
 I\'ll flip over the chessboard...!!
 That bastard probably thinks of us like sheep, just cowering in fear until tomorrow with no way of running."
"...But guess what, I\'ll flip it over!!
 That bastard can\'t escape this island until tomorrow either...!
 We won\'t be the ones hiding away pissing ourselves, that fucker will!"
"I\'ll expose you, you\'ll see.
 By tomorrow - 
no, forget tomorrow, tonight.
 Before this night\'s over I\'ll be gripping you by the collar...!!"
