"...........................Now then.
 How will the game be resolved this time?
 ...You may submit, and you may resist.
 ......Either way, it will truly be an entertaining banquet worth betting my short remaining life on."
In his dimly lit study, which was occasionally brightened by lightning,
 Kinzo kept mumbling to himself, laughing to himself.
On the antique clock with an intricate design that was sitting on his desk,
 the two overlapping hands had begun to tilt to the right, and separate from one another.
The passage of time that had counted to 24 had returned to 0, and begun to start counting again...
"......The passage of time is a brutal thing.
 It drags itself all the way to 24 over the course of a day, and then returns back to 0.
 ......It surely managed to count to 23:59.
 However, was it ever able to reach 24:00?
 ......If you believe that it returns to 0:00 again without reaching it, how futile it seems."
No, is that not the same as a person\'s life?
 You live, aiming for a perfect 24, and in the instant you reach it, you return to 0.
People may praise the departed, saying that they did reach 24, but that is absolutely not 24.
.........It is nothing more than 0.
"I am different.
 ......I will reach 24 alive.
 Because that itself is the Golden Land.
 ...That is BEATRICE\'s dwelling."
Kinzo had been fumbling around with some tarot cards for some time.
It looked as though he was trying to divine his own luck, his own propensity for victory, and doing it over every time he didn\'t like the result.
The most forbidden action in tarot reading is to try predicting the same thing twice.
It is a desecration to the result of the fortune telling,
 and also desecrates the existence higher than humans which delivers signs through the tarot cards.
However, Kinzo knew.
The reason the tarot cards shouldn\'t be used twice was that, since it was nothing more than a random number generator,
 it was natural that if you read them twice, a different result would appear.
......Therefore, reading twice was only forbidden to preserve the mystique of the tarot cards\' results.
...However, that didn\'t mean that Kinzo didn\'t take tarot reading seriously.
Kinzo\'s interpretation of tarot reading was done in a completely different way.
That was to repeat the reading, over and over, until he reached the result most favorable to him,
 without the slightest amount of compromise.
It would depend on how he defined the result most favorable to him,
 but if he demanded the best result in a strict sense,
 it would be the same as a simple roulette of luck, where he sought an arithmetic miracle.
......However, to Kinzo, who made miracles of numbers the basis of his magical power, this could become very much like a magic ritual.
In other words,
 until the result he desired appeared perfectly, he would repeat the tarot readings over and over, turning his labor, conviction, and the feelings of his heart into a prayer,
 so that when it reached heaven, the result would be sublimated - this was Kinzo\'s personal magical interpretation.
Therefore, even though the tarot cards Kinzo used were exactly the same as generally used tarot cards,
 the way they were used was completely different...
".................................
 ...Tonight, ......it refuses to go my way."
Kinzo stopped his hands for a second.
...It seemed the result he expected wasn\'t showing up.
On the contrary, many bad cards that shouldn\'t often appear were appearing repeatedly,
 and continuing to interfere with the miracle Kinzo wished for.
"..................Hmph.
 ...Is that how it is?"
It seemed that Kinzo had taken some kind of sign from this abnormal course of events.
But judging by the unlucky cards scattered over the desk, it was difficult to imagine that the sign had been a good one...
For a while, Kinzo closed his eyes tightly, pondering something.
Then as the thunder roared, he made up his mind about something, took the telephone receiver, and dialed.
"............It is I.
 Is Genji there? It is urgent."
"..................haah."
In front of the main entrance, Shannon was cooling her flushed face in the frigid air.
...She had thought...
...that George\'s proposal would surely come sometime.
It wasn\'t as if her heart had been unprepared.
And she had nodded as an answer.
Had she been reckless because of her youth?
Should she have thought about her future more seriously?
She found herself worrying that he might have thought of her as a cheap girl because of her immediate reply.
...Perhaps at least holding off until tomorrow morning would have given the impression of thinking more seriously?
Now that she had already received the ring from George,
 Shannon kept fidgeting in embarrassment, thinking she should have done this, should have done that.
As she did, she heard the sound of footsteps coming towards her, splashing through puddles.
Shannon immediately chased away the emotions welling up inside her.
"......Genji-sama?
 Kanon-kun too...!
 I, I\'m sorry, for not coming back right away, umm..."
She grew stiff, thinking that she would surely be scolded for spending too much time in her secret lover\'s meeting with George.
"Shannon.
 The Master has told us to come to the study urgently.
 Let us hurry."
"......Huh?
 Y-yes, certainly...!
 What in the world...?"
"He said he had an ominous premonition.
 ......How selfish, when he was the one who chose to start this ritual."
"We will enter from the back, so that Gohda doesn\'t notice us.
 Hide your footsteps."
"Yes.
 .........Nee-san, take care.
 You\'re so noisy."
Kanon was especially good at hiding his presence.
...Like he was a cat.
 He was able to suddenly be there without anyone noticing, and leave in the same way.
So, even if he were to step in a puddle,
 the sound he would make would be far smaller than that of the rain hitting the puddles...
Genji also had that ability.
 ...Well, in the first place, that was how the servants were supposed to be, even going by the name of furniture.
Just like how desks and closets go unnoticed by members of the family,
 the servants also treated being able to show up unobtrusively when they needed to as their greatest virtue.
In that sense, Shannon\'s footsteps still strongly asserted themselves.
...She was also trying to hide her footsteps,
 but compared to Kanon and Genji, well, you could say she was a little more lively...
Eventually they reached the back door, and the three of them entered the mansion.
Immediately, .........they thought they felt something.
It wasn\'t quite a sense of smell, ...rather, they felt it from the depths of their noses,
 ......and this hard-to-describe sensation, which you might call a sixth sense, allowed them to perceive that something was different than usual.
"............Genji-sama."
"...Yes. We must hurry."
That perception caused them to feel that something tense was closing in on them.
Realizing that, the three of them dashed up the stairs, aiming for Kinzo\'s study, still hiding their footsteps.
When they dashed up the stairs, ...that smell of sweet poison particular to Kinzo\'s study reached their noses.
".....................hm."
"What is it, Genji-sama...?"
"......The barrier is...dead."
"Huh?
 ...............Ah."
After hearing Kanon, she looked at the door to the study.
A scorpion pattern was engraved on the doorknob.
A powerful magic-repellent.
 The final barrier, which protected Kinzo himself.
It had been broken.
Of course, there was no change to the doorknob that the eye could see.
However, they who could understand things that people couldn\'t perceive, were able to recognize the dramatic change...
"......My lord.
 My lord...!
 It is Genji.
 Please open this door."
Genji called in this way after knocking several times, but there was no answer from the study.
"Shannon, protect our backs.
 Kanon, search inside the room."
""Yes...!""
Kanon put his ear against the door, searching for a presence inside the study.
To protect the backs of the other two, who were watching the door, Shannon faced the other way, with her back to them, prepared for the unexpected.
"............The Master is here, I believe.
 ...However, it\'s too quiet."
"Then he is safe?"
"No.
 It is too quiet."
"...It............couldn\'t be..."
"My lord.
 Excuse us about the door."
Genji pulled a gold key out of his pocket.
It was the only key to the study that existed, other than the one Kinzo held.
He stuck it in the keyhole, and turned it heavily.
......At a glance, that would have indicated that it really was a strong lock.
However, the fact that the barrier had been destroyed...
meant that this door had long been wide open for anyone with magical power...
The lock made a heavy sound, indicating that the door had been opened to humans as well.
"......Excuse me."
As Genji respectfully bowed his head,
 and Kanon\'s sense of tension grew tighter,
 and Shannon acted nervous, they entered the study...
They immediately discovered Kinzo\'s figure.
......He was sitting in a reception sofa so that his back faced them.
Genji noticed the person sitting across from him, and again bowed deeply.
Kanon also noticed that person,
 ......and he didn\'t bow his head.
He went in front of Shannon and spread both arms, blocking the way to her.
So without even seeing that person\'s face, Shannon already had a good idea who it was...
"...So you have come.
 BEATRICE-sama."
"Genji, is it?
 You came very quickly.
 Yes, it is better when furniture answers its master\'s call quickly.
 Very different from this person."
"........................
 ......So Ronove-sama has come as well."
Genji directed his greeting towards the thin darkness behind and to the right of BEATRICE, where nothing appeared to be.
Even Kanon and Shannon couldn\'t have imagined that someone would be there.
......However, the darkness answered immediately, and praised Genji\'s eyesight...
"As usual, you don\'t disappoint.
 It has been quite some time.
 .........Dear me, you have gotten old, haven\'t you?
 Have you really reached that age?"
"I have lived a full life.
 ...It appears that your life has grown to be even more full, Ronove-sama."
"Yes.
 Thank you.
 .........And Shannon, it has been a long time since I last saw you, as well.
 You have grown quite beautiful.
 And, it seems that you have grown quite strong.
 It is good to see."
"............Thank you very much."
"......Nee-san, who in the world..."
"This will be the first time I have met you, Kanon-kun.
 ......I have been entrusted with the position of BEATRICE-sama\'s head furniture. My name is Ronove.
 ......I am an old friend of Genji-san\'s.
 I am also furniture, just like you.
 Although the master I serve is different."
The color of tension didn\'t disappear from Kanon\'s expression in the slightest.
......Serving under a different master, furniture could become kind, brutal, or anything else as desired.
...If he called himself furniture serving the hated BEATRICE,
 then surely he was a despicable being as well...
"*cackle*cackle*!
 It seems that I\'m completely despised.
 It\'s as though you hate everything to do with me."
BEATRICE openly sneered at Kanon\'s hate-filled face...
Then, Kanon finally observed.
BEATRICE and Kinzo were enjoying a chess game, sitting in facing reception sofas.
But Kinzo hadn\'t even quivered.
 He was holding his head with both hands, his eyes closed tight, ...as he contemplated his next move.
......No, was he in anguish...?
".........My lord........."
"I have told Kinzo two things.
 There was good news and bad news.
 ......The good news was that he would have the fortune of being reunited with me before the ritual even ends.
 The bad news was that Kinzo had been selected for the very first sacrifice of the ceremony."
"*cackle*cackle*!
 There\'s absolutely nothing I can do about it.
 Because it truly was decided by the fickle roulette."
"...L-liar.
 You just take pleasure in killing people......"
"Stop it, Kanon-kun......"
"......So, Kinzo.
 Isn\'t it about time you decided to accept your loss?
 ......*cackle*, by this, our long lasting contest is resolved, right?"
"................................."
At a glance, you couldn\'t tell the current situation on that chaotic chessboard.
...However, judging from Kinzo\'s anguish and BEATRICE\'s malicious relaxedness,
 it looked as though it was already decided...
"............It is unavoidable...
 ...Is this also entertainment?"
"It is to me too.
 ......Concluding my contest with you may bring a flood of emotions, but it has already surpassed love and hate.
 ...It was fun.
 Several decades that were not boring...!"
BEATRICE advanced her queen, and made her final move.
......It was thus...
decided.
"Checkmate.
 .........This is a final tribute from me to you.
 Without reserve,
 ...sleep."
"Heheheh,
 ......fuhahaha,
 haah
hah
hah
hah
hah
hah
hah!!"
Kinzo suddenly stood up and laughed, like an opera singer facing a full crowd and spreading his arms,
 ...as though he had succeeded in a century-long plan.
That laugh...
...spat crimson.
Crimson flames poured out from inside him,
 spitting even out of his mouth, ears, and nose, and all at once, his body was wrapped in hellfire...
But Kinzo kept laughing.
The more he laughed, the more the hellfire spewed from his entire body, and began to char him...
Those flames became a brilliant light,
 which dazzlingly shone on the various magic tools throughout the room, and made their distorted shadows dance across the walls.
...Those shadows looked like the dead in hell, in ecstasy over Kinzo as he burned...
And,
 for one who had made a contract with a witch,
 and who had reached the end of that contract,
 ...it was an extremely fitting end...
After laughing and howling in the roaring flames for some time,
 Kinzo flopped to the ground, as though he was a puppet whose strings had been cut.
Those incredible blazing flames disappeared as though they had burned up everything there was to burn,
 and afterwards, all that was left was a festering and burnt body that would make you want to avert your eyes...
".....................Horrible..."
"Hmph.
 You should talk.
 Even though you think that was a fitting way for him to die..."
"......Why have you shown yourself...?
 Do you have some business with us...?"
"Stop it, Kanon-kun.
 ......You must not provoke BEATRICE-sama."
"It appears that you have completely terrified them.
 Pu ku ku ku."
"It seems I just can\'t get along with Kanon.
 A pity, I must say I quite like him myself...?"
BEATRICE smiled broadly, or perhaps wickedly.
Kanon violently averted his gaze, obviously disturbed.
...His reaction was so different from what he had obviously intended that it made the witch and her butler laugh.
"Kanon.
 ......You stand in the presence of BEATRICE-sama.
 Carefully consider your manner of speech."
"Oh, there is no problem, Genji.
 Let him say as he likes.
 I am gracious."
"......How are you gracious...!"
"I am always gracious to those who are about to die.
 *cackle*cackle*...!"
Kanon was brought to sudden realization by that creepy laughter...
BEATRICE\'s reason for being here was not just to take Kinzo\'s life.
The first twilight required six sacrifices.
Kinzo alone wasn\'t nearly enough.
...And they had just nonchalantly come to this place...
"*cackle*cackle*cackle*!
 Don\'t worry, Kanon.
 ......You won\'t be selected as sacrifices just because you came here.
 ......It was because you were selected as sacrifices that you were called here...!"
".........What.........!"
They instinctively figured it out immediately...
Six sacrifices were required for the first twilight.
After Kinzo, how many more would you need to add up to six?
......In this mansion, the number 5 instantly made them think of the number of servants here...
"............Is that...what you desire?"
"Mmhm.
 ...Thank me, furniture.
 Your days of suffering have tonight finally come to an end.
 You should thank me, as I have come to tell you this."
".........Certainly.
 If that is your desire."
"...G-
......Genji-sama..."
Genji had agreed to the witch\'s heartless announcement in his usual manner, without raising an eyebrow.
"After the Master\'s death, BEATRICE-sama is our master.
 Answering her demand is our final duty.
 ......Shannon.
 Kanon.
 You have done well serving until today.
 That hard work is now over."
"......As I expected of you, Genji.
 As fellow furniture, I think honorably of you."
"Shannon.
 ......Do you have any objections?"
"......No."
".........I heard that George-sama gave you a ring.
 Even so, you have no regrets?"
"No.
 ......That blessing was more than furniture deserves.
 ...Just receiving the ring has already fulfilled my feelings."
Shannon had not yet reached as high of a philosophical state of mind as Genji.
 There probably really were regrets left in her heart.
 ...She probably wanted to spend a little more warm time with the person of her thoughts, George.
......But she released herself from that.
 She took a single deep breath, and from that point on, the expression she wore was blank.
"...............Very good."
"I am a little surprised that you have been able to calm yourself this much, Shannon.
 It seems that you have also come to terms with things as furniture."
"Won\'t you at least shed some bitter tears for not being able to spend a night with the man you love?
 What a boring woman."
"............
 .........This feeling cannot be understood by the likes of you, BEATRICE-sama.
 ......If you desire our lives, please accept them.
 We will solemnly carry out that duty."
"......Good.
 Well said..."
"Pu ku ku ku.
 Just the type of person BEATRICE-sama is bad with."
"Recently, this one has become quite detached.
 ...It seems that I tortured her too much last time.
 Speaking of which, didn\'t I do the same to Battler?"
"...Hmmm.
 Am I still soft?
 Or is my style of cornering them lacking?
 In any case, she\'s just no fun."
".........However, it seems that you will still entertain me, right?
 Kanooon?"
"............Kanon-kun..."
".................."
Compared to the two who had attained a philosophical state of mind, ...there was a painful anguish on Kanon\'s face.
Kanon was still far too young to accept his demise without regrets,
 after being told of it by a suddenly appearing witch...
"......Kanon.
 I detest boredom more than anything.
 And it isn\'t interesting that those other two have obediently accepted their deaths.
 ......So I don\'t want you to betray my expectations."
"............Are you trying to make me your plaything...?"
Kanon realized that he was being provoked.
...However, no matter how much anger spurred him on, his opponent was a witch.
 He was furniture.
 He had no chance of victory from the beginning.
But the witch was expecting that he would struggle in vain and writhe around,
 and was looking forward to it...
......Just thinking about that was frustrating enough to get his blood boiling.
Was disappointing the witch by refusing to resist, like the other two,
 the only way he could strike back at her...?
"Eldest of the Seven Sisters of Purgatory, Lucifer.
 Arise."
"......Lucifer the Proud, right here."
"Kanon.
 It would be too cruel to force furniture to fight a witch.
 No matter how much anger spurs you on, you could hardly hold hope in a battle you have no chance of winning.
 Of course, a battle without a chance of success would be boring for me as well."
"......So, furniture against furniture.
 Why not resolve it with a battle between furniture?
 That should be enough to allow you some hope for victory, right...?"
"..................
 ...With all due respect, BEATRICE-sama.
 Is it truly possible that I could yield to this good-for-nothing furniture?"
"As if this cute kid would have any chance in hell against me...
 Eheheheheheheheheheheheh."
".................................kh."
"Show me that you can defeat my furniture of the Seven Stakes of Purgatory.
 If you manage to come out the admirable victor,
 .........hm, let us see..."
"I will let you have free choice over the five people who will escape becoming one of the 13 sacrifices.
 I will unconditionally welcome the five people you recommend into the Golden Land.
 ...How about that?"
Kanon understood that he was being provoked.
......However, the witch\'s condition was very tempting.
The evil ritual the witch and the rest were trying to carry out was, at this point,
 not something that Kanon cared about in the slightest.
......On the contrary, it was much more important for him to survive, be invited to the Golden Land,
 ...and have his wish granted by BEATRICE there...
"You cried that you\'d had enough of being furniture, right...?
 I shall grant your desire.
 I shall give you that human body which you wanted so much that you cried yourself to sleep.
 What do you say...?
 Then you could be together with Jessica, right?
 Ooh, just perfect.
 You may include Jessica and yourself in the five you recommend for invitation to the Golden Land."
"......If you have some hesitation toward making only yourself happy,
 then you can add Shannon and her loved one, George, as well.
 If you\'re worried about duty, then you can also add Genji."
"Hoh!
 That\'s five people.
 Just enough room, Kanon.
 .........With this much of a reward, ......*cackle*cackle*cackle*!
 You won\'t let me get bored, will youuuu...?"
"......She\'s just playing with you.
 There is no need to listen to her."
"I, ......I\'m sick of this.
 Is this really what you want, Nee-san?!"
BEATRICE couldn\'t hide her evil smile at those words.
"I\'m sick of this.
 I want to be happy!
 I\'ve had enough of being furniture.
 I want to become human, ......and have normal love...!
 I want to know that...the ocean is blue, like you!"
"............How young.
 I\'m jealous."
"That\'s why I like the young ones.
 ......Genji, Shannon, stay back.
 Kanon, Lucifer, forward."
"As you command."
".............................."
"...Hehheheheheheheheheheheh.
 I don\'t like it.
 ...You know you can\'t win against BEATRICE-sama,
 but you look down on me as though you might be able to win against me...
 ......I really don\'t like it."
That was probably humiliating to Lucifer.
...But at the same time, she was also happy that she was so lucky to have this lovely prey all to herself...
".........Come, furniture of the witch.
 .........Don\'t think that you can look down on me forever...!"
"Come, now, Battler.
 It is time for another fun show!
 *cackle*cackle*!"
".........Damn.
 It\'s turned into something ridiculous again...
 Like I\'d ever accept that it\'s a magic battle...!"
"Look, look, don\'t turn your eyes away, look at it.
 Look look, look look!
 It\'s magic, it\'s furniture,
 no matter how much you try to deny me and magic,
 look look, look look look look!"
"All this bwaan bwaan, ka-shing ka-shing, right in front of your eyes, it was all for nothing, riiiight?
 Look look look look,
 stop thinking already,
 I told you magic exists!
 I told you this is fantasy!
 Don\'t close your eyes,
 look closely,
 look look look look look!!"
"Damn it, damn it damn it damn it...
 I won\'t accept witches, I won\'t accept magic...!
 But if it\'s as obvious as this, what the hell am I meant to say?!
 ...............Damn, damndamndamn!"
"Come now, don\'t turn away, look closely, alriiiight??
 Magic exists, it\'s fantasy, stop playing detective."
"I know all about it, the truth is you\'re awful at thinking about things, riiight??
 Just stop, just stoooop, *cackle*cackle*!
 Look look, obviously fantasy, obviously fantasy, kihhihihyahyahhyahhyahhyahhyahhyaaaaaahhh!!"
"Shut up shut up shut uuuuuuuuuuup...!!!
 Don\'t talk to meeeeeeee...!!"
".........This guy\'s gotten obstinate.
 ...Get down on the ground right now and apologize for being so conceited that you thought you could "at least beat me".
 If you do, I\'ll spare you, alright...?"
"I\'ll spare you from having your skin ripped off while you\'re still alive,
 and being lashed all over your body as you squirm until you die.
 Hehheheheheheheheheheheh!"
"You\'re a cute kid, so apologize...
 If you do, you can spend your last moments in blissful, wonderful ecstasy as I gently, gently finish you off......"
"Be silent, furniture of the witch.
 ...I have no intention of speaking with you."
"S-......so you say that you think nothing of me, do you...?"
"Hehhheheheheheheheheh, I don\'t like it, that disrespectful gaze of yours...
 I really don\'t like iiiiit!!"
"............Kanon-kun..............."
"..........................."
"......Isn\'t he stronger than he was against Satan?"
"That is why humans are so frightening.
 Sometimes they even become witches, and treat demons as butlers."
"Pu ku ku ku ku!
 So, which should I cheer on?"
"...Are you...
......saying that this guy\'s on par with me...!"
".........Don\'t look down on me.
 As long as you have that pride, you can never win against me."
"Y-y-
...you speak of Lucifer, the eldest of the Seven Sisters of Purgatory, and say that I can never win?!
 H-how...conceited!!"
"...Wha..............."
Kanon was desperately trying to stay alive, and he had the strong desire to become human.
But Lucifer didn\'t feel anything stronger than a slight desire to play.
......So, that reached its inevitable result.
 For the ability to yield such a result is the power of humans.
 ...The power of the heart.
"...............That\'s as far as you go.
 You can never win against me."
A glowing red trail extended straight out from Kanon\'s arm,
 ......pointing at Lucifer\'s throat, just beneath the tip of her chin...
"Wh-
......what is this...?!
 How could I...
 ......There...must be some mistake..."
As she ground her teeth in irritation, she tried to deny the reality right before her eyes.
 ...But no matter how much she believed in her own superiority, it didn\'t change the facts right before her eyes.
"Hoh.
 ...Well done, Kanon.
 Wonderful, you haven\'t made me bored.
 ......How pitiful my furniture is in comparison.
 *cackle*cackle*!"
"......Lucifer.
 You are boring Milady.
 Was this opponent really too much for you to handle...?"
"I\'m disappointed, eldest of the Seven Staaakes.
 Kuhihihihihihihihihihihi...!"
That would have seemed like nothing more than a simple rebuke to an outsider.
However, furniture serving the witch knew what kind of severe treatment was promised by that rebuke,
 and understood what had been left unsaid...
"Uuuuuuuuuuuguuhhh!!
 You......good-for-nothing FURNITUUUUUUUUUUUUURE!!!"
She howled.
 ...Abandoning her last bit of pride, she made her body explode, exposing her true form.
That form was a demon stake, which bounced and deflected off the walls all over the room...
"How could you shame me so much!!
 I\'ll kill you, kill you kill you kill you!!
 You slowpoke!
 Even though you can\'t even follow my movements anymore!!
 I won\'t play around anymore, I\'m seriously mad, I\'ll pierce your heart in one blow!!"
"I\'ll plow right through you, and make a fountain of bright-red blood reach the ceiling!!
 DIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIEEEE!!"
"Ka-Kanon-kun.........!!"
With a speed exceeding even the limits that the human eye could follow,
 Lucifer went wild, and flew at Kanon\'s heart...
Lucifer confirmed that the sweet taste she could feel was definitely Kanon\'s blood.
...But she quickly noticed.
...She hadn\'t pierced Kanon\'s heart...
"............Hoh.
 *cackle*cackle*!"
"This is why humans are frightening.
 ...Would you like some black tea?"
"I am fine for now.
 This is so interesting I don\'t need black tea...!"
"......K-
............Kanon-kun............"
"So arrogant......
 ......That\'s why you can\'t win against me......"
The floor was stained with dripping blood.
...It really was Kanon\'s blood,
 ......but it wasn\'t flowing out of his chest.
Kanon had sacrificed his own left hand to protect his heart...
Lucifer was arrogant.
Even though she had been given enough time to realize that this was an opponent capable of cornering her,
 even so, in her pride, she had believed that he was a worthless opponent.
 She had gotten careless.
......So just as she had announced, she had aimed for his chest, trying to pierce his heart.
Because she was arrogant, she hadn\'t even thought of aiming for somewhere other than the place she had announced.
...No, maybe she had thought about it a little.
...However, her pride would not allow her to aim for a different spot.
Because she was...
......Lucifer the Proud.
Kanon, withstanding the pain,
 grasped the demon stake sticking deep into his left hand strongly with his right,
 ...and pulled it out......
The sound of breaking bones and even more blood dripping down could be heard.
Shannon instinctively averted her eyes.
There was an air hole in the back of the pierced hand so big that you could clearly see through to the other side...
Kanon\'s face was filled with agony,
 ......but in this very moment,
 he had won, without a doubt.
The demon stake he was gripping with his right hand turned back into Lucifer again...
Kanon was now gripping exactly where her neck was.
".........Ga,
 ............gu,
 ..................h..."
"...I win.
 .........BEATRICE."
Kanon didn\'t hold back at all with the hand gripping Lucifer\'s throat.
......She had challenged him again after their fight had already been decided.
Kanon had no obligation to be considerate.
But even so, Kanon released the witch\'s furniture.
......Was it his naive humanism, his pity for another piece of furniture,
 or a final show of respect to the witch?
In any case, when she was released, Lucifer fell face-down on the ground,
 and made as if to vomit, moaning over the pain in her throat...
"Spectacular, Kanon.
 ......Your great efforts have gone some way to proving Kinzo\'s research correct."
Ronove was clapping his hands.
...To Kanon, who had achieved a difficult victory, incurring a wound on his left hand that couldn\'t be closed, that applause seemed nothing but shallow.
"......All possibilities are hidden in the human heart, was it?
 .........My, my, this is why humans are frightening!
 Well done, Kanon.
 You are victorious.
 Spectacular!"
"......Haah,
 ......haah,
 ......haah......"
"Are you okay?!
 Kanon-kun......"
Shannon ran up to him and wrapped a handkerchief around his left hand, which was still spraying blood.
"That was spectacular, Kanon!
 Truly spectacular.
 I was also slightly hoping for an upset.
 How truly wonderful you are as furniture not to let me down.
 *cackle*cackle*!
 I think better of you now.
 I honestly think better of you!"
"Y-......you better not have forgotten our promise...
 BEATRICE..."
"Mhm.
 Of course I have not forgotten.
 Witches and demons are admittedly unjust.
 However, we are much more noble than humans when it comes to our contracts."
"I will not go back on my word.
 I guaranteed that if you won,
 I would give you the right to decide the five people who will escape becoming the 13 sacrifices."
"......B-BEATRICE-sama.
 I haven\'t yet...lo - 
higi!!"
BEATRICE twirled her pipe, and heaven and earth turned over just for Lucifer.
......So as a horribly natural result, she "fell" onto the ceiling.
The ceiling doesn\'t seem that high to people standing on the floor.
...However, people who fall on it upside-down and head-first surely don\'t feel the same way...
"Milady.
 Isn\'t this a little much?"
"*cackle*cackle*!
 That may be so.
 I suppose I will forgive her."
BEATRICE spun her pipe again.
When she did, the magic that had been affecting Lucifer was released.
......So as a horribly natural result, this time with extreme legitimacy, she "fell" back onto the floor.
"Agah......!!"
"............Ku,
 ............u,
 ...BEATRICE-sama,
 ...f-...forgive me............"
"What are you afraid of?
 I have already forgiven you, haven\'t I?
 *cackle*!
 So, Kanon.
 Shall we continue?"
".........Continue what?
 ...You aren\'t saying that you want me to finish her, are you...?!"
"Ah, no, no.
 It isn\'t over yet, right?"
".........What isn\'t?
 ...Stop dodging the question...!!"
"I did promise you, didn\'t I?
 If you could defeat my furniture, of the Seven Stakes of Purgatory, riiiiiiight?
 Come, arise, Seven Stakes of Purgatory.
 The six younger sisters of the worthless elder sister!"
""""""Kyahhahahahahahahahahahahaha!!""""""
With shrill laughing voices, the air split,
 and gold sprayed everywhere as the remaining six of the Seven Stakes of Purgatory showed themselves...
All of the Seven Sisters of Purgatory, only one of which Kanon had been able to defeat by sacrificing his left arm, were gathered...
By now, Kanon regretted his thoughtlessness in accepting the witch\'s challenge.
...He had been foolish to assume that a game with a witch would be on an even footing......!
"............Laaame-o.
 Onee-sama, why are you crawling on the floor?"
"Y-...you people...............
gh......"
"See, this is why Onee-sama\'s useless.
 Even though she acts like she\'s so great as the oldest sister, that\'s just on the outside."
"Yeah, seriously!
 Lucifer onee-sama, your disgraceful behavior will damage others\' opinions about all of us!
 Know your shame!
 You novice!"
"............Ku, .........gu......"
"Kanon-ku~n, awesome awesome.
 But don\'t get cocky, okay?
 Lucifer onee-sama just brags all the time, she\'s no big deal compared to the rest of us sisters."
"...That\'s why I\'m always saying Lucifer-nee shouldn\'t do anything.
 It\'s alright if she just brags all the time.
 Because we superior ones always have to clean up the fighting scenes."
"What are you gonna do, Onee-sama?
 We respect your pride,
 so we were planning on letting you challenge him again in that beaten-up body without getting in the way..."
"......But Kanon-kun sure is strong, right?
 Right now, no matter how much you struggle, there\'s no way you can win, right...?"
"......Y-
.........you peopleee............"
"*cackle*cackle*!
 My, my, you sisters are always so lively.
 Is now really the time for discord?"
"Being a 7-person unit is what makes you the Seven Sisters of Purgatory.
 Now play nice and execute the task I gave you.
 Swiftly, alright?"
"Come on, Lucifer onee-sama.
 If you want to borrow the power of your little sisters...
 Say it, okay?
 We want to hear you ask us for help from your own mouth."
"Kh, ............you plan to mock me even more.........?!"
"\'I, the foolish - 
weak - 
ugly - 
shaaameful! - 
eldest sister Lucifer, beg my younger sisters to save me\'.
 ......C\'mon, let\'s hear it.
 If you let us hear that, we\'ll save you.
 That\'s a deal, right?
 Everyone?!"
"......You.........
...b-
......bitcheees......"
The Seven Sisters of Purgatory taunted their elder sister, calling her worthless.
 Verbally abusing her.
...Even Kanon, who had been fighting her for his life until a second ago, couldn\'t bear to look straight at it...
"A-as i - 
......as if I...
...could say...
...something like that......"
"Do it quickly.
 Obviously we won\'t get anywhere with you alone.
 Hurry up and slay Kanon as the Seven Sisters."
"Pu ku ku ku...
 Oh, what could be wrong, Lucifer?
 It is an order from Milady, you know?"
"............How cruel."
Lucifer ground her teeth over and over, hurled curses at her sisters, and then,
 ...............as she trembled all over,
 ......she answered her sisters\' request...
"...I, ............I, the foolish,
 ......weak,
 .........ugly...
 ...uuuu...!"
"Shaaaameful!!"
"Sh-...shameful,
 ......eldest sister Lucifer,
 ......beg...
 .........uuuuuuuughhuhu!!
 Uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa...!!"
She was finally unable to endure saying those degrading words,
 ...and the girl bearing the name of Pride broke down crying.
However, the six younger sisters kept giggling coldheartedly.
"Heyyyy!
 Don\'t try to trick us by crying!
 You haven\'t finished saying iiiit!"
"That should be enough.
 Come, sisters, let us display our power."
"I won\'t be satisfied until I hear the whole thing, you know?!
 C\'mon, c\'mon, Onee-sama, keep going!"
"That\'s enough!
 Come on, this shame has been brought upon all of us sisters!
 We won\'t let them return alive!"
"Alright, how should we play with this pitiful furniture?
 Any wonderful suggestiooons?"
"Meee, me!
 Beelze thiiinks...the seven of us shouuuld...get along and split Kanon up between us!"
"Good plan.
 ......That way all of the sisters can get along."
"Then I\'ll take the head!
 All of you can have the limbs!!"
"No no, noooooooooooo!!
 I get the heaaaad!!"
"You know there\'s no way there\'ll be any meaning to promises like that!
 It\'s obviously gonna be first one there wins!"
"Kuhihihihi!!
 Kanon-kun, if you have a suggestion for how you\'d like to be killed, just tell us, okay?
 We Seven Sisters will kill you in an awwwwesome way!"
"...........................Damn......"
"......Aaarrrrrrgggh!!
 You\'ve shamed me so much!!
 Even slicing you into eight pieces won\'t be enough!!
 I\'ll slice you into a hundred pieces!!
 Here we go, everyone!!"
""""""Yeees, Onee-sama!
 Kyahhahahahahahaha!!""""""
The seven of them burst at once.
They had no desire to play or boast.
This time, they would genuinely follow their master\'s order.
...Slay Kanon. Swiftly!
The Seven Sisters jumped around the room faster than the eye could see, deciding how they would kill Kanon.
They tortured Kanon with their cruel giggles, sometimes making a close pass at him.
...They kept scraping his arms, shoulders, and cheeks,
 carving red lines into his body...
At that time, Shannon dashed up behind him, holding on to him so that she blocked the way to his body at least a little.
" -  - Kh......!!"
"Ah......?!"
At the same time, a red cylinder wrapped around the two of them, like a beam of light sent from heaven.
 That cylinder repelled the evil ones who tormented Kanon...
"Whaaaat!!
 That\'s cheeatiiing!
 This has nothing to do with youuu!"
"Oh, I know what this is.
 She must want to play with us."
"Kyahha!
 Then I\'ll take her!
 Aaall mine!!"
"BEATRICE-sama.
 May we have Shannon as our prey...?"
"Hm?
 Aah, I don\'t mind, do as you like.
 It seems Kanon alone won\'t be enough to satisfy your gluttony."
"I am so very grateful.
 Come on, I\'ll make you regret coming out uninvited!"
"I\'ll turn you to scraps of meat so shredded you can\'t even tell who\'s who,
 mix you and mix you and mince you into hamburgers!"
"Idiot, breaking that barrier comes first!
 Do your job before you start worrying about food!"
""""Yees, Onee-sama!!""""
"Gu......uuu......!!"
As a horribly natural first action, the Seven Sisters began to destroy the barrier Shannon had created.
...Shannon\'s barrier certainly was extremely strong.
It was enough power to impress even BEATRICE.
...It was strong enough that frail furniture would turn to dust just by touching it,
 and it was firm, like a tree with deep roots.
But no matter how big a tree gets, it will eventually surrender to a saw or a hatchet.
For the Seven Sisters, "chopping down" Shannon\'s barrier, while it was a pain, was not impossible.
"Hnf......!!"
The sound, like beetles jumping around, grew even more fierce and filled the room.
They cut up and steadily eroded away that red barrier, as though with a hatchet, a saw, no, a chainsaw by now...
"............How foolish.
 You must have known that your barrier can\'t fully protect you from these girls.
 Why...?"
".........Because I can\'t just let it happen."
Shannon spoke back resolutely as she covered Kanon, who was already spent of all his energy and sprawled on the floor.
"If you hadn\'t barged in uninvited, I would have given you a sleeplike death.
 Why have you deliberately exposed yourself to the Seven Sisters?"
"......All death is not equal, you know?
 You realize an intense death tortures you even after you die?
 *cackle*cackle*cackle*!"
"............Go ahead, do as you like.
 Just like you do as you want, I have done as I wanted."
"........................
 ......Hmmmm.
 Somehow, you simply lack entertainment value recently, you know?
 The most interesting part about love is during the time when it\'s uncertain whether or not you will achieve it."
"After achieving it, a woman is like salmon who has finished laying its eggs.
 I have already tired of you."
"Thank you.
 No words I could hear from a witch would make me happier."
"......Hehehehhihihahaha.
 Then, at least in the end, show me a way of dying that will please me greatly."
"Seven Sisters, did you hear that?!
 Show me the limits of your brutality in the way you kill Shannon!!"
"...............Shannon..."
"......My apologies.
 In the end, I wasn\'t able to match up to your greatness, Genji-sama."
".........You\'re an idiot, Nee-san...
 If you\'d just left me be, ...then you might not have met this horrible..."
"No, it\'s alright.
 ...I was able to receive the ring from George-sama, and live as a woman.
 I was able to protect you, and live as a sister.
 With this, my life is settled with no regrets."
"......Nnnngggggaaaaaaaaahhhh, you\'re pissing me off.
 That philosophic view is really irritating!!
 This is why you\'re furniture you don\'t even smell like a humaaaaaan!!"
"Look at me, I am human!!
 Don\'t spout off philosophical stuff like you\'re more complete than I am, you furnituuuuuuuuuuure!!"
"............How ugly.
 Is that regret your true form?"
"It\'s not a regreeeeeet, this is called LIVING!!
 You received a ring, so it\'s alright if you die, what?!
 Aaaaah, I can\'t understand it, not a clue not a hope, goddamn astonished, goddamn shocked, no goddamn good at aaaaaaaaaaaalll!!"
"......Milady, I might suggest you are acting somewhat undignified."
"Shut up, furniture!!
 Shannooooonn, do you think I\'ll let you die easilyyyyyyyyyyy?!
 Now\'s the time to bite your tooooooongue!!"
"............How pitiful.
 If you can see yourself reflected in my eyes,
 then shudder at your own ugliness."
"Don\'t worry,
 I\'ll crush you mush you mash you up so you\'re even uglier, while you\'re still aliiiiiiiiiive!!!"
At that time, .........Genji softly entered the red barrier.
Maybe that barrier didn\'t block those without ill intent.
Then Genji...softly held Shannon from behind,
 ......and covered her eyes with his right hand.
"............Genji-sama..."
"You have done enough now...
 .........Go to sleep before me."
"............Yes.
 .........Thank you very much, Genji-sama..."
".........Mhm."
After that, Genji softly pressed his left hand against the area around her collarbone...
......As he did, from the area where that left hand pressed,
 ......a crimson stain gently spread out.
When Genji removed his hand,
 .........bright-red fresh blood oozed out of there.
For just the very first instant, it appeared to be shaped like a crimson rose...
And when he removed the right hand that covered Shannon\'s eyes,
 .........there was a peaceful expression on her face, as though she was sleeping.
......And she fell softly,
 ...silently down,
 .........and slept.
Her soul had already been sent to a world where the malicious witch and her furniture could never reach her,
 no matter how evilly they tortured her...
BEATRICE and the Seven Sisters were shocked by this scene.
...Only Ronove had a mysterious expression along with his smile.
Then Genji leaned over Kanon, who was crouching on the floor.
".........You did well.
 You, too, should sleep now."
".................................
 ............Yes.
 Thank you very much, Genji-sama."
Just as he had done with Shannon, after gently covering Kanon\'s eyes with his hand,
 Genji gently covered the area around Kanon\'s collarbone with his other hand.
......And when that was removed with the lightness of a feather,
 ...there was a crimson rose shape.
But that rose shape quickly turned into the stain of bright-red blood pouring out...
"Wh-
............what is...that......"
"......What a boring person.
 ...The fun of a balloon of life is in poking it with a needle and making it forcefully explode."
"Spectacular, Genji.
 ............You truly are furniture."
"......Thank you very much.
 ...Well then, BEATRICE-sama, Ronove-sama.
 With this as my final task, allow me to rest."
"............Grr.
 You took what I was playing with.
 All of that thrashing and mashing I wanted to do to them,
 I hope you\'re willing to take all that instead??"
BEATRICE faced him with an unsatisfied expression,
 but Ronove spoke quietly to Genji with a soothing smile.
"You have worked hard.
 You are my greatest servant.
 ......I shall bestow as a final gift to you a peaceful sleep worthy of all your labors until now."
"Wha?!
 Wait, what are you...!"
When Ronove snapped his fingers,
 ......as if Genji was a puppet that had crumpled from its strings being cut,
 ...suddenly, and yet gently...
He fell, sprawled on the floor, into a sleep that witches couldn\'t call him back from...
That was as filled with kindness as the sleep he had given Shannon and Kanon...
"......What was that, Ronove?
 ......What a boring anticlimax."
"Are you not a powerful Great Witch, Milady?
 Something such as this is not enough to pay attention to.
 ......It is not like you to allow the blood to rush to your head because of provocation from someone like Shannon."
"...........................
 ...hmph."
What was there that BEATRICE didn\'t like?
...Was she still unable to remove the thorn of Shannon\'s words?
Ronove laughed lightly, as though lamenting the complexity of the human and the female heart, and ordered the Seven Sisters to go.
......After all, there were still two sacrifices left for the first twilight.
The Seven Sisters cavorted as they disappeared...
