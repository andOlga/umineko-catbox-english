...Rosa and the rest returned from the chapel to the parlor in the mansion.
Such a horrific thing had happened so early in the morning.
Of course they were high-strung...
Battler and George - who had cried, raged, and let their emotions explode after seeing their parents\' tragic bodies - 
returned to the parlor, sat on the sofas, and let their minds go blank, as though everything up until then had been a lie...
Only Maria was completely unchanged, and looked just like normal.
......When she wasn\'t being mischievous, she was basically a kid who played wordlessly by herself,
 so even if her mind was blank, she would probably look as she did.
...But as she turned on the TV and flipped through the channels, it looked as though nothing about her had changed from normal.
Perhaps Rosa had some opinions about this attitude, which was clearly different from normal people.
......She stared at Maria\'s back with a gaze that wasn\'t quite pleasant.
Eventually, Kumasawa came to say good morning.
 ...Her cheerful manner was clearly out of place, and she couldn\'t help but be bewildered at the strange atmosphere in the room.
......Then, she heard the details from Gohda, and expressed her shock in a truly noisy manner.
"O-o-o-of course you\'ve contacted the police, right...?!
 What should we do in a time like this, oooh, what should we do...?!"
".........Please listen calmly.
 ...It seems that some kind of apparatus was done in by lightning last night.
 Because of that, we have become unable to use the telephones..."
"Huuuh?!!
 Th-then, until the typhoon passes, we can\'t even contact the police?!"
Maybe Kumasawa\'s exaggerated surprise was a little comical.
Rosa giggled, in spite of the situation.
......Because of that, the fog of confusion that had covered her head cleared up a little.
".........I\'ve got to stay strong.
 ......It\'s not just Maria.
 ......I\'m acting as a parent for George-kun and Battler-kun too now, so I have to stay strong......"
Rosa had been the youngest sibling, with a large difference in age between her and the others.
So she was always treated as a child.
Every time she learned something new, it was something obvious to her brothers and sister,
 and she had grown a complex, thinking that she must be incompetent.
So she had formed a passive attitude, asking her brothers and sister for advice every time something happened...
.........But she no longer had any brothers or sisters.
Now, Rosa was the only one of the four Ushiromiya siblings left.
...Furthermore, if Kinzo continued to shut himself away even in this extraordinary situation,
 ......Rosa would have to surpass this crisis as the representative of the head.
"...............I\'m not a child anymore, not a child.
 ................................."
...Rosa slapped her knees lightly and stood up.
She must not wait for orders now.
...She had to start moving herself.
She picked up the receiver to the extension phone on the side table.
......Then she immediately remembered that the telephones were out of order.
Genji and Shannon, who she had sent to see Kinzo, hadn\'t returned yet.
...She had a general guess.
 He was probably yelling about something nonsensical again, and they were unable to calm him.
...His important chapel had been defiled with blood.
That was easy to imagine.
She had planned on using the extension phone to call the study, but with the telephone line dead, there was nothing else for it.
Rosa decided to go to the study directly, with her own two feet.
Her old self would have been so frightened that she wouldn\'t have been able to go see Kinzo.
...And in fact, if she did meet him, she would probably be blamed for something and abused.
But now wasn\'t the time to be frightened.
 .........As his true daughter, she had to make him aware of the current situation.
"......Kumasawa-san,
 I\'m going to see Father.
 ...Take special care of George-kun and Battler-kun.
 ......I\'m sure they are on edge right now."
"Yes, yes...
 I am quite sure they must be...
 ...It is truly pitiable...
 I shall make them something warm to drink."
"Thank you."
Rosa went out into the hallway, and headed towards Kinzo\'s study.
The atmosphere in this mansion, which she had spent her younger days in and should have been full of memories, seemed somehow different...
And she began to climb the stairs in the entrance hall...
......Just then.
 In the gloom down the stairs behind Rosa, ...something glowed.
It was a single fluttering gold butterfly.
...It fluttered around and sparkled.
That butterfly quietly danced without a sound.
......Obviously.
 No one can hear the sound of a butterfly\'s wings beating.
.........And then, ......it stopped on Rosa\'s back as she slowly climbed the stairs.
Rosa didn\'t notice.
 And to an ignorant observer, it would probably have looked just as though a single sheet of gold leaf in the shape of a butterfly had gotten stuck there.
Without noticing, Rosa continued heading to Kinzo\'s study......
".........Wellll then, in what way should I entertain myself next?
 ...There are still many, many pieces left.
 ...*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*...!"
In the parlor, which had returned to silence, the only sound was that of the TV, which Maria was watching alone.
If there was anything audible other than that, it was the sound of the rain which had continued on and on since last night.
Every one of those people who had viewed that unearthly and horrible scene stayed silent, as though praying that the events of this morning were all a dream.
Only Kumasawa hadn\'t seen it, and so acted slightly differently.
...She instead found this silence difficult to bear, and was fidgety with the desire to cheer everyone up.
...However, unable to say more than she should, it seemed that she was racking her brains as to how she could be of some use...
Normally it would be time for breakfast.
 ......However, maybe because something like that had happened, Gohda seemed to have forgotten about preparing a meal.
...No, maybe everyone was so beaten up that they had forgotten their hunger.
Kumasawa wanted to bring up the subject of what they would do for breakfast, but it didn\'t seem like the right atmosphere, so she really couldn\'t.
But it was difficult being hungry.
...So, she casually made a proposal.
"...I imagine you all must be tired after all that has happened.
 ......In times like this, I think the best thing is to heat yourself with some warm black tea."
"......Mm, that is a good plan.
 I agree as well."
"Hoh-hoh-ho.
 How about some delicious black tea with biscuits and jam?
 Oh yes, yes, it seems that it\'s near Halloween - there were some delicious-looking pumpkin-shaped cookies on the shelf..."
"......Ah, Kumasawa-san, that\'s........."
Of course, she had said the wrong thing.
 ...Because she had reminded Battler and the rest about that horrible and tragic Halloween party in the chapel...
Nanjo hurriedly whispered into Kumasawa\'s ear.
".........................................."
"......Battler-san, I am truly sorry!
 ...I didn\'t mean anything bad, gracious, no..."
"No, don\'t worry about it.
 .........I\'ll definitely turn this boiling anger back on the culprit."
".........I wonder if that culprit is still on the island."
"Probably.
 After all, there\'s not gonna be a boat coming until the typhoon passes."
"Ye-...yes, my goodness!
 Because the boats don\'t come even if there is a little wind.
 They certainly wouldn\'t be able to ride one during a typhoon, good gracious no!"
"......It creeps me out."
"You think so too, Aniki?
 Me too.
 .........Regardless of whether the culprit was that mystery guest or not."
"That\'s right.
 ......We are naturally suspecting the mysterious guest who calls herself BEATRICE,
 but we still cannot be sure that she is the culprit.
 ...There is still the possibility she\'s a victim whose corpse still hasn\'t been found."
"......When I think of it that way, there\'s something I just can\'t understand."
"What do you......mean by that......?"
"It\'s simple.
 It\'s just like Kumasawa baa-chan said a short while ago.
 Right now, this island is right in the midst of the typhoon, and escape is impossible.
 The same thing goes for the culprit.
 .........In that case, having the crime come to light should have been the thing that the culprit most wanted to avoid."
"......That\'s right.
 ...There was no need to draw that creepy magic circle on the entrance to the chapel, and show off the fact that the corpses were there."
"Right, exactly that.
 Furthermore, if they were able to take the time and effort to do something so horrible to those six,
 ......it should have been equally possible for them to hide the six corpses where they would be impossible to find."
"I agree. That brutal Halloween party probably wasn\'t directed at those who died.
 ......It was directed at the people who would eventually discover it: us.
 You could probably claim that the magic circle was there to show it to us."
"...The culprit knew that they wouldn\'t be able to get away from this island for a while.
 ......And yet, they acted as though they wanted to make us find the corpses in the middle of this typhoon."
"......What...does this mean?
 ...If I was the culprit, I definitely wouldn\'t play around and make us find the corpses."
"............BEATRICE-sama was not in her room.
 ...The room did not seem particularly disturbed.
 ......Ah, no, Milady did disturb it quite a lot though..."
"...Come to think of it, what happened to Jessica?"
"Kanon-san is looking after her.
 ...They are probably in Milady\'s room."
"............That isn\'t good.
 ...The culprit is definitely still on the island.
 ......In this situation, I don\'t believe it\'s a very good idea to isolate ourselves in small numbers."
"Wh-what do you mean by that...?
 Y-y-you don\'t mean to say that the culprit plans to kill all of us...?!
 Awawawawawawawawa..."
"Let us remain calm...
 That is not yet certain..."
"But we can\'t deny the possibility, much to my chagrin. Ihihi."
"......This letter was in the chapel.
 According to this, the culprit is the witch,
 and if we don\'t solve the riddle of Grandfather\'s epitaph and find the gold, she\'ll massacre the whole family...or something like that."
"Is that true...!
 Umm, would you allow me to read it as well...?"
"Hii...hi...hi...hieeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee...eeeeeeeeee...hh..."
"......mmmmmmmgh......"
As they read the witch\'s letter, Gohda, Kumasawa, and Nanjo\'s faces grew even paler than they had been...
Kumasawa could no longer hide her shaking.
".........If you don\'t want to die, try finding Grandfather\'s hidden gold, huh.
 ...Screwing around with us.
 I\'ll bet you can\'t solve the riddle, so you\'re trying to make us solve it...!"
"However, ...I wonder what the truth is.
 Madam always insisted that the Legend of the Gold was nothing more than a fantasy created by the Master.
 ......It is doubtful whether that actually existed..."
"True...
 Supposedly, they thought it would be nice if it existed, but only somewhat believed it.
 ......The relatives only all started believing in the Legend of the Gold after Kinzo\'s health worsened and the inheritance problem came up.
 I would think that there were very few people who believed it before then."
"...Really? I wonder if that\'s why.
 Do you remember?
 On the table in the chapel.
 ...There were three gold ingots.
 That alone is worth quite a lot.
 Couldn\'t that truly prove that the Legend of the Gold was real?"
"E-...excuse me, ...please wait.
 Just now, did you say three gold bars......?"
"......Yeah, there were definitely three of them piled up.
 So what?"
"Well, umm, I, .........happened to hear Krauss-sama talking about it once.
 ......Yes, I just heard it, you understand?!
 It\'s not like I was trying to listen to his discussions in secret, gracious no!"
"Don\'t worry about that now.
 So then what?
 Is there something wrong with there being three of those gold bars?"
"...Y-yes.
 According to Krauss-sama, ...there was only one bar ever found to support the Legend of the Gold."
"......That is correct.
 I do believe the story goes that Kinzo-san showed the president of Marusoo a mountain of gold, and let him take one bar back with him."
"And that one came to be in Krauss-sama\'s possession.
 And he said this as well.
 That there was no gold which supported the Master\'s legend besides that one..."
"You\'re talking about my uncle here, right?
 So what have we got here?
 ......No wait, ......three?!
 Wait, wait, where did they come from, that\'s too many of them!"
"Might we not think of it this way?
 Maybe the other people in the family each found one, and they each brought one of them there..."
"No, I cannot believe that.
 When all of the relatives came to the mansion, I was entrusted with their luggage.
 I did not feel any suspicious weight back then."
"......I think they weighed about ten kilograms.
 If that much weight was in their bags, even I would notice.
 But it didn\'t seem that way."
"Same here.
 At the most, there were some changes of clothes, medicine, Kyrie-san\'s makeup.
 That\'s about it, I think.
 Auntie Rosa\'s luggage also looked pretty light."
"......In that case, those three piled up gold bars were being shown to them, ...or maybe us.
 ......Telling us that the Legend of the Gold is definitely real.
 That it isn\'t a fantasy.
 And challenging us to uncover it."
"Could there be a scheme...to have us solve the epitaph which points to the hidden location, and then try to snatch it away?"
"............That does fit best.
 ...But there are a few parts that don\'t make sense.
 First, our parents, who should have been the most likely to be able to solve the epitaph, were killed first.
 I think that creates an immediate contradiction."
".........And something else makes even less sense.
 ......They\'re trying to say that the Legend of the Gold is actually true,
 but how could they prepare that gold?
 ......It\'s almost like the culprit has already found the gold,
 and is telling us to try and find it too."
"Maybe the culprit obtained those three like Uncle Krauss and thereby became certain about the Legend of the Gold,
 and is trying to make us search for the rest... I think that way is the most convincing."
"...........................
 ......The pieces on the chessboard aren\'t lining up at all.
 ............We don\'t have a clue what the culprit is planning, what they want, what they want to make us do.
 ............Is it pointless?
 Thinking about anything, at this point in time.
 ..........................."
"......Kihihi.
 It was written down.
 What she wants you to do.
 Can\'t any of you read? Kihihihihihihihihihi."
Maria suddenly laughed in a creepy voice.
...I\'d thought she\'d been concentrating on the TV, but she\'d been listening in too, apparently.
As she remained facing the TV, ...she very simply told us what we were forgetting.
"BEATRICE hasn\'t said one word about wanting the gold.
 ......She\'s not asked anything except whether you can solve the epitaph\'s riddle or not."
"...Although I bet she thinks it\'ll be impossible for you anyway.
 ......Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi."
"......So you\'re saying you can solve it, Maria?"
"...Don\'t caaare.
 She\'s going to take me to the Golden Land, so.
 Won\'t get in BEATRICE\'s way.
 Kihihihihihihihihihihi,
 ouch."
"Looks like if we wanna understand further, we\'re gonna have to ask Maria.
 ...Maria, tell us.
 ...............Who is this BEATRICE?
 What is she planning?"
"Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi!
 Well, you see, BEATRICE is a witch!
 She can do anything with her wondrous powers."
"Anything can be done with the power of magic.
 You can create gold, you can create bread.
 And of course, you can even create sweets!
 You saw it, didn\'t you?
 Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi!"
"......hn?"
At that time, everyone jumped at the sound of a door being closed forcefully.
We turned around to find that at some point Rosa had returned, bringing Genji and Shannon.
......Then she rapidly approached Maria, her heels clacking, and hit her sharply on the cheek.
"......Stop talking about that.
 Battler-kun and the rest will take it badly."
"..................Uu..."
Without waiting for a response, she slapped Maria\'s cheek once more.
Everyone could only stand there, shocked.
"I don\'t know what "uu" means.
 What about yes?"
"...............Uu."
She mercilessly slapped Maria\'s cheek again.
......Maybe she didn\'t feel like resisting after being hit twice.
Maria weakly said yes.
"Ro-......Rosa-san, there was no reason to do something so harsh..."
"...This is my daughter\'s education.
 I would greatly appreciate it if you didn\'t interject."
The atmosphere around Rosa, with Genji and Shannon in tow, was somehow cold, and yet dignified,
 ...completely different from how she seemed before she left.
We saw that Auntie Rosa was holding something that looked like a gun.
......I couldn\'t imagine that she would have brought back a toy in this situation.
"Auntie Rosa, what is...?"
"......This is Father\'s.
 Because of the current situation, I borrowed it specially.
 .........I\'m sure you all realize as well as I do.
 The culprit is still nearby.
 We don\'t know what could happen."
"...............I agree.
 ......Rather than trying to figure out what the culprit is planning, it might be better to first think about our own safety."
"..........................."
"Father was alright, but he was slightly agitated by these sudden events.
 ...Fortunately, he said that he won\'t leave his room, so he\'s probably safe.
 Now, we should do all we can to gather in the same place."
"...I agree.
 We don\'t even know where the culprit is hiding, ......and anyway, there\'s no proof that there\'s only one of them.
 ..............."
I shivered at the words that had come out of my own mouth.
That\'s right.
 Could a single person kill six people and create such a horrible scene all alone?
......Isn\'t it natural to assume that this crime was carried out by multiple culprits?
"......I agree with Rosa-san.
 It is probably good for us to gather in one place."
"My goodness, yes, I also think that is good, yes, yes!"
".........Maybe it would be good to call Milady and Kanon-san here already."
"Good idea.
 ......Let\'s have them come down."
George-aniki made to grab the extension phone, but Gohda-san shook his head.
......Oh, right, we can\'t use the phones right now.
"......I\'ll go with a couple people.
 If George-aniki and Gohda-san come as well, that should be enough."
"............No.
 Let\'s all go together.
 ...It\'s a "Wolves and Sheep Puzzle".
 If we\'re all gathered together here in equilibrium, that situation is the most safe."
"...\'Wolves and Sheep Puzzle\'?"
"......Uu.
 I have it.
 Show you."
"Maria, turn off the television.
 ......Genji-san.
 Please tell me where Jessica-chan\'s room is.
 Let\'s all go together."
"......Yes.
 I will guide you."
"Come on, everyone.
 We\'ll move together.
 Follow my instructions."
We stood up.
 Maria alone looked like she had some lingering attachment to the TV, but she went along with everyone for now, and got up.
"...Shannon, thank goodness.
 I was a little worried when you took so long to get back."
"I am sorry to have worried you.
 The Master ordered me to copy down something..."
"Copy down?"
"............Shannon."
"I, .........I am sorry, excuse me..."
We headed for Jessica\'s room, led by Genji-san, and Auntie Rosa, holding the gun.
Jessica and Kanon-kun are a girl and boy of about the same age.
 That\'d sure be a shame if we walked in on them at a bad tiiime, is what I\'d have joked about normally, I\'m sure.
However, Auntie Rosa was on edge, constantly exuding tension.
 ...So it really wasn\'t the kind of atmosphere where I could joke like that.
"Hey, don\'t fall behind!!
 Everyone move together!
 We don\'t know when or where the culprit might leap out at us, you know?!"
...No, maybe Auntie Rosa\'s attitude was more appropriate.
......Since Grandfather hadn\'t come down, Auntie Rosa was the leader.
This wasn\'t a situation where she could smile like she always did.
......And Auntie Rosa was herself a mother.
 She probably also thought that, if she didn\'t get ahold of herself, some harm might befall her beloved daughter.
The culprit had killed six of our parents at once.
......The method they had used was unknown, but there was a good chance that this opponent could take down a large number of people in an instant.
Was that with weapons, or with numbers?
......Or was it the magic of a witch?
In any case, it definitely didn\'t look like there were any factors indicating we could get careless...
The rest of us should also take much, much greater care, like Auntie Rosa...
"............Everyone, stop!"
Auntie Rosa spoke in a sharp voice.
When we peered forwards, wondering what was up...
......we immediately noticed the reason...
".........Wh-......what is this......"
"Hii...............!"
"Everyone, get back...!"
Gohda-san and Genji-san approached the door...
Jessica\'s room was probably on the other side of that door.
"This......seems to be the same paint that was scribbled on the door to the chapel."
"......It appears so.
 It appears that not much time has passed since it was drawn."
"What is that......
 ......Another...magic circle?!"
"......It\'s the first magic circle of the moon.
 ...It has the power to open unopenable doors."
The door to Jessica\'s room......had that creepy graffiti on it which had been drawn on the door to the chapel.
......That strange shape definitely had some meaning related to the occult.
But it didn\'t matter what that meaning was.
We were more worried about whether those two were alright.
"Tha-that doesn\'t matter!
 Are Jessica-chan and Kanon-kun alright?!"
"...I have a bad premonition...
 We should quickly take those two downstairs."
"Milady!
 Milady!!
 Are you there?
 Please answer!!"
Gohda-san knocked violently and yelled, ...but there was no answer.
He twisted the doorknob with a clatter, but the lock just resisted him.
"......Rosa-sama, it seems to be locked."
"There are no other options.
 Please open it."
Genji nodded, and Gohda quickly unlocked the door with the master key.
...In the back of my mind, horrible images floated up and disappeared, one after another.
......A magic circle had been drawn on the door to the chapel.
And six corpses had been behind that.
......So, if there was a magic circle drawn on the door to Jessica\'s room, ......then beyond it............
"Je-............Jessica-sama!!"
"Wh-what happened?
 Is she there?!"
"Jessica!!
 What happened?!!"
......It was truly heartless.
...The expression on Gohda-san\'s face and what he said when he opened the door...
prepared us for the brutal fate that Jessica might have met, even without seeing her...
Everyone tumbled into Jessica\'s room at once.
...That scene told everyone that their worst fears were right on the mark...
"...Jessicaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!"
".........Oh......my......
 ...Doc-...Doctor Nanjo!!"
The room seemed elegant for Jessica\'s age, and there she was inside it, lying on the ground.
There was a large pool of blood on the floor.
......And there was a knife or something sticking deep into her back......
...Was it a knife?
 There was a design in the handle that had to have been done in a devil motif.
There was no doubt that this weapon(?) carried some kind of occult meaning.
"...This is.........horrible.
 ...She has passed away.
 ......This...probably...reaches her lungs...
 ......Not much time has passed since she died."
"Jessicaaaaaaaaaaaa!!
 Damn it, damn iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit!!"
"......B-Battler-sama......"
"I was naive!!
 I knew it!!
 Since they couldn\'t escape the island, the culprit was definitely close by!
 Then why wasn\'t I on my guard straight away!!
 ......I was naive!!
 I just assumed that culprits sneak away after they commit a crime!"
"......We were stunned then.
 We thought we just had to accept it when Jessica-chan gave in to rage and ran off.
 ......But we were naive.
 We should have stopped her...!"
"...Gohda-san, why did you leave those two alone?!
 If only you had been with them, something like this would never...!!"
"N-no, you, you see, I...!!
 I said it was dangerous so we should return!
 It\'s just that...Milady said that she wanted to be alone!
 Kanon-san told me to leave it to him, and...!"
"......Speaking of which, where is Kanon-san...?!"
"That\'s right!
 What in the world happened to Kanon-kun?!"
"K-......Kanon-kun...
 Where........."
"Kanon-san should have been with Milady...
 Where in the world...!"
"You don\'t think...they got him...?!"
".......................................
 Quiet.
 .........Someone might be hiding in this room.
 Search under the bed and in the closet!"
There was also a chance that Kanon-kun\'s corpse had been pushed away somewhere.
At Rosa-san\'s order, everyone searched the room together.
......But there wasn\'t a single human hiding anywhere.
"......He\'s nowhere!!
 Could the culprit have taken him out of the room?!
 Then we have to search for him quickly and save him!
 ......If we\'re slow, something awful might happen!!"
"Auntie Rosa, let\'s search all over the mansion!
 Let\'s search for the culprit!
 Let\'s save Kanon-kun!!"
"........................
 ............Quiet!!!"
Auntie Rosa yelled at us loudly, and we fell instantly silent.
She was probably contemplating something.
...But what in the world could that be......?
...Auntie Rosa walked around the room as though looking for something, ...or as though she was collecting her thoughts.
............Then, she found something on the side table by the bed, and picked it up.
"...............If anyone knows, tell me.
 ......What key is this?"
Auntie Rosa showed everyone a key with a cute mascot attached to it.
...Judging from its cute appearance, I didn\'t doubt that it was Jessica\'s key, but I had no way of knowing what key it was.
"......It is probably the key to this - to Milady\'s room."
After hearing that, Auntie Rosa made a point of going outside the door and checking.
.........Without a doubt, it was the key to this room.
"............I wonder why it was set in a place like this.
 Normally, don\'t you keep important keys in your pocket?"
"...Umm, ............Milady wasn\'t in the habit of locking her room.
 Except for when she went to school - 
it seems she would do it then, because she didn\'t want Krauss-sama to look inside her room..."
".........I see.
 She wasn\'t at school, so it\'s natural that Jessica-chan would set the key down here.
 How many keys can open this door?"
"Ju-...just the one Milady had..."
"Can\'t it be opened with your master keys?"
"......They can open it."
"How many master keys are there?
 Do all of the servants have one?
 Are there extras?"
"Yes.
 We all have one.
 .........As for extras, ...I wonder."
"There used to be several, ...but Madam strongly scolded us that this was careless, so I believe they have been dealt with."
"......That is correct.
 There is only one held by each servant.
 There are no more."
"...nn?
 Wait a second.
 ...In the last game, I thought we said there were extra master keys?"
"Yes.
 Regarding that.
 I have noticed that having several master keys whose locations are unknown is quite disadvantageous for me."
"......Well, yeah.
 Since you want to make me believe in magic by using locked rooms, it must be really disadvantageous for you to have master keys unaccounted for."
"...In fact, every time a trick related to locks showed up,
 I was planning to resist by arguing that the culprit possessed a master key that someone had lost in the past, or a duplicate."
"Yes, exactly.
 So I\'ve decided to make a move to defeat that.
 ......I\'ll alter the setup."
"
The only master keys are the ones held by the servants, one key each
.
 *cackle*cackle*."
"...Messing with me.
 ......More importantly.
 What is this move?
 ......What\'s Auntie Rosa saying?"
"*cackle*cackle*.
 Who knows?
 You should try listening in."
"...............Thank you.
 I have the situation sorted out."
"......And I\'ve managed to identify the culprit who assaulted Jessica-chan, or maybe one of their accomplices."
"Wha-what did you say...?!
 Who is that?!"
"...Auntie Rosa, you can\'t be talking about Kanon-kun...?"
"......Huh, ......huuuh?!
 Wh-why Kanon-kun?!"
"This room was locked.
 And the only keys that can unlock this room are the master keys that each servant is holding, as well as the key Jessica had."
"......But Jessica-chan\'s key was closed up in here.
 ...Which means the only keys that could have locked it are the master keys."
"............It is as you say."
"In that case, someone killed Jessica-chan, then locked the door!
 That person was holding a master key.
 And there are only five people who were holding master keys!"
"Oh, oh my!!
 It wasn\'t me, not me!
 Gracious, no, I couldn\'t do something like that!"
"......Kumasawa-san, you got up late.
 After we returned from the chapel to the parlor, we did meet you there,
 but it\'s impossible to prove where you were and what you were doing until that time."
"You watched us from the shadows, chased after Jessica-chan and Kanon-kun when they were isolated, and stealthily attacked them."
"A-are you saying that I visited Milady\'s room,
 and did something so horrible?!
 I, I, I did no such thing!
 Gracious no, no such thing!!"
"What about you, Gohda-san?
 You said that you left Jessica-chan in Kanon-kun\'s care and returned."
"...But I wonder if that\'s true?
 ......I wonder if you didn\'t really kill the two of them, hide Kanon-kun\'s corpse,
 and then come back with an innocent look on your face?!"
"Nothing of the sort happened!
 I swear on my name that I did not do anything like that!!"
"......It, it wasn\'t us, either...!!
 We were following the Master\'s orders and - "
"Yes.
 At least you and Genji-san are alright.
 That is backed up by what I heard from Father.
 The two of you were in Father\'s room the whole time, one copying and one standing witness.
 Father and I can guarantee that."
".........Thank you very much."
"In that case, I think the argument becomes who is more suspicious, Gohda-san or Kumasawa-san.
 ......That\'s how I thought, too, at least in the first moments after entering this room."
".........But then, I thought it was strange.
 Look at the state of Jessica-chan\'s body.
 Don\'t you all think it\'s strange?"
"......Strange, ...you say...?"
"Jessica-chan was stabbed in the back.
 .........Come on, it\'s often generally said, right?
 That in crimes where the victim is stabbed in the back, there\'s a high likelihood that the culprit was someone whose face was known to the victim.
 She definitely wouldn\'t invite a person that she doesn\'t trust into her room, and defenselessly expose her back."
"Ro-......Rosa-sama, you couldn\'t mean...
.........to say that was Kanon-kun...?"
"Yes.
 We know well what state Jessica-chan was in right before she was killed."
"......Jessica-chan was very panicked after seeing her parents\' tragic bodies.
 And it\'s easy to imagine that after she regained her composure, she\'d have been in a horrible slump."
"......I can really understand it if Jessica-chan\'s frame of mind led her to shut herself up alone in her room.
 And those particulars would also fit with Gohda-san\'s story."
"......Jessica-chan said to leave her alone.
 ...Then Kanon-kun, who is of a similar age, and may have had some adolescent relationship with her, said to leave it to him.
 I can really understand why he\'d feel that way."
".........And I think that is the very reason why Jessica-chan welcomed Kanon-kun into her room."
"But what if it had been Gohda-san or Kumasawa-san?
 Would she have let them into her room?"
"......I, I believe that I have gained Milady\'s trust.
 But even so, err..."
"Then you are another suspect after all, right, Gohda-san?
 I thought that you probably weren\'t liked by Jessica-chan, so I believed she wouldn\'t have let you into her room."
"So I thought it was impossible that you were the culprit, but...?"
"No, umm...!
 .........I am afraid to say that I may not have been accepted by Milady.
 ...K-Kumasawa-san, what about you?"
"Ho, hohohohohoho!
 A senior like me is far too separated by age to understand the feelings of a young person like Milady very well...
 And perhaps Milady did not open her heart up to me.
 Right, Gohda-san?!"
"Yes, that\'s right!
 She probably did not open her heart to us to a great degree!
 It would be inconceivable that Milady would let us into her room when she was heartbroken!"
Gohda-san and Kumasawa baa-chan each clasped their hands together, affirming each other with forced smiles on their faces.
It was a really unpleasant routine.
"Someone who would be permitted to enter Jessica-chan\'s room when she was heartbroken.
 Who would have been given access to her defenseless back.
 And that person had a master key.
 That only points to one person.
 ......It was impossible for anyone except Kanon-kun."
"Ple-......please, wait...!
 Kanon-kun definitely wouldn\'t do something like...!"
"Oh, then, is there someone else?
 Is Gohda-san or Kumasawa-san suspicious after all?
 Which of the two do you think is more suspicious, Shannon-chan...? Come on."
"I, ......I, ...don\'t............"
"It wasn\'t me, Shannon-san!
 Gracious, no, it was not me!"
"Of course, it wasn\'t me either!
 It was Kanon-san who had a close relationship with Milady, and you, Shannon-san, if anyone!"
".........Oh yes, I almost forgot.
 ......Jessica-chan might also have let Shannon-chan into her room."
"But you should have been with Father.
 .........But in reality,
 ......are you the culprit...............?"
"Sha-......Shannon can\'t be the culprit!
 You only just said that she was doing some important work with Grandfather!"
"Yes, I know that.
 Neither Shannon-chan nor Genji-san is the culprit.
 Even Father acknowledges that they were together the whole time.
 .........Well then, what do you think, everyone...?"
Asked that, no one could respond...
Because even if someone did argue back, they would then have to offer the name of a different suspicious person.
......And no matter whose name that was, that person was here.
...No one could do something like that.
Auntie Rosa glanced at everyone in turn, fingering the gun like it was a toy...
.........She seemed so different from the normal, kind Auntie Rosa.
...No, it\'s probably because I still don\'t feel how much danger we\'re in.
...Maybe until Auntie Rosa\'s attitude seemed natural to me, I wasn\'t fully appreciating the danger...
"Looks like no one has an opinion.
 Then I will say mine."
"Of course, I can\'t deny the possibility that Kanon-kun is a victim without a corpse.
 But until we find his corpse, I also definitely can\'t deny the possibility that Kanon-kun is a suspect."
"......There\'s a chance that Kanon-kun may claim to have been attacked by the culprit and confined somewhere...
 He may appear unexpectedly with that excuse."
"But take care.
 Maybe, probably - no, definitely.
 .........Kanon-kun killed Jessica-chan."
"............No, ..................no way........."
"I, ...I can\'t believe it...
 For Kanon-kun to do that...
......to Milady,
 ......that\'s too much to accept!!"
"I feel the same as Shannon.
 I oppose labeling Kanon-kun as the culprit."
"Then is the culprit Gohda-san or is it Kumasawa-san?
 Tell me who\'s more suspicious."
""I-i-i-it wasn\'t us!!""
"If it wasn\'t Kanon-kun, then who could have locked this door?
 Shannon-chan.
 George-kun.
 ......Well?
 Well, well, well...?"
Auntie Rosa closed in on Shannon-chan and George-aniki, laughing unpleasantly.
...Of course, they couldn\'t say anything back.
They wanted to believe in Kanon-kun.
 ...But if they did, they would have to suspect the other servants.
The simplest culprit was the mystery guest BEATRICE.
......But she was nothing more than a guest, and didn\'t have a master key.
.........Then if BEATRICE was the culprit without a master key...
...Do we have to accept the argument that she really is a witch, and locked the door with the power of magic......?
"............That\'s a filthy argument...
 ......Filthy...... Filthy......"
"What\'s so difficult?
 Make it my fault.
 You can just make it the fault of the 19th person, the mystery guest, can you not?
 If you do, you won\'t have to watch this ugly battle of humans pressing each other...
 *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!"
"So then what.
 The culprit is the 19th person, the guest BEATRICE.
 ...She\'s a witch, so she could lock the door without a key using magic."
"Are you telling me to accept that?
 No goddamn way...!
 ...No way, no goddamn way...!!"
"......*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*.
 In the last game, I learned all of your weak points.
 So, what now, what now...?
 You said you\'re never going to accept me, did you not?
 In that case, .........you can use Kanon as a perfect sacrifice."
"Kanon killed Jessica!
 If you support Rosa\'s theory, everything is settled here, you know?
 Kanon is already dead.
 There should be no need to show concern for the dead.
 And you won\'t have to doubt anyone here!
 *cackle*hahahahahahahahahahaha!"
"Damn it!!
 I won\'t accept you!!!
 But......Kanon-kun being the culprit, ......that\'s impossible!!"
"..........I don\'t want to suspect anyone.
 ...However, it is sometimes the case that the suspicious are the guilty.
 ......In any case, there is probably nothing better than caution..."
"Doc-...Doctor Nanjo...
 What do you mean by that...?"
"...Umm, please do not misunderstand.
 ...I do not wish to label Kanon-san as the culprit.
 ......However, until we understand the situation, there is the possibility that Kanon-san is the culprit,
 and I believe keeping that in mind is safer."
"Ho, ......hoh-hoh-ho...
 Yes, that\'s right... You cannot be too cautious."
It didn\'t seem as though anyone blamed Nanjo.
In reality, no one thought that Kanon was the culprit.
...But if they didn\'t suspect him, they would have to suspect one of the servants here.
......We didn\'t want to do that.
We didn\'t want to suspect.
We didn\'t want to be suspected.
"That is the correct way to think.
 ......We cannot be too vigilant.
 Is there anyone who objects to that?"
"Listen.
 ...There is a very high likelihood that this murder case is related to the legend of Father\'s gold.
 In that case, it\'s certainly the crime of someone plotting to keep a vast amount of gold worth tens of billions of yen all for themselves."
"......With that amount of money, you could play around for the rest of your life in any country.
 ...It may be possible that they would massacre us for this reason."
".............................."
"For the simple reason that our guest wasn\'t holding a master key, for the murder of Jessica-chan, and this murder alone,
 we removed our 19th person - BEATRICE - from suspicion.
 But we can\'t say that she is unrelated to the crime."
"......After all, it\'s a vast amount of gold we\'re talking about.
 We can\'t deny the possibility that there are multiple culprits.
 ......Right now, one of the people here among us might have been bought by the culprit!!"
As Auntie Rosa yelled, she looked all around, her gun still raised.
......Don\'t believe anyone, suspect the person next to you - that\'s what she was saying.
But no one wanted to suspect.
...They didn\'t want to suspect anyone here.
That weakness in their hearts demanded an answer from those not here...
"There are only two groups of people you can be sure aren\'t suspects.
 .........Yourself, and those who are already corpses.
 .........The same goes for Kanon-kun."
"Until we catch sight of his corpse, he is the most likely suspect in Jessica-chan\'s murder!!
 So take care.
 Even if he\'s still alive, even if he smooths things over with some explanation, you absolutely must not trust him!
 Alright?!"
No one gave a answer of their own initiative.
 ......However, those who met Auntie Rosa\'s eyes had to nod their heads...
Humans are social beings.
......In other words, from the time they are born, trusting each other is imprinted in their genes.
...It is unpleasant to go against that.
They definitely don\'t want to suspect anyone.
...But if they had to suspect someone,
 ...they thought that choosing one of the people not here right now would be the most acceptable.
For just the reason of acceptability, they had passively chosen to sacrifice Kanon.
This is ridiculous.........
I definitely don\'t want to believe that Kanon-kun is the culprit!
I\'d only just heard it from George-aniki, but not only were those two close in age,
 they also had that adolescent relationship Auntie Rosa had mentioned.
......It may be a little late now, but yes, they really did have that kind of air about them.
After seeing her parents\' tragic bodies, Jessica, bearing deep wounds in her heart, would only have trusted Kanon-kun.
...That\'s a very conceivable story.
So I don\'t like it...!!
Kanon-kun was the only one she trusted.
So she wouldn\'t have let anyone but Kanon-kun in.
So he was the only one who could have killed Jessica. ......I just can\'t accept that line of argument......!!!
"...Understand?!
 Even if Kanon-kun appears, don\'t get careless!
 As long as we cannot prove Kanon-kun\'s innocence, we will suppose that Kanon-kun is the culprit who killed Jessica-chan!!"
Auntie Rosa made that claim.
 By using the ever-so-slightly vague word "suppose", ...ultimately, she gave everyone that last little push they needed.
Everyone nodded weakly,
 ...............and, under the excuse that they were just temporarily supposing it,
 .........they concluded that Kanon was the culprit who had killed Jessica...
.........I wonder what the dead Jessica and Kanon would think if they could hear this exchange.
Jessica...was crying.
......She was crying in the chest of the person who had put his life on the line to fight for her: Kanon.
It was frustrating.
So frustrating that it felt like her chest would explode...
She grieved and resented how far the dignity of the dead had been trampled...
"...Those guys, ...why are they treating you like the culprit?!!"
"........................Because there\'s...no corpse."
"Why are they treating you like the culprit because there\'s no corpse?!
 You risked your life to fight for me...!"
"Then, ......that witch erased your corpse for fun......!
 To call you the culprit because of that, it\'s horrible, it\'s too horrible!!"
".........It\'s alright.
 ......In the end, I couldn\'t completely protect you, but...
 .........I was able to be of use to you, Milady..."
"So......why doesn\'t everyone understand that?!
 Stop it, Auntie Rosa!!
 Don\'t call Kanon-kun the culprit with that messed up reasoning!!"
".........She isn\'t saying that I\'m the culprit.
 ...She\'s just saying I\'m suspicious,
 ......no,
 ......she\'s saying to be careful."
"She is saying it!!
 These people are saying you\'re the culprit, Kanon-kun, so they can stop thinking!
 They aren\'t gonna think about who the culprit who killed me is anymore!!
 They aren\'t gonna think of the possibility that you aren\'t the culprit!!"
"And after this, every time something happens, they\'ll repeat the excuse that it was the work of Kanon-kun who\'s gone missing!!
 ......I can\'t stand that!!"
"...............It\'s alright.
 ...At least you know the truth, Milady."
"If only I know the truth, that\'s pointless!!
 I found out by dying.
 Truth belongs to living humans!!
 If the truth doesn\'t remain, the dead won\'t be rewarded!!
 They won\'t know why you risked your life!!"
"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*, hahahahahahahahahahahaha!
 Truly a splendid sight.
 It is a rare honey that is sweeter than the laments of the dead."
"Lament, lament.
 No matter how much you lament, the voices of the dead never reach the living."
"Damn it, damn iiiiiiit!!"
"It doesn\'t matter who!!
 Hear my voice!!
 Kanon-kun isn\'t the culprit!!
 Kanon-kun\'s corpse was just erased!
 Why, why don\'t you understand that?!!"
".........Milady."
"......I can\'t take this!!
 It\'s so sad!
 It\'s so frustrating!!"
"If it\'s like this, ......you died for nothing!!
 The dead have no honor unless the living acknowledge it!
 It doesn\'t matter who!
 Realize!!
 Realize!! Please!!
 Kanon-kun isn\'t the culprit!!"
"Aaaaaaaaaaaaaahh, don\'t go, don\'t go, guys!!
 Please, don\'t end it like this......!
 Don\'t go, ......don\'t goooooooooooooo!!!"
Rosa proclaimed that this room should be sealed until the police came.
...The rest didn\'t want to suspect each other, so they happily accepted that.
......They accepted Kanon as the tentative culprit.
...Without even imagining how much disgrace that gave to the dead, they accepted it.
"......Milady... It\'s alright now...
 ......Thank you......"
"Don\'t go!!
 Don\'t go, guys!!"
"I beg you, come back!!
 Don\'t leave us like this!!"
"Don\'t leave......Kanon-kun......treated as the culprit!!!!!!!
 Uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh...!!"
"It won\'t reach!!
 The laments of the dead never reach!"
"You make me laugh, yes, that face of yours makes me laugh!!
 You\'re thinking it will reach, aren\'t youuu?
 It won\'t reach, Jessicaaaaaaa!!!
 *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*, wahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!!"
"That\'s no goddamn good."
"Huh?
 .........Battler-kun, did you say something?"
"Yeah, this is no good.
 ...It\'s no goddamn good at all."
At the time everyone made to leave the room,
 ...only Battler had his back to them, and he was still looking down at Jessica\'s body.
"What do you mean, ...it\'s no good at all?
 Do you have some objection...?"
"I\'ll at least agree that we have to be vigilant.
 ......But this talk about having Kanon-kun be the culprit, sorry, but allow me to refuse."
"......Hoh.
 So you\'re biting into this part.
 If Kanon wasn\'t the culprit, and it wasn\'t my doing either, then how do you explain this locked room that Jessica\'s room has become...?"
".........Honestly, I\'ve gotta throw my hands up there.
 ...Seriously, why\'d I say it\'s no goddamn good?"
"...I\'ve gotta take responsibility for my own actions.
 Ihihihihi...!
 ...............I\'m empty-handed with zero weapons to argue with.
 ...But you know, I won\'t stand here twiddling my thumbs anymore!! BEATRICE!!"
"B-......Battler-sama......"
"......I-is there some proof that Kanon-kun isn\'t the culprit......?"
The expression that rose to those two faces was definitely expectant.
......They didn\'t want to believe that Kanon was the culprit.
In truth, they believed in Kanon.
So this expectation was because they wanted to be made to believe in him even more strongly!
"Then, Battler-kun, which of the other servants do you suspect?
 Gohda-san?
 Or is it Kumasawa-san?"
"Quit it, Auntie Rosa.
 ...I know the person called Kumasawa baa-chan well.
 ......She\'ll sometimes slack off on work, but she\'ll always try to make things fun for people.
 ......She is not a person who would kill, not even if her eyes were dazzled by money."
"B-......Battler-sama........."
"And I\'ve just met Gohda-san yesterday.
 ......Honestly, I still don\'t really understand him.
 ......But there is one thing I understand."
"........................I, I........."
"......I\'ve never seen someone look so happy to be making food.
 ...You\'re the same.
 The same as Kumasawa baa-chan.
 ......Gohda-san likes to make people happy."
"As if a person like that could kill those who praised his own food as delicious, ...even if money was piled up in front of him!!"
"...Then, who do you think killed Jessica-chan, Battler-kun?
 Who do you think shut Jessica-chan up in a room that could only be locked by a master key?"
"Wait.
 ......Before I argue about that, there\'s something I want to make clear.
 I don\'t want to talk about, if so-and-so is not the culprit, then so-and-so is the culprit.
 ...I just want to talk about how it\'s completely impossible for Kanon-kun to be the culprit."
"You say that you can establish that Kanon isn\'t the culprit?
 *cackle*, how?!"
"It\'s really simple.
 ...It\'s something I came dangerously close to overlooking.
 ......Beato!"
"Repetition requested!!
 Say it if you can: "Kanon-kun was holding a master key"!!"
"...........................Hoh...!"
"......Kanon-kun wasn\'t holding a master key?!
 How can you tell that?!"
"I heard what Gohda-san said before.
 Just before he split up with Kanon-kun.
 ...The part about when Jessica went to raid the VIP room."
".........Gohda-san, you did a good job remembering it.
 You protected Kanon-kun\'s honor."
"......I,
 ......I...
did...?!"
"I heard him talk about the same thing.
 But I don\'t really understand!
 Could you explain it, Battler-kun?!"
"......That\'s right.
 When Jessica unlocked the VIP room,
 she borrowed the key from Kanon-kun, but didn\'t give it back!
 So Kanon-kun wasn\'t holding a master key!!"
"*cackle*cackle*!
 Or was he?"
"Certainly, Gohda has no recollection of the master key being returned to Kanon.
 However, she might have returned it when Gohda wasn\'t looking!
 How can you prove that it definitely didn\'t happen?!"
"*cackle*cackle*cackle*, if you could just search the pocket of Kanon\'s corpse, you could probably establish that, but you can\'t!!
 It is impossible to prove!!"
"You\'re no goddamn good at all.
 It\'s truly simple to prove, isn\'t it?"
"......No way...!
 So, you\'re saying that Kanon-kun wasn\'t holding a key?!"
"Yeah.
 And to prove it, all you have to do is search Jessica.
 ......Kanon-kun\'s master key should be in Jessica\'s pocket.
 Doctor Nanjo, would you check for us?"
"Ye-......yes."
Nanjo dashed up to Jessica, and searched in her jacket pocket......
Everyone...hoped for it.........!
"......mgh..."
...Please.
 Be there............!!
"......Here it is!
 Is this it?"
"...............Yes.
 That is a master key.
 Without a doubt."
At Genji\'s statement, there was a small "oooh" of joyful voices.
"That is Kanon-kun\'s master key.
 .........I\'ll say it again."
"\'Kanon-kun isn\'t holding a master key\'.
 Therefore, there\'s no way he could have locked the door!!"
"......It certainly does...appear that way.
 ......But Kanon-kun was the last person to meet Jessica-chan.
 The fact that he\'s suspicious hasn\'t changed."
"Let\'s......give that a rest."
"......Huh?"
"Humans were originally supposed to be creatures that trust each other.
 ...But in order to live in a tough world, we learn to be wary.
 ...So we\'ll doubt anything.
 We are sad creatures.
 ...I won\'t deny that\'s our nature."
"...............But I won\'t permit you to come to a conclusion without proof!!
 The suspicious are not the guilty, they are the innocent!!
 Of course, the world is full of wolves.
 I won\'t tell you to carelessly believe everyone!"
"But if you\'re going to say someone\'s guilty, prepare some perfect evidence!
 Unless you can do that, never say someone is guilty because of speculation!!!"
"...............u......
 That\'s........."
"......I was the one who said the suspicious were the guilty.
 .........That was thoughtless.
 I apologize."
"............Battler-sama........."
"...W-wonderful reasoning, Battler-kun!
 Thank you too, Gohda-san.
 Because of what you remembered, Kanon-kun is cleared from suspicion!"
"N-no, I... Hahahaha..."
Clap clap clap...
 ...It was the dry sound of the witch\'s applause.
"Well done, well done.
 ......Not a bad job."
".........Shit.
 Did I just fall for a blatant bait piece...?"
"You wonderfully proved that at least Kanon couldn\'t lock the door to this room.
 The servants should all have been holding master keys.
 With that as a basis, Kanon was treated as the culprit, so you did a wonderful job of at least clearing away that suspicion.
 *cackle*cackle*cackle*."
"......In that case.
 ...How did the culprit who killed Jessica lock the door?
 So that\'s the problem I have now."
"Tch.
 ......I\'ve been drawn into a development that went exactly like you wanted..."
"Right into my trap, yes...?
 Furthermore, you said something outrageous about not doubting any of the other servants.
 Wellll then, it\'ll be worth seeing how you gloss this over..."
"Shut your face.
 ...Let\'s get this started.
 I\'m sure I\'ll be denied from all angles, ...but first I\'ll verify the definition of what it means for this room to be a locked room."
"Very well.
 First,
there are absolutely no types of hidden doors
.
This door is the only way in or out
.
The only way to lock this door is with Jessica\'s single key or the master keys, only one of which is held by each servant
."
"It is on the second floor, but it is probably possible to enter or leave through the window.
 However,
the window is locked from the inside
."
"......Let me flip over the chessboard right away.
 ...If I start by arguing about the door and the lock, I probably won\'t leave the palm of your hand."
"Do as you like.
 Well then, well then, what should I repeat?"
".........Repetition requested.
 "Kanon-kun was killed in this room"."
"Mmhm.
 "
Kanon was killed in this room
".
 Although I erased his corpse with magic, of course?
 *cackle*cackle*cackle*!"
"And again, repetition requested.
 "Kanon-kun\'s corpse is in this room"."
"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!
 I decline.
 I cannot repeat it.
 ...Because I erased the corpse with magic.
 *giggle*giggle*giggle*!"
"Of course you wouldn\'t.
 ......There\'s got to be a secret hidden in there somewhere."
" ......Damn, where\'s the point of contention to this riddle?
 .........Is it that they locked it without a master key?
 Or is it how they managed to kill two people who were inside a room with the door locked?
 Or is it how they managed to escape after killing them both?"
"......I hate to say it, but I\'ll have to tackle this one step at a time.
 ...Repetition requested.
 ......\'The last time it was locked was by a master key\'."
"I also decline that.
 *cackle*cackle*."
"......This declining thing is really vague.
 I don\'t know if you decline because it\'s impossible to repeat, or whether you can repeat it and you\'re declining on purpose..."
"Back when discussing the lock to the chapel, you completely turned the tables on me.
 When I have an advantage, there\'s no need to go out of my way to speak using the red, which carries risk.
 That\'s all it is."
".........Yeah, I guess so.
 ...At its heart, the red is something you use when you want to stop my strange theories."
"It is natural that I would use it to my advantage.
 Because of the risk of it being quibbled with, I won\'t use it uselessly."
"...*cackle*cackle*.
 Well then, what move will you come at me with next?
 A move that puts Gohda or Kumasawa under suspicion would probably be the easiest to use, right...?"
"......Damn.
 It\'s like you\'re leading me down a path, goddamn annoying...
 Stay quiet a while, I\'m thinking...!"
"Of course, this door is the same as the chapel.
When locked, it does not permit any form of entry or exit
."
"I\'ll say more. 
No trick could have the effect of locking the door from the outside without using a key
.
 *cackle*cackle*...!"
"Tch.
 Damn you for always using red when I don\'t ask for it..."
............Let\'s back up.
 ...Let me just think.
I\'ll lay out everything I know.
First, there are two victims.
Jessica and Kanon-kun.
...Kanon-kun\'s corpse isn\'t here, but BEATRICE admitted in red that Kanon-kun was killed.
So even without a corpse, he\'s included as a victim.
There are a few questionable points.
 And depending on which I focus on, my line of thought changes a lot.
First, after the culprit committed murder in this room, how did they lock it?
If we assume that the culprit was one of those holding a master key, it\'s extremely simple.
......But I want to avoid that if I can.
Because I would have to suspect Gohda-san or Kumasawa-san - no, in the worst case, even Shannon-chan and Genji-san.
At this point, I noticed something.
......I\'m contradicting myself.
I\'m cutting my own throat.
I want to deny BEATRICE no matter what.
I want to erase the existence of that brutal, fickle, ridiculous witch!
In order to do that, I have to explain everything with humans, not magic.
......But that also means suspecting some human.
I don\'t want to suspect someone.
......Of course, if there was some clear proof, I would have to believe that person was the culprit,
 ...but as long as that didn\'t happen, I didn\'t want to cast any suspicions.
Am I just green...?
Am I just a kid who doesn\'t want to have my feelings, which tell me that at least this person or that person couldn\'t be a murderer, betrayed...?
I want to deny that it was a witch; I also want to deny that it was a human.
.........Now I don\'t know what is what anymore...
"*cackle*cackle*!
 In the first place, the only victory condition in our game regarded whether or not you could deny my existence.
 ...Even though that alone was a game that put you at a disadvantage, you\'ve increased the number of victory conditions all by yourself, and made your own victory difficult...!"
......It\'s just as she says.
 ...If I started arguing that someone holding a master key was the culprit, this locked room could be easily broken.
......However, since the number of keys that could open this door are limited,
 and furthermore it\'s clearly known who holds them,
 saying that would mean that I was suspecting someone I knew well...
...No, ......have I just been averting my eyes?
In that locked room trick with the chapel, which had been exhilarating to destroy,
 I had proposed that "someone stole the key from Maria\'s handbag, and returned it".
 If that theory was right, then the question becomes who could have stolen the key from her handbag.
...Maria\'s handbag had probably been at its most unguarded when she was sleeping.
......In that case,
 .........in addition to me,
 ...George-aniki and Jessica are also suspects.
George-aniki or Jessica was the culprit?
Or maybe an accomplice?!
......All of our parents had been killed, right?!
And yet, ......and yet, one of us consented to that and assisted with the crime?!
We had lamented, mourned, and shed tears in the chapel.
...And yet, one among us......had been lying?!
"......*cackle*cackle*.
 That theory of yours about taking the key out of the handbag and putting it back cast a pronounced suspicion on the cousins, did it not...?"
"Quite impressive - in spite of that, you managed to act like you didn\'t notice,
 and spoke your theory with such gusto...!
 *giggle*giggle*giggle*."
"D-............damn it...
 That doesn\'t guarantee that one of the family or the servants is the culprit!
 If you snuck up on us hiding in a cardboard box, for example,
 there\'s a good chance you could have slunk into our room when we were fast asleep and stolen the key, right?!"
"Mmm.
 That would also be acceptable in that instance.
 By suspecting me as the guest, the 19th person, you won\'t have to suspect them."
".........But then, what will you do about the lock to Jessica\'s room?
 It\'s no trouble at all for me to open the lock with magic, but of course, I don\'t have a master key.
 If you deny my magic, you also have to deny that I\'m a suspect, you realize...?"
"And what that entails is suspecting one of you 18...!!"
"Tha-......thanks for the lovely explanation.
 ...I\'ve been able to sort things out a bit."
"......My goal is to pursue how the 19th person, the Human guest BEATRICE, committed the crimes.
 If I do that, I won\'t have to suspect anyone!!"
"*cackle*cackle*!
 If you can do that, yes...!
 Foolish man.
 ......A room like this never needed to be a locked room at all.
 After all, there are a total of six keys that can open it."
"And there were several who possessed those keys!
 You can suspect any of them!
 Suspect as much as you like!!
 But you went to all the trouble of denying all of those, and made it a locked room yourself."
".........Understand?
 This is a locked room born from your mental contradiction.
 *cackle*cackle*!
 There\'s no one else, you closed that door yourself."
"......So accept that a witch opened it with magic,
 ...or accept that someone I know is the culprit - those are my only two options, you\'re saying.
 Damn, are you trying to fork the rook?!"
"I merely wanted to show you that this move also exists."
"......*cackle*.
 So, what will you do, Ushiromiya Battleeeeeeer?
 Isn\'t it a truly simple problemmm...?
 You just have to make sacrifices of that overly self-confident cook and that hag who should have died yeeears ago.
 *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!"
"...............Damn it!!
 So if I suspect Gohda-san and Kumasawa-san, everything\'s fine?!
 That\'s no good!"
".........I can\'t think of Gohda-san as the culprit!
 I can\'t think of Kumasawa-san as the culprit!!
 But I won\'t accept you!!
 Ever!!"
"In that case, they would have to enter the room without using magic or a master key,
 kill Jessica and Kanon, and even erase Kanon\'s corpse without using magic."
"......How could it be done?!
 How could it be done so that you can deny me and not suspect anyone at the same time?!!
 *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!"
"............Resign."
"Huh?
 Battler-kun, what did you say?"
"......I give up.
 I was able to prove that Kanon-kun couldn\'t have locked this door.
 ......But that doesn\'t mean I was able to figure out who killed Jessica."
"N-......no, ...that\'s more than enough...
 Umm, ......for doing all that for Kanon-kun,
 ...thank you very much...!"
"......I don\'t want thanks.
 After all, ......that means that you\'re under suspicion too."
"....................."
"...And sorry, Auntie Rosa.
 ......It\'s not like I wanted to be defiant towards you.
 I don\'t want to die either, and I want to find Dad and the rest\'s true killer.
 ......Sorry for saying something that wasn\'t cooperative."
"......No, it\'s alright.
 I was also a little rash.
 Let\'s make up.
 As auntie and nephew, we have to be friendly with each other.
 ............Right?"
Auntie Rosa shifted the gun to one hand, and held out her other hand.
...I reached out, and for the time being, we shook hands.
Auntie\'s gaze was sharp.
......In order to deny the witch, she would make anyone a sacrifice.
...That\'s what her eyes told me.
And me...?
I denied the witch.
......But I wasn\'t prepared to lose anything.
I was probably the one who thought himself most ready to fight, ......and the one standing furthest from the truth.
