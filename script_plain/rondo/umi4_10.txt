I had been trying to take a nap, ......but the boat really was shaking bad.
I gave up on sleeping and went up onto the deck.
I was welcomed by the shining sun and a strong sea breeze...
Up on the deck, Amakusa was doing some stretches.
......He probably has a lot of time on his hands too.
It\'ll still take a while longer to reach Niijima.
It would only have taken on the order of half an hour by airplane, but there was the chance that the Sumaderas\' net extended over Niijima airport.
The harbor would probably be the same.
 For that reason, I had obtained a boat that would let me land while avoiding the harbor, with no questions asked.
I\'d bumped into a cheery boat captain,
 treated him with generosity, and he had decided to help me out, amused......
"Still going to be a while?"
"I just asked the captain, and it sounds like it\'ll take a full two hours more.
 Well, beggars can\'t be choosers."
".........The weather sure is nice.
 Feels like I\'ll burn."
"Going to read on the deck?
 You\'ll damage your book."
Amakusa apparently got that idea because I was clutching Maria onee-chan\'s diary under my arm.
I\'d been reading it as I tried to fall asleep, which was why I had come back up still carrying it.
"How\'s it going?
 Think you\'ll be able to find the truth of Rokkenjima from Maria-san\'s diary?"
"............Who knows.
 No matter how much I investigate what happened on that island, it won\'t make for anything more than a theory.
 There\'s no truth written in the message bottles or Onee-chan\'s diary, just a fairy tale with a witch walking around.
 ......I\'m stuck."
"Looks like you\'re just going to have to bank on what you can get out of the relevant people on Niijima."
"I imagine the Witch Hunters have subjected them to endless questioning, so I\'m pretty sure I won\'t find any new facts."
"Hehhaha...!
 So even though your hopes are that low, you\'re willing to spend a half-day trip on a boat to go to Niijima anyway! You really are fickle."
".........It\'s like a journey of self-satisfaction, so that I can say "I investigated".
 I\'m not so naive as to seriously think that I can unlock the truth of twelve years ago."
"When you\'ve finished with your self-satisfaction, what do you plan to do?"
"Who knows.
 Haven\'t thought about it.
 .........I\'ll go to Niijima, ask some questions of people related to all this.
 ...Then, after going to Rokkenjima in the end and leaving some flowers, my journey will be over."
.........Several days had already passed since this journey began.
After being told by BERNKASTEL on the roof of that building...
to search for the truth of twelve years ago, I left on a journey akin to trying to grasp a cloud.
At the time, I felt something mystical about it, and I remember feeling as if I might be able to grasp some kind of miracle at the end of this journey.
......But several days are enough to bring a person back down from that high.
As I stood on the roof of that skyscraper that day, my heart had nowhere left to go - it was completely dead.
......Wanting from the bottom of my heart to be released from the cage of my body and rise into the sky,
 ......I crossed the fence in order to die.
Maybe experiencing the desire to die and actually stepping forwards, throwing my body down...
caused some kind of mystical experience inside my head, making me think I had received a message from a witch.
.........The more the excitement from jumping down lessened over time, and the more I came back to my senses, the more this journey lost its meaning.
But I\'d never considered suspending this journey just because of that.
If I stopped this journey, it would mean acknowledging that the message from that witch was an illusion.
And I felt as if that meant throwing away the promise the witch had made,
 and any chance that someone from my family might come back.
So, I\'m continuing this journey because I want to believe in that illusion.
I don\'t seriously believe that this journey will change anything.
......I\'m even free to end it at any time.
 It\'s up to me to choose where the final destination is.
In the end, this journey is only for my personal self-satisfaction......
"............Self-satisfaction, is it.
 It sounds bad when you say it out loud, but I think that actually, that\'s life."
"......Heh.
 If that\'s the answer you reached after crawling across the line between life and death in the mercenary business, that\'s probably pretty deep."
"Don\'t just laugh it off.
 What I\'m trying to say is that there\'s no self about it - in this world, the only one capable of satisfying you is yourself."
Amakusa continued stretching as he spoke.
In an annoyingly eloquent way.
Hearing it told to me as though from a teacher made me instinctively want to resist, but what he was saying was extremely sensible.
".....................
 ......That may be true."
"People work hard when they want to satisfy someone.
 ......In most cases, that someone is their parents.
 Children learn how to work hard because they want to be praised by their parents.
 .........Of course, that\'s why I never learned."
"Sorry, that\'s not what I intended to say."
"......What I want to say is that self-satisfaction is A-OK.
 No matter who praises you, it\'s meaningless unless you yourself are satisfied.
 ......Turning it around, even if no one praises you, that doesn\'t matter as long as you\'re satisfied yourself."
".........Self-satisfaction and self-improvement contradict each other, so we\'re usually taught that the former is bad.
 Your argument is kind of a breath of fresh air."
"The anguish of the human world comes when you want to satisfy someone, you want recognition, but you don\'t know where to put the effort.
 I had a time like that too."
"I wanted recognition, but I didn\'t know what I wanted recognition for.
 And since I didn\'t know what I was meant to put effort into, or how much, or even who I wanted to give me that recognition,
 I did a lot of crazy things."
"And the answer you reached......was self-satisfaction?"
"It sounds bad, but that\'s how it is.
 Rich is the one who is content with what they are, they say."
".........If I\'ve decided this is the life I\'m happy with, no one has any right to tell me any different.
 It\'s the same for your life, and for this journey.
 No one has any right to object other than you yourself."
"You are the only one who determines the meaning and worth of your journey.
 If it turns out to have been a meaningful journey for you, then that\'s more than enough."
"...........................
 .........I thought you were the kind of guy who never takes things seriously, but you really do say some weird things every once in a while.
 I\'ll bet you think saying things like that every now and then will make you a hit with the ladies."
"You\'ve got me all wrong.
 That\'s not why I said it.
 .........It looks like you want to be alone.
 I\'ll be over with the boat captain.
 Please, take your time."
It seemed Amakusa had decided I was in a bad mood.
......Although I didn\'t feel that way myself.
Maybe he had just finished a set of stretches and wanted to cool off in the shade.
The sea winds were strong, but not enough to take the edge off the rays of the sun.
Amakusa disappeared.
 Only I remained.
".........Self-satisfaction is life, he says."
"That\'s just boring.
 Life is nothing without greed."
I noticed that Mammon had suddenly appeared, her full hair streaming out in the wind by the prow of the ship.
"It\'s true that a life of greed would be fun.
 But unlike you, Humans have a limited lifespan."
"If a person remains greedy for eternity, that means that they have desires even in the last moment before they die.
 Having desires means that there\'s something they want.
 Something they don\'t have, some way they aren\'t complete."
"......I\'m sure it\'s tough to die when you can\'t think of yourself as being fulfilled.
 So I\'m sure self-satisfaction is actually necessary."
".........I see.
 Then beings with lifespans need to make that kind of compromise?
 Our masters always had very long lifespans, so I\'ve never thought of it."
"I wonder if Humans live so that they can be satisfied.
 ......If so, to seek nothing is probably the easiest way to live.
 ...Yes, it makes sense why greed is one of the seven deadly sins."
"*giggle*.
 Your praise honors me."
Apparently that counted as praise in Mammon\'s eyes.
She turned and gave a graceful curtsy.
"Ange-sama.
 Do Humans live so that they can be satisfied at the moment of their death?"
"......It must be pretty tough to be somehow incomplete at the moment of your death, right?"
"If so, then Humans live only so that they can have a satisfying death.
 They live so that they can have a better death.
 They live to die."
............Wow, that\'s a hell of a thing to say.
...Yes, I should have expected that from a demon stake.
However, her words might be the truth.
 Humans suffer because they aren\'t whole, and live only to be made whole.
That might be the same, in other words, as a desire to die - to die while whole.
"I have no argument against that.
 ......People live in order to be content.
 And they hope to die while still content.
 So, not knowing how to make yourself content, make yourself complete, is very tough."
"How does a Human do that?
 Make their life complete."
".........Receiving validation, acceptance.
 That they\'re happy."
"If it doesn\'t matter who accepts you, then I\'ll do it myself, if you like."
"Yes, that\'s just it.
 .........People don\'t know whose acceptance they need."
"So, searching for that person to accept them is the journey of life?
 Hmmmm."
"It sounds strange, doesn\'t it?
 Whether you find acceptance or not, it shouldn\'t change your circumstances.
 ......And yet, if you find acceptance you\'ll be whole, and if you don\'t then you won\'t."
"...It\'s almost like the blue bird.
 ......Even though the blue bird is already in the cage, you can\'t notice it, so you have to go out on a journey searching everywhere."
"What the heck.
 Kyahhahaha.
 Human lives sure are stupid."
"That\'s right.
 Amakusa really hit on something.
 ......Rich is the one who is content with what they are...was it?
 I don\'t know where that proverb came from, but it\'s deep."
"......In short, if you won\'t be fully content unless you have someone\'s acceptance, that\'s the same as not being able to accept yourself.
 ......Turns out the ultimate self-fulfillment begins with self-acceptance."
"Well, of course.
 Because if you can become aware that you\'re fulfilled, there\'s no need for anyone else\'s acceptance.
 Just by taking notice of that small little thing, a Human\'s foolish lifelong journey can be ended easily."
"Then they can spend the rest of their life effectively, playing and having a good time.
 A Human\'s life is so ridiculous, kyahhahahaha!"
Mammon\'s choice of words was bad, but it was surely the truth.
If most of a Human\'s life...
is a journey wishing for someone\'s acceptance so that they can achieve a satisfied death...
.........then the moment they realize that the person to accept them is not someone else, but them themselves, they can end that pointless journey.
Humans who have finished that journey can probably spend the rest of their lives as they wish with their heads held high.
......How sublime, how praiseworthy would that be.
"You know,
 it seems Amakusa\'s on pretty bad terms with his parents.
 ......Makes sense, right?
 Amakusa\'s in the kind of trade that any sane parent would want their kid to wash his hands of."
"Why does it matter?
 If he\'s enjoying it."
".........Exactly.
 That\'s what it comes down to in the end.
 Your worth as observed by others doesn\'t matter."
"If your existence is firmly accepted by you yourself, that\'s enough.
 ......If you can live with confidence in yourself, surely you can accept and find satisfaction in any kind of lifestyle."
"I\'m sure Amakusa will eventually eat a stray bullet on the battlefield and get seriously injured.
 ...He might even die."
"But I don\'t think Amakusa will think of it as unfair.
 I\'m sure he\'d cackle about how that too is life."
"What a great way to live.
 I\'m enchanted."
"......Pitiful Humans who can\'t accept themselves...
wander about searching for it their whole lives, doing nothing but grumbling and complaining, unable to come to terms with anything, ultimately dying while still unfulfilled."
"......How pitiful.
 Compared to people whose lives drag on without any purpose,
 Amakusa is more likely to eventually die by the roadside, but I think he\'s much more noble for living his life with his chest stuck out."
"Maybe the enlightened are the winners in life?
 If you can come to that realization even a little sooner, you\'ll be able to put that much more of your life to good use."
.........At those words of Mammon\'s,
 ......I finally came to terms with a certain fact.
I had......described her as an abnormal kid, a little strange.
However,
 ......that wasn\'t the case.
She had simply...
......finished that journey faster than anyone else, and taught herself to keep her own chin up and live with confidence.
".....................Maybe that\'s what made Maria onee-chan...so amazing.
 She had already reached that point at the age where she was only just about to begin elementary school."
Other people like us, looking at her life from the outside, couldn\'t call it happy by any standard.
But even though such days were engraved in her diary,
 ......the entries always finished up by saying it was a happy day.
Even though you can catch glimpses of her mother\'s lack of love for her,
 in spite of that, she believed that her mother did love her.
The mother\'s love that didn\'t exist, she created herself, filling her world with love.
Others observed her as an unfulfilled, pitiful girl,
 ......but she told herself that she was fulfilled, and accepted herself how she was.
And so, she was happy that way.
It\'s easy to observe that as something pitiable and sad.
 But to her, that was an outsider\'s opinion, and didn\'t matter in the slightest.
The only important thing was whether or not this was happiness to her.
It\'s just like how, when people who live in the city point to the lifestyles of those in the country,
 and lament the inconvenience and feel sympathy for them, it\'s really just misplaced kindness.
If those who live there are satisfied with what they have, that\'s more than enough.
".........I\'ve finally realized something.
 ...I realized it just now.
 ......I did something horrible to Maria onee-chan.
 .........And to all of you, and Sakutarou as well, on that day."
"................................."
"The question of whether magic exists, or not.
 ......That\'s not up to other people to decide."
"It\'s up to you yourself.
 Whether magic exists to Maria onee-chan is a problem for Maria onee-chan to decide, and not for me."
"......And yet, when I was young, I said it, that day.
 I told her there\'s no way magic exists, ......and I hurt her."
To me, magic doesn\'t exist - but that\'s my world.
Denying Onee-chan\'s world as well just because of that was totally barking up the wrong tree.
"Mariage Sorciere is the witches\' alliance Maria onee-chan created.
 I was invited into that, and invited to become a witch with her."
"I thought it was a fun new game, and I went along with it for a while.
 ......But, because of the cruelty of youth,
 I got tired of it half-way through.
 And then......with sharp words, I tore her pure and innocent heart apart."
"......At that time, we must have gotten into a huge fight.
 I forgot about it right away, but it was unforgettable for her.
 ......After all, to her, magic was a natural power that emphatically existed,
 and she believed that she\'d be able to share that with me."
"......Magic, to Maria onee-chan,
 was a power by which she could give the world a happy interpretation, ......no, which could make everything happy - it truly was a magical power.
 She just wanted to share that with me too."
"The young me tore those feelings apart.
 ......So she closed herself up in a shell, believing that no one could understand magic with her."
".........If so, then Lady MARIA\'s life-journey wasn\'t over after all.
 If she had accepted herself, there would be no need for her to feel down just because you denied her."
"Onee-chan was young.
 She still hadn\'t reached the same kind of philosophical viewpoint as Amakusa.
 ......Ahh, and that explains it perfectly.
 Why the witches\' alliance called Mariage Sorciere was necessary."
 -  - An alliance where each accepts that the other is a witch.
"...That\'s right - I\'m pretty sure that was the first article in the agreement of Mariage Sorciere.
 ......Witches of the alliance must accept each other and respect each other.
 That is the deepest and the only meaning of the witches\' alliance......"
Maria onee-chan wanted to share with me the secret laws for making the world happy, called magic.
But I was young.
 And she was too.
......I hurt her with innocent cruelty.
".........On that day, I said it, ...those reckless words.
 To all of you and Sakutarou.
 I said there\'s no way you exist."
"I\'m offended.
 We accept that we exist ourselves.
 We\'re not like Humans, with their souls half-asleep.
 ......\'I think, therefore I am\'."
"Whether you accept or deny magic, the existence of the magic called the Seven Stakes of Purgatory...is therefore a fact.
 ......As long as we accept ourselves, to borrow your words."
"It truly would be violence for another person like me to deny that.
 .........I\'m sure that would be like having your true mother yell "I wish you had never been born",
 no, "get out of my life"."
......Even after being slammed by all those words,
 ......Maria onee-chan\'s magic...
......made her believe in her mother\'s love.
Sakutarou, her magic friend, always encouraged her.
......He kept saying that her mother loved her, that she was coming home late because of her work,
 and that she would definitely bring back a present.
Even after Maria learned the fact that it really wasn\'t because of work, magic still kept her believing that.
So by believing that her mother loved her, by accepting herself,
 she filled her world with love and peace and serenity, ......and established it perfectly.
"What happened twelve years ago, ...what happened to my family.
 ......This was...not a journey to search for that."
"............Then what is this journey?"
"It was a journey......to apologize to Maria onee-chan for what happened that day."
".............................."
"I don\'t know why, but that\'s what I think.
 ......If I hadn\'t hurt her that day,
 .........the incident twelve years ago might not have occurred.
 ......That\'s what I think."
I have no basis for it.
 I don\'t have a clue how hurting Onee-chan would be connected to that mysterious incident several years later.
But for some reason, I can\'t imagine that there is no connection.
A witch caused that incident.
And the culprit is the Golden Witch, BEATRICE.
And BEATRICE was part of the Mariage Sorciere Alliance of Witches.
I had horribly hurt the other witch of that alliance.
I had hurt her by saying that magic doesn\'t exist.
.........And that\'s why, several years later, an inexplicable crime by a witch occurred,
 and that two-day period which can\'t be explained with anything but magic was thrust in my face via a message bottle.
"......I\'m sure that I\'m not unrelated.
 .........I don\'t know.
 It could be chance, it could be fate.
 .........For some reason, I\'ve just started thinking that way on this journey."
"And your basis?"
"None.
 It\'s just what I\'m thinking."
"Hmmmm......
 The Japanese sure are interesting.
 Even if they\'re the victim, they feel as though they did something wrong, and apologize for no reason."
"......I could understand if you said "I hate BEATRICE-sama for stealing my family!" or something,
 but you really are an odd one, feeling guilty for no reason and apologizing."
"Of course I hate BEATRICE.
 I couldn\'t continue this journey without that feeling."
"But it\'s alright for me to find another purpose to this journey.
 There\'s nothing wrong with me adding the goal of apologizing for past sins onto this journey for revenge on a witch of twelve years prior.
 I can at least go to Rokkenjima, apologize for my reckless remarks, and offer flowers."
"......No, .........there\'s something better than flowers.
 And I think that would be more fitting for Onee-chan."
I stood up, and, ignoring my hair being blown about by the sea breeze, I concentrated my mind......
I lifted my palms up to the height of my head, ......and imagined a vast space......
"............Ange-sama..............."
"......Quiet.
 ........................"
"......Come, arise.
 ......I am the witch apprentice, ANGE BEATRICE.
 ......Though I was excommunicated, I was once a member of the same alliance, and you are dearly missed furniture who played with me.
 Answer to my call........."
It was hard to tell in the middle of the day, but a faint blue light gathered around the palms of my hands.
.........Then,
 .........I revived Sakutarou\'s form.
It truly was long-missed, that figure.
His cute ears, his bright-red scarf.
......It came off easily, so Onee-chan faithfully re-wrapped it all the time, didn\'t she...
"......Sakutaro......
 ......Recognize us?
 Do you know who we are...?"
\'...Uryu......?
 Uryu......?
 Mammon...?
 Ange.........?\'
With a sleepy face, as though waking up from a long slumber, Sakutarou looked all around him as he spoke.
"It\'s been a long time, ......Sakutarou.
 I\'m pretty sure this is the first time I\'ve summoned you with my own power.
 ......And now, I\'m the only one who can."
\'..................Uryu......\'
Those words might have been a bit cruel.
Sakutarou\'s face clouded over...
"In the past, I denied you.
 .........Now that I have summoned you,
 ......that means that I have accepted your existence."
\'.........Is it okay......?
 Is it okay...for me to be summoned into your world......?\'
His eyes were slightly frightened.
......It was only natural.
 I, who had played with him like a friend before,
 had one day suddenly denied him and tried to burn him with the anti-magic toxin.
It was only natural that he was scared......
"I apologize.
 For that day.
 .........To you too, Mammon.
 And to the rest of you."
At some point, ......the rest of the Seven Sisters had gathered on the deck.
No, they are there at all times.
 Always by my side.
As long as I accept that it\'s okay for them to be there, they will appear anytime.
"You certainly do exist.
 Lucifer.
 And Leviathan.
 And Satan.
 And Belphegor.
 And Mammon.
 And Beelzebub.
 And Asmodeus.
 ......And Sakutarou too."
"......Is that alright?
 Ange-sama, you are one who is challenging BEATRICE-sama.
 ...Is it alright for one in a position of denying witches to accept us?"
"About whether magic exists or not in my world, sorry, but let me put that question on hold.
 It\'s not like I myself have accepted the existence of magic."
"......Yet you accept us? How do you explain that contradiction?"
"Because magic exists for people who believe.
 Even if I don\'t.
 If someone believes, then magic will exist in that person\'s world."
"That will not be interfered with in any way, whether I believe in magic or not.
 No, it must not be interfered with."
"That person just needs to hold their head up high and believe in their own magic.
 And I will accept that.
 So it isn\'t strange at all for you guys to exist."
".........That\'s quite the rationalization...but, an interesting interpretation, I would say."
"What you\'re saying, Ange-sama, is probably a Devil\'s Proof."
"A Devil\'s Proof......?"
"After all!
 To prove the existence of demons, you just need to bring one with you..."
"But denying the existence of demons is impossible!"
"Kyahha!
 And we are here.
 That means that whether Ange-sama believes in magic or not, our existence is unshakable."
\'......Uryu?
 The anti-magic toxin...
.........is disappearing...
...from Ange......\'
"Y-you\'re right......
 ......But she\'s in a position of denying magic......so why......?"
"That\'s probably......
......because I learned respect and acceptance.
 Now, ......I might be able to understand...
...the depths of Maria onee-chan\'s magic......and BEATRICE\'s."
In the past, I insisted that I didn\'t believe in things like magic,
 that something like that couldn\'t exist - I acted like I had my eyes tightly shut and couldn\'t see anything.
But now I\'m different.
 I get the feeling I can look right at the thing called magic, and close in on its true nature......
"......How frustrating.
 It\'s truly rare to find a Human so free of the anti-magic toxin in this day and age.
 And she has such an uncommon genius for being a witch..."
"That\'s right.
 ......If Ange-sama tried to become a witch now,
 ......she could grow to be a Great Witch, maybe even at BEATRICE-sama\'s level."
"Even so, she is our master, and has accepted our existence.
 ......Most likely, Ange-sama will be our final master.
 Let us think of this as our final service, and apply ourselves to the fullest."
"......Bleghh.
 I just can\'t sta~nd that Ange-sama still doesn\'t believe in magic herself."
"......Ange-samaaa, please believe in magic too~.
 Feels like a waste to finally have a master and have it not be a wi~tch."
"Even though you have outstanding talent which could make you one of the greatest of witches, your goal is to slay them.
 It\'s such a shame."
"......Well, that\'s her life, her way of living,
 and if that\'s the way she\'s decided her world is going to be, there\'s nothing we can achieve by complaining."
"Thanks for understanding me.
 Yeah, whether magic exists to me or not,
 that\'s up to me to decide.
 Whether magic actually does exist somewhere in the world or not, you see?"
When I think about it, the world is so vast, ......and yet so small.
Billions of people live on the Earth.
But I probably won\'t meet even one percent of those people.
Even so, I will speak of the world.
Without knowing even one percent of the world - I will speak of "my world".
"I\'m not qualified to deny the laws of a world I don\'t know.
 ......So just because magic doesn\'t exist in my world, I can\'t deny that magic exists in a world I don\'t know."
"That makes it a true Devil\'s Proof.
 No, maybe it\'s more like "when in Rome, do as the Romans do"."
I can be confident in the world I know.
 So even if my world is denied by a complete stranger who doesn\'t know a thing about it, that\'s nothing to worry about.
And in the same way, just because I don\'t know another world,
 that doesn\'t make me qualified to deny it.
"Which is why,
 regardless of whether there is magic in my world or not,
 ......I cannot deny the magic Maria onee-chan taught me."
\'Uryu!
 After all, even if you\'ve never seen it,
 ......magic exists!\'
"Yes.
 That\'s why, as I\'ve already said,
 ......your existence, as friends of the Mariage Sorciere Alliance of Witches,
 cannot be denied by me or anyone else."
I proclaimed the most important part again.
............Even though the sea breeze and the crashing of the waves were noisy, it was a time of silence.
Both Sakutarou and the Seven Sisters of Purgatory......reflected upon my words.
And, probably, I did too.
Does magic exist or not - 
Do witches exist or not - 
I reflected on the fact that, while ignoring what the answer was within my world, ......I had declared openly that I would accept their existence, despite it being a contradiction.
\'Thank you, ......Ange.\'
"If you will accept that much, perhaps one day, witches could also - 
 ...No, that was a foolish question.
 You already have a clear answer to that question."
"Sorry.
 I do accept that witches might exist somewhere in this world.
 But my world will not waver."
"......You won\'t accept witches or magic.
 You\'ll definitely expose the truth of Rokkenjima.
 ......Right?"
"Yes.
 That is my world.
 Even if a witch really does exist, I won\'t accept her in my world.
 No matter how much that witch tries to court me."
"Your position is to slay witches.
 ......And I now understand well that you have not the slightest wavering in that feeling!"
"We are your furniture, the Seven Sisters of Purgatory...!
 We will always be by your side.
 We will always be waiting for the day that we can be useful...!"
"Although, since you don\'t believe in magic, we can never be anything more than someone to talk to."
"That\'s enough for now.
 We\'ve been left room to exist.
 For that alone, we should thank and accept Ange-sama."
"In short!
 All of uuuuus..."
\'Can be together again......
 Uryuu!!\'
"Kyaaah!!
 Sakutaroo!
 Let me fluffle youuuuuuuuu~!!"
As Sakutarou was overcome with emotion and tears came to his eyes, the Seven Sisters closed in and mobbed him.
......They were also celebrating a long-awaited reunion.
Because they were granted permission to exist, they can exist here without doubt.
No - they can exist even if I don\'t permit it.
Because I accepted them, they showed their reunion\'s joy to me as well.
As I watched over that scene, .........I reflected on the meaning of this journey of mine.
".........I wonder if everyone will forgive me this way."
"You\'ve done enough.
 We are furniture.
 Just being summoned,
 just being allowed to be by your side makes us happy."
\'Uryu...!
 Ange, thank you very much......!\'
"......Come to think of it, why was I able to summon Sakutarou?
 ......No, it\'s the other way around.
 Why wasn\'t Onee-chan able to summon Sakutarou?"
Maria onee-chan had despaired, thinking that Sakutarou had died.
Which told me that she hadn\'t been able to summon him like this anymore.
In the past, Onee-chan said it was more advantageous in a summoning to have a vessel.
However, a vessel is like training wheels, and it shouldn\'t be absolutely necessary.
......In other words, even if the stuffed animal lion that was Sakutarou\'s vessel didn\'t exist, it should have been possible to summon him.
......In fact, for that matter,
 it\'s a little doubtful whether summoned beings even have the concept of life and death.
Moreover, Sakutarou was an especially important friend to Maria onee-chan.
She should have been able to strive hard to summon him one more time.
It certainly was sad that the original stuffed animal vessel had been torn apart,
 but why was he "dead", and why couldn\'t she summon him again......?
\'...That\'s because...
at that time, Maria saw my stuffed animal get torn,
 and she decided
 that I had died.\'
"It\'s the same as the existence of magic.
 ......If, in Lady MARIA\'s world, it becomes a fact that Sakutarou died,
 then Sakutarou cannot exist in her world."
\'............Uryu......\'
The shock of having her beloved stuffed animal torn apart...
had left a wound in her heart serious enough to prevent her from ever again summoning her irreplaceable close friend.
In Maria onee-chan\'s eyes, Sakutarou had died.
So even if Sakutarou could exist like this to me, he could not exist before her.
\'I......was always together with Maria......
 ......As she cried, I was there the whole time right beside her, telling her not to cry......
 ......But my form, my voice, ......nothing of me would reach her......\'
Sakutarou hung his head, looking sad.
"......After that incident, the nature of Mariage Sorciere rapidly began to change.
 Before then, the alliance was a peaceful thing."
"But after the incident, it grew full of shadier things, focusing on how to curse people you hate.
 ......Onee-chan\'s diary began to show a clear change."
A diary is a mirror that reflects one\'s heart as it is.
It probably showed the personality called Maria die,
 and be reborn as the evil witch personality MARIA.
As she filled the diary with hatred and sadness, ......her heart surely was not fulfilled.
Because she wasn\'t fulfilled, she had no choice but to fill it with hatred and sadness.
And while still unfulfilled, she met with death.
......I wonder if her unfulfilled soul has a hole opened in its chest from sadness even now,
 and continually wanders, tears dripping down and calling Sakutarou\'s name......
.................................
"...............You......are needed by Onee-chan."
\'Uryu.........\'
"What can I do to revive you in Maria onee-chan\'s world?
 If I can learn how to do that, I\'ll be able to save Onee-chan.
 ......That is the method of atonement I am tasked with.
 What can be done to revive you?"
\'......My vessel had a very important meaning to Maria......\'
"The vessel.
 ......So, if we could revive the lion stuffed animal..."
\'But......
 ......Mama Rosa made my stuffed animal herself, so only Mama Rosa can make it......\'
Even inside the diary, Maria onee-chan had asked this of BEATRICE, and had been refused for the same reason.
The magical significance of a stuffed animal being unique and handmade is very large.
Then, if we could make the same thing once more......
But Aunt Rosa is already gone from this world.
We can never make the same thing again.
"......Was there ever another identical stuffed animal made, or anything like that?"
"He is a stuffed animal made for Lady MARIA\'s birthday present, and is the only one in the world.
 ......A handmade and unique vessel.
 That\'s why it conceals a great magical power."
"And......if lost, it will never be obtained again.
 It will not revive..."
\'.........Uryu.........\'
......Maria onee-chan knew that,
 so when she saw that stuffed animal, unique in the world, be torn apart,
 .........she despaired.
Because it was a stuffed animal unique in the world,
 and it permitted her no compromises such as simply buying another, ......she despaired from the bottom of her heart......
"......But Sakutarou is right here.
 Even without a vessel, he\'s here.
 I accept that, and so he firmly exists in my world."
".........Even if Maria onee-chan doesn\'t accept him, that fact cannot be denied.
 Right...?"
"Logically, that\'s true,
 ......but I think using the same logic to make Lady MARIA accept him could be difficult."
\'......Maria.........
 ......I\'m not dead...
 I\'m right here.........
 ......Uryu......\'
"I\'m sure that on Rokkenjima,
 ......I\'ll be able to be reunited with Maria onee-chan.
 And, ......no matter what, I\'m going to revive you inside Onee-chan, and let you be reunited too."
\'Can you do that......?\'
"It will probably be hard.
 ......Just like how, after being invited into the witches\' alliance, I rejected it without understanding what it meant,
 she might also reject your existence."
".........But I\'ve got to do it.
 That\'s the only way I can atone for my sins."
"............Ange-sama......"
"What is waiting on Rokkenjima?
 And what will happen, what will I be able to achieve?
 ......Although maybe nothing will happen at all."
\'........................\'
"That island, which was the beginning of everything, will be the final destination of this journey.
 .........As your master, I must bring all of you witch\'s furniture with me...
...and I must return to the witch\'s island - to Rokkenjima."
Even though the rays of the sun had been so strong, at some point clouds had started to hang over us.
The spray hitting my cheek might not all be coming from the crashing waves.
"Ange-san.
 It looks like a light shower is coming.
 Shouldn\'t you be going down?"
Amakusa called out to me, with an expression of surprise that I was still here.
When I looked up, I saw that the island\'s silhouette had gotten much larger.
We might reach land very soon.
I remembered that the weather report had mentioned scattered rains.
The sky wasn\'t dark enough for rain clouds.
It\'ll probably be just for a short time.
Even if the rain was light enough not to be a bother,
 ......having rain start to fall as we approached the island felt like some kind of fate.
It was probably raining on October 4th, 1986, as well.
I was approaching the Rokkenjima of that day, ......and not just in distance......
I went back down with Amakusa.
Amakusa was carrying what looked like a quite large and heavy golf bag.
It was something Amakusa had brought back from god-knows-where after we split up for a day.
......I wasn\'t going to inquire as to its contents, but it\'s hard to imagine that they\'re anything peaceful.
".........I\'m deliberately not going to ask what\'s inside, but it looks heavy."
"Why is it that these are so heavy?
 A French instructor taught me something interesting about that once."
"He said that they should be heavy.
 .........After all, a human life is heavier than the Earth.
 So these should be even heavier."
".........It\'ll be nice if you don\'t have a chance to use them."
"That would be nice."
Amakusa set the golf-bag-like luggage down heavily beside him.
A two-propeller aircraft touched down on the runway.
With the weather in these conditions, it could not have been a pleasant flight.
Everything after this flight had been suspended due to the weather.
Cutting through the drizzle as she traversed the runway, Sumadera Kasumi entered the lobby with two black-suits as guards.
The four black-suits who had been waiting inside the lobby stood up and respectfully lowered their heads.
"""Kasumi-sama...!"""
"Propeller planes do shake awfully, don\'t they......
 I never want to fly in one again."
"We have a car prepared!
 Please, this way."
They went into two luxury cars that had been rented...
"......Ange should be heading for Rokkenjima.
 A deserted island - how truly convenient.
 .........You have prepared the tools, I hope?"
"Yes, ma\'am......!"
The black-suit in the passenger seat lifted a heavy bag that had been by his feet onto his lap,
 opened the zipper wide, and showed Kasumi the contents.
Inside were several blocky objects wrapped tightly in silver aluminum foil.
......He peeled one open to show her.
Out peeked a black, blunt, automatic pistol......
