It goes without saying, but since the time she was born, ......Jessica was raised in this mansion.
The Western-style house that the cousins simply called "the mansion" was her home.
And yet, she had never understood her cousins\' feelings as much as she did today.
......And at the same time, her own home, which she knew well, had never felt so different a place as it did now......
Her own.........room.
This had once been her personal hideaway, the only place in this vast mansion where she could feel at peace.
However, ......that door had never felt as intimidating as it did now.
".........A test, he says...?
 Tch, what the hell has he got waiting in there......
 He better not have ransacked my desk and stuff......"
She acted tough, trying to deceive herself.
......Trying to make herself believe that she wasn\'t scared of anything.
She readied herself, and opened the door to her room.
"...................................."
......When she saw that, fortunately, the room didn\'t appear to have been messed with, she relaxed.
No one......was there.
 ......Of course.
There was nowhere for anyone to hide here.
Right away, Jessica locked the door behind her.
......Now the room was safe.
She peeked under the bed and in the closet, but of course, no one was hiding.
"......Wh-......what the hell.
 ...Haha, ...haha...!"
She looked at the clock.
 ......Ten past eleven, or just a little past that.
As her tension lessened and fatigue came back to her entire body, she realized how messed up this whole day had been.
It was still only eleven.
......The plan had been for all the cousins to get together, have fun playing around, and talk animatedly about all kinds of things together into the night.
Normally, we would have been doing that kind of thing at this very moment.
Why has that......turned into this......?
".........It\'s all that old bastard\'s fault......
 ......How could he do that...to Mom......
to everyone........."
Her head was swimming with anger and sadness......
 But there was no one here to direct those emotions at.
......Because of the lock, this room\'s security was guaranteed.
Remembering that one more time, Jessica somehow regained her calm......
If it keeps up like this and nothing happens...
Jessica thought that she would like to go to the dining hall and see her mother\'s last face.
......Even though Gohda had emphasized so strongly that it was gruesome and that she definitely shouldn\'t look at it,
 even so, she wanted to see her mother\'s face one final time...
But they had been warned repeatedly that doing anything stupid would put the hostages in danger.
......Could it be that locking the door was also against the rules......?
If I close myself up in here, I alone might be saved.
......But if I don\'t open it, it will surely be against the rules, and Dad, Kanon-kun, Shannon, Auntie Kyrie, and Doctor Nanjo...
will be killed.
............There\'s no way the scales balance between five lives and my own one life.
Jessica tightly shut her eyes, resisting the other part of herself which said "Isn\'t it alright as long as I survive?",
 ......headed to the door, and made to unlock it.
......Just then.
Clap, clap, clap......
A crisp applause rang out, making Jessica\'s heart leap...
"If the door had remained locked, it might have been in violation of the rules, and harm could have come to the hostages.
 ......But even so, your own life might be saved."
"However, you resisted that temptation and were about to unlock the door yourself.
 That bravery of yours is worthy of admiration."
"Wh-who..............."
I, the owner of this room,
 ......had searched to make sure there was nowhere any human could have been hiding...
 .........Where had this...man...
.........There was nowhere for a Human to hide,
 ......but could something that wasn\'t Human have managed it.........?
I was pretty sure this was my first meeting with this largely built, middle-aged man.
 ......I did not recognize this guy, who looked like a butler and bore the seal of the One-winged Eagle.
"A pleasure to meet you, Jessica-sama.
 .........I serve as head furniture for the Master, the 27th of the 72.
 I am called Ronove."
"......Rono...ue......?
 ............Genji...san............?"
"......Ah, yes, ...Genji is like my little brother.
 Or perhaps he was my true form in this world.
 ......Perhaps you could even say he was a vessel."
".........What\'s...this guy...saying.........?"
"Oh, my apologies.
 This is not something that can be explained to a Human.
 .........Well then, let us move on to the main event."
"So this is that old crackpot\'s...
...test or whatever........."
"Correct.
 This is the test that the Master has granted you."
At Ronove\'s elegant gesture, like that of a butler ordering for the meal to be set out,
 many gold butterflies flew up out of nowhere......
"Gwah?!
 What the...hell......?!"
The swarm of gold butterflies spun around, forming a small swirl as they gathered in one place.
......Then, that golden mound disappeared like a pile of leaves blown away by a cold wintry wind,
 ......and there lay a Western envelope with the One-winged Eagle crest done on it in gold leaf......
Ronove gestured to her to pick it up.
Jessica timidly picked it up, and opened the letter inside......
".....................What is...this......?"
"It is an exceedingly simple test that looks for the qualifications for becoming the next head.
 ......Please attend to the question written there with the readiness of the next head who will bear responsibility for the Ushiromiya family,
 and tell me your answer, as well as the thoughts that led you to it."
"......Wh-............what the...utter hell..............."
Shaking, Jessica looked back and forth between the paper and Ronove\'s face several times......
......At that time, George, who had been called out after Jessica, could be seen in the arbor of the rose garden.
He had been planning to give Shannon the ring that would be proof of their engagement...here, tonight, at this time...if things had gone normally.
...But the woman in front of George now was not Shannon.
"......Read it.
 That is GOLDSMITH\'s test for you."
".............................."
George picked up the Western envelope on the table where he had once drunk tea with Shannon,
 and read its contents......
Perhaps its message was short.
 After a single glance at it, George\'s eyes grew sharp.
"............What is this...
supposed to be?"
"Ehheheheheh.
 ......It\'s what it looks like.
 This is the test given to you, to find if you have the qualifications to be the successor to the head.
 ......Ask yourself what makes you qualified to be the successor, as you answer the question."
".........What a...stupid question."
"I agree.
 It really is a stupid question.
 .........In that case, isn\'t the Ushiromiya family headship something just as trivial in GOLDSMITH\'s eyes?
 ......Heheheh."
George lowered his eyes to the surface of the letter once again, and examined its contents......
George and Jessica.
 ......While the tests given to them were slightly different, they were almost exactly the same.
"......\'Among the three mentioned below.
 In order to gain two, sacrifice one.\'"
"It\'s a simple three-choice test.
 .........Decide for yourself which one you will choose not to save."
"If you refuse to choose, the test is suspended.
 I have been given permission to kill you right here by my own hands.
 .........If you would include even that as a choice, then there are four choices."
"It\'s been an awful long time since I\'ve gotten to play with a kid like you, so I can\'t say I\'d be disappointed."
".........Are these three choices only a test?
 Or will the choice be accompanied by its result?"
"Don\'t be naive.
 ......The one you choose will definitely lose their life."
"......................................."
Among the three mentioned below.
In order to gain two, sacrifice one.
1. Your life
2. Shannon\'s life
3. Everyone else\'s lives
If you do not choose one, all of the above will be lost.
"...............Why is Shannon\'s name here?"
"The second choice has the name of the one most needed by that person, and most loved.
 ......I believe Kanon\'s name is written second on Jessica\'s test."
".........You gave this stupid question to Jessica too...?"
"*giggle*giggle*.
 ......What does Jessica matter?
 Right now, you are the one being tested."
"It really is a simple three-choice test.
 Which can you throw away for the sake of the other two?
 ......Isn\'t that simple?
 If you still can\'t decide, would you like me to lend you a coin......?"
"......A coin?
 How would you choose between three options with something that only has two sides?"
"There\'s no one who would throw away their own life.
 ......So naturally only two options remain.
 Will you give up on everyone for the sake of the one you love?
 Or will you give up on the one person you love so that you can save as many people as possible?"
"Either way, you can fit it with an appropriate just cause.
 After all, this Rokkenjima is now a demon island.
 ......The sickly sweet buddy-buddy pretense of the Human world is not necessary.
 No one will blame you.
 Do as your heart desires."
"......While asking yourself whether you possess the fitting qualifications to succeed the headship of the Ushiromiya family...
 No, make your decision as though you yourself are the Ushiromiya family head.
 Ehheheheheh......"
".........................................."
".........What.........the hell do you take me for............"
Jessica crumpled the letter up and threw it on the floor.
"I believe your anger is quite appropriate.
 ......I also find it an exceedingly pitiful, and truly ludicrous question.
 ......Pu ku ku ku."
"Like hell there\'s anyone who could wish for their own death.
 And...like hell there\'s anyone who could want to remain alive after abandoning the life of the person they l-...love.
 ......And......like hell there\'s anyone who could massacre everyone else......as long as it\'s good for the two of them......!"
"No, Jessica-sama.
 Such a person could exist."
"This is Rokkenjima, the demon island!
 It is now completely cut off from the Human world and dunked fully into the netherworld like cheese fondue.
 The values of the human world will be taken out with the trash."
"Pu ku ku!
 So please.
 Choose the things you desire from the bottom of your heart, in the order you desire them.
 Whatever remains will be your answer, and one most fitting for this insane night."
"Screw you!!
 How could I......choose any of these?!!"
"\'If you do not choose one, all of the above will be lost\'...
also makes for a fine fourth choice.
 It may also be interesting if that one is chosen."
"But since choosing that will result in the loss of your own life in the end, I believe it would be more wise to do the honorable thing and select number one, "your life",
 so that the other two will be saved.
 ......All is entrusted to your decision, Jessica-sama."
"Please, let me hear an answer and conviction fitting for the successor to the Ushiromiya family......!!
 I am sincerely hoping for a wonderful answer, fitting for the Master\'s descendant who shares his blood!!"
"Da-......damn iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiittt......"
That scene was being observed through a magic crystal ball being held by Kinzo.
Kinzo finally couldn\'t hold it back; spreading his arms and facing the heavens, he began laughing in an explosive voice......
"Fuhahahahahahaha, waahhahhahahahahahahahahaha!!
 Why do you hesitate, foolish grandchildren and descendants of mine!!"
"This is a simple problem that can be answered immediately!
 It should cause less vacillation than whether to put butter or jam on your morning toast!!
 ......Do you people know the correct answer?"
He turned and stared wide-eyed at the Chiester Sisters, who had been faithfully standing in wait behind him.
"N-no, no, my apologies, I don\'t know, Lord GOLDSMITH!"
"Fool, not choosing at all means GAME OVEEEEEEEEEEEER!!!
 You foolish rabbit, who cannot even choose a reason or a goal for her own life...!!"
"You have not the value of a single ant that anyone might step upon without even noticing!!
 Die! Be crushed!! Disappear faster than I can blink!!
 ......And what of you?"
"......I would sacrifice the first one, "my life", sir.
 Weapons exist to fight and die in battle.
 And weapons exist to destroy enemies and protect allies.
 If we can die protecting those we love, we can die satisfied, sir."
"Hoh.
 A truly splendid model answer for a weapon.
 The immediate reply is very nice.
 ......Have you been taught that you\'ll be given an extra carrot for answering that way?
 Heheheheh, that\'s not it, is it noowwwwww?
 Even that isn\'t it, is it nowwwwwwwwwww...?"
"You are merely answering the way you have been told to answer, repeating the answer you have been indoctrinated with!!
 You are the same as that other rabbit a second ago.
 You still live without having chosen a purpose or a goal to live for...!!
 Filth whose life has no value...!
 It would fit you well to crush you down and use you as fodder for the other livestock!!"
"...............
 ...Yes sir!
 A-animal fodder...would be an honor......!"
"I don\'t think sooooo!
 You don\'t want to see anyone else die anymore, doooo youuuu?
 Why can\'t you accept that?
 Accept that your old wounds are still festering and rotting deep, deep inside...!"
"Yes, the rotting stench almost makes the nose wrinkle, you foolish rotten rabbit!!
 These are words of praise for you!!"
".........Th-thank you very much...sir......"
"Well then, what about you, the last one.
 Which of the three choices would you choose...?"
"Nihi.
 Number two without hesitation."
"Hoh...
 Number two.
 There are not many who could proudly choose to offer "the one you love" as a sacrifice.
 Tell me your reason."
"Because the one you love will be lost eventually.
 If you don\'t have anyone to love, you won\'t be hurt, and even then, you still might be able to love someone again someday.
 So,
 the person you love right now isn\'t worth that much at all nyeh.
 ......Nihi!"
"*cackle*cackle*cackle*.
 I see, so that is why you reach such an answer, you rabbit who has become cowardly because you have been hurt by love......
 I have heard that rabbits die of loneliness, but just when was it that your heart was killed...?"
"Then, rabbit, I shall alter the question.
 Why don\'t I change the second option to, not "the one you love", but "the memories of the one you loved"."
"......How is that?
 Can you still select that one?
 What\'s this about the one you love not being worth much at all, foolish rabbit...!"
"Filth who cannot even face up to the depths of her own love!!
 Try and choose it, try and choose to have the one you loved forgotten!!!!!!"
"You can, right?
 I\'ll bet you can, riiiiiiiight?
 Cooooome onnnnn, try saying that you caaaaaaaaaaan!!!!"
"I, ...I, I can...
 I can...!!
 Nihi, .........nihihihihihihihihihiiihii......"
"L-Lord GOLDSMITH...!
 Please, have mercy on her......!!"
"Hihiiihiii...
 ......Hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiinn...!!"
"That is enough, rabbit filth!!
 Go to VIRGILIA and help keep watch on the dungeon.
 Begone!!"
The Chiester Sisters, their old emotional wounds gouged,
 disappeared as though running away.
After that, even though there was no one left to hear him, Kinzo continued talking as though continuing a play...
"......And there you have it, my pleasant test.
 To be truthful, there is no choice that can be said to be correct."
"Whichever answer they choose, it is about whether they can choose...
without hesitation,
 quickly,
 and with a resolute conviction and their own strong, unshakable will!!"
"The reason and their willpower are more important.
 .........That is what I want to know about.
 Ahhh, descendants of mine, I am truly looking forward to what kind of answers you will show me!!"
"............Hmmmm?
 Me?
 *cackle*cackle*cackle*!
 Yes, of course I once had the same question thrust upon me.
 Because I splendidly answered that devil\'s question, I was able to claim gold, honor, and that witch herself as my own."
"Which answer did I chooooose?
 .........Do I really need to say it out loud?
 Wahhahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha...!!!"
"So.
 Have you decided on your answer......?"
"................................."
As Jessica stared at the crushed letter which lay on the floor,
 ......she hung her head in constant silence.
All that filled the room was the sound of the wind and the rain, and the rustling of treetops.
Regardless of how noisy that was, it simply made the silence more apparent.
Ronove waited for Jessica\'s answer.
......However, Jessica didn\'t speak.
Whether she was deep in thought, or had stopped thinking, Ronove couldn\'t tell.
......No, ...he might actually have known.
But, cruelly like a demon, ......Ronove urged Jessica to voice it.
".........If you cannot choose any,
 ......I can at least take your life painlessly, ...if you would like......?"
".................................
 .........ll m."
"......What?
 I\'m afraid I had trouble hearing.
 May I ask you to repeat......?"
Jessica lifted her face, ......and looked straight into Ronove\'s eyes.
......It seemed that she had decided on her answer.
"............Kill me."
Jessica said it one more time, ......clearly.
Perhaps Ronove had imagined from the very beginning that this would be the answer.
......Without any surprise, he smiled lightly and nodded.
"......I thought that you would choose that answer, Jessica-sama.
 ......Now then, there is no right or wrong answer to this test.
 The important part is what thoughts led you to that answer."
"Come now.
 Please answer that with your readiness as the next head."
"............It\'s not like I chose the first one \'cause I wanted to die.
 ......The second one was letting Kanon-kun die.
 That\'s obviously out of the question.
 So forget that one.
 ......The third one was everyone else\'s lives.
 That\'s also obviously out of the question.
 So forget that one.
 ......After that, only the first choice remained."
"Process of elimination, ......is it.
 So it was not something you chose proactively, you say......"
After chuckling slightly, Ronove dropped his gaze.
......A Human couldn\'t even imagine what kind of answer a demon would have been hoping for.
......All she could understand was that this was apparently slightly below Ronove\'s expectations.
"......It\'s not a bad answer, but I must say, it\'s not a good one either.
 ......I suppose I would call it a 60.
 ......I\'m a little disappointed."
"You\'re a pretty selfish bastard, telling me to answer with self-confidence and then being disappointed when I do."
".........Apparently it was not only process of elimination.
 ...Either way, it is a failing grade, ......but it seems that there is a little more to your thoughts.
 Allow me to ask."
"I don\'t want to die.
 ......So I didn\'t want to choose the first one - no one would.
 ......People struggle as much as life will let them, \'cause they want to live in happiness.
 So normally, the first choice should be impossible from the beginning."
".........However, you took that first choice.
 You chose to throw away your own life.
 Only that choice remained."
"I tried......thinking of the future that would come after choosing each one."
"......Hoh.
 And what did you find...?"
"First, .........I tried letting Kanon-kun die.
 .........I tried to imagine the rest of my life after having abandoned the one I love."
"What kind of life was it...?"
"She was a horrible woman, who didn\'t deserve to live.
 A shabby woman who forever lamented her own decision, and lived only to regret.
 ......A horrible woman who would choose to live and abandon the person she loved... I could never forgive a woman like that.
 ......I\'d put an end to her myself."
"Heheh, how spirited.
 .........In that case, could you not also have considered the third choice?"
"......Yeah.
 I tried letting everyone but me and Kanon-kun die.
 ......There\'s no way Kanon-kun would like me if I did that."
"And it was no good for me either... Although I had Kanon-kun, all the lives I abandoned for that became a cross that I had to bear for my entire life.
 ......And even Kanon-kun was forced to bear that cross."
".........I\'m not going to make a foolish choice just to force a cross on Kanon-kun.
 If there\'s a future me out there who would do something like that, .........she\'s unforgivable to me.
 ...I\'d put an end to that woman myself too."
Jessica had pictured it in her mind.
The future her, beyond each of the three choices.
There were three Jessicas.
......Of the three, two had regrets.
Only one could hold her head high and smile at Kanon.
"......You know,
 I once had the nerve to preach something to Kanon-kun.
 ......Something about trying to live life to the fullest."
"Live your life to the fullest.
 ......Meaningful words.
 That is a surprisingly difficult thing to do."
"So yeah.
 I\'ve got to hold my head high and show Kanon-kun.
 .........Show him a way of living where you can hold your head high, and look anyone in the eye with a full and guiltless smile."
"......Will Kanon be able to receive your self-sacrifice?
 Haven\'t you considered that your self-centered decision might hurt him even more...?"
"That\'s why...I want to leave a message..."
"Hoh.
 ......I will listen, but I am after all a demon.
 ...I may not keep my promises..."
".........Keep it.
 Your promise."
Jessica spoke that looking quite unconcerned.
She had asked the demon who was about to take her life to pass on a message, and she wasn\'t thinking for a moment that she would be betrayed.
......At that extremely innocent smile, Ronove closed his eyes lightly, and shrugged his shoulders.
"Hmph......
 ......Very well.
 So?
 What shall I tell him...?"
\'......Tell Kanon-kun...to live his life to the fullest.
 ......No, that\'s not quite it.
 Not his life...not Kanon-kun\'s life.
 ......Even now I can\'t get him to tell me his real name,
 but tell him to live the real Kanon-kun\'s life to the fullest.
 .........Tell him that.\'
"...............Mi...lady......"
"......Jessica......
 ......You are unbelievable............"
"Ronove is fickle, so he might not have passed the message on.
 ......Aren\'t you lucky?
 To have me here showing you this scene."
A musty three-sided mirror was set beyond the bars, ......and the scene with Jessica was reflected on it.
On the next mirror...the scene with George was reflected in the same way.
None of them questioned how a three-sided mirror had appeared from a group of butterflies,
 or why Jessica and George were reflected on it.
......Because the reflected sights themselves were more important.
"............You are that prepared...
......to throw your life away,
 ......for his sake........."
".................................
 ......My......deepest apologies..."
Krauss looked at Kanon with a complicated expression that had an awkward smile mixed in.
......Kanon couldn\'t meet his eyes.
"......VIRGILIA-sama.
 ......There is no reason for Milady to lose her life.
 ......Please kill me.
 Please change it to the second choice.
 ......That way, everything should resolve itself."
"Hohhohohohohoho...
 I am not capable of granting that wish.
 ......After all, this is Jessica\'s own decision, which she chose."
Suddenly, the air split, and the Chiester Sisters appeared, flying into VIRGILIA\'s chest.
"VIRGILIA-samaaaaaaaaaaaa!
 Hiieeehheiiiiih!!"
"So mean, so mean, Lord GOLDSMITH is so meeeeeaan, wahhhnhaaaanhaahaahhhn!"
"I\'m......doing the best I can......
 Crushing me for animal fodder...that\'s just too much.
 ......Uuuuuuuughhuhhuu!!"
Still without a clue what was going on, VIRGILIA was smothered by the sobbing Chiester Sisters.
"Th-there, there. Everything\'s alright, it\'s alright. Don\'t cry, don\'t cry......
 I\'ll make you some delicious tea......"
"......I\'m leaving it up to all of you to guard this place.
 If they do anything suspicious, inform me immediately...!"
The goat attendants all looked at each other, and nodded their heads.
VIRGILIA took the Chiester Sisters and left.
The sound of people going up a set of stairs could be heard, so they had probably gone to an upper floor.
".........This is our chance.
 ......These goat-heads seem to be stupid.
 ......I wonder if we can trick them..."
Kyrie realized that an opportunity had arrived, but she still hadn\'t thought of a way to break the metal bars......
The Jessica reflected on the three-sided mirror closed her eyes, as though she had given up.
......The way she had both hands stuck into her pockets, wanting to be defiant until the very end, might have been her own kind of aesthetics.
"............That\'s all I want to say.
 .........Kill me."
"......Very well.
 ............Here we go, then.
 ......Do not worry, for I shall make your death more gentle and merciful than any sleep."
Ronove raised his palm......as he slowly approached Jessica......
"Dammiiiiiiiiiiittt!!
 Wrooggh!!
 Graaah!!"
Realizing that his daughter would be killed, Krauss repeatedly body-slammed the metal bars, going half-mad.
The goats looked like they were sneering at how a mere Human didn\'t stand a chance at breaking those bars.
And, true, Krauss\'s pointless effort might have been comical.
......But Krauss was giving it everything he had.
 As Jessica\'s father, he was living in that moment with everything he had, so that he could save her.
.........Kanon made tight fists with both hands.
If he used his cursed power, he might be able to cut through even metal bars.
......But there were a full three goats.
 ...There was no way he could defeat three of them in an instant.
 It would instantly be reported, and then VIRGILIA and even the Chiester Sisters would dash in.
Though he may be able to break the bars, ......he could do nothing more.
......It was useless.
......Kanon knew already that the witch was sneering at that kind of useless effort,
 ......so he could do nothing but stare at Krauss\'s repeated body-slams...
"......Ah, ............George-sama......"
Shannon, who had been looking at the three-sided mirror, let out a voice.
...They looked to see that George, who had been silent this whole time, had raised his head.
......It seemed that George had also decided on an answer...
"............Have you decided?
 Your answer?"
"Yeah.
 .........I\'ve decided."
"Is that an unwavering answer...?"
"Yeah. It\'s unwavering."
"Then let\'s hear it.
 .........Oh, by the way,
 it seems Jessica decided to take the "your life" option.
 I hope that an indecisive person like you won\'t simply say you chose the same answer......?"
"......Jessica gave her own answer.
 ......No matter which choice that was, it was Jessica\'s answer.
 It does not influence my answer in any way."
"I see.
 Then let me ask again.
 ............Among the three mentioned below.
 In order to gain two, sacrifice one."
"1. Your life.
 2. Shannon\'s life.
 3. Everyone else\'s lives.
 .........Which have you chosen?
 Could it be the first one, like Jessica?"
".........No."
"Oh......?"
Gaap looked a little surprised.
 ......Because she had thought that a timid-looking man like this would never choose any other option.
".....................
 ......That\'s nice to hear.
 I\'m glad the most boring option for me has been removed.
 ......Then, it seems unlikely, but......is it the second?
 Can you abandon Shannon\'s life......?"
".........You must be joking.
 Why would I do that to the person I\'m going to give an engagement ring to tonight?"
"........................
 .........Now this is bold.
 Is that your answer......?"
".........Yes.
 ......My answer...
...is the third choice."
George had chosen.........the third choice.
......"Everyone else\'s lives".
Even Gaap hadn\'t been able to imagine that answer.
......She had been sure that he\'d choose number one, just like Jessica......
So, she became interested in how he had reached that answer.
......How he had reached an answer that had defied the imagination of the 33rd ranked demon of the 72.
"I want you to tell me.
 .........Tell me the perspective that makes you able to sacrifice the lives of everyone else so that you and the fiancee you love will be safe.
 ......Process of elimination, like Jessica?"
"No.
 This is the clear and only choice for me."
"...............So it\'s "I\'m alright, Jack"?
 You can sacrifice the world for the woman you love...?"
"Just what are you talking about?"
"............What.........?"
George faced the demon as he spoke, looking at her almost in disbelief.
"......Tonight,
 I planned on calling Shannon to this very spot, and giving her this ring as proof of our engagement."
".........There probably are quite a few people who wouldn\'t celebrate an engagement between me and Shannon.
 I was prepared to make enemies of the entire family by announcing my engagement to her."
"I have been prepared.
 Since the time I came to this island, .........no, that\'s not it.
 .........Since the time I confessed to her that I wanted us to get engaged."
"............So, you can sacrifice everything else as long as you can get married......?"
"Marriage...
...means remaining an ally to your wife for your entire life.
 .........As of that moment,
 ......I was prepared to make the entire world my enemy for her sake."
Those words, through the three-sided mirror, ......also reached Shannon\'s ears.
And his determination reached her eyes.
......Shannon certainly had arranged with George that tonight, she would be given an engagement ring.
Then this incident had occurred, and she hadn\'t been able to receive the ring.
But now,
 .........even though it wasn\'t in the form of a ring,
 ......Shannon had received something even greater.
......And as proof of that,
 ......a single tear with the same sparkle as a diamond...
dripped down.
"Heh, ......heheheheheheh......!
 What a gutsy answer.
 .........Yes, if I really think about it, this was an easy decision for you."
"After all, your parents were already killed on the first twilight, right?
 By now, there\'s no one whose death would bother you.
 Hahhahahahahahaha, I see, this was an easy choice.
 Ahahahahahahahaha......"
"You can say whatever you want.
 This is my determination and my choice, ......personally, and as the next family head."
The sparkle in George\'s eyes was brilliant and sharp.
...For just an instant, Gaap felt the same sense of intimidation that Kinzo exuded, and was slightly overpowered.
".........I see.
 ......So, the same answer as GOLDSMITH......
 ......Despite your innocent face, ......you\'re going to become a terrible demon in the future.
 ......What do you know, we might get along pretty well."
"You will succeed GOLDSMITH.
 And maybe one day, I may even be summoned eventually and serve you.
 ......That might be surprisingly interesting.
 .........Heheh."
Gaap needed to change her opinion of George.
......This man bore a determination and resolve unimaginable from his outward appearance, and had not adopted that just now,
 ......but had possessed it since the very beginning.
"I am prepared to inherit the headship right away.
 .........No, that\'s not it.
 You told me to think as the head in this test.
 So I answered based on the premise that I am the head."
".........No, even that\'s not it.
 I thought as the head himself.
 ......Right now...I am the head of the Ushiromiya family."
".......................................
 Ehheheheheh......
 I\'m impressed... I didn\'t expect you to be able to say so much."
"It seems you really are one to be reckoned with.
 ......Battler\'s and Maria\'s tests haven\'t been done yet, but if you ask me, I think you should be the one to pass.
 ............But only if that is your true, unexaggerated answer, of course?"
"............Do you doubt my resolve?"
"Can you carry out the choice you chose?
 Can you, right now, with your own hands, offer all the lives that exist on this island as sacrifices......?
 With your own hands, I remind you...?"
"I can.
 I\'ve said several times that I have that resolve."
"Ha, ............hahahahahaha!
 Then return to the guesthouse right away, and kill Battler and Maria!
 When that is done, I will bring you the other hostages.
 Execute each of them except Shannon before her eyes!
 You can do it, right?!"
"I can.
 My resolve is on a whole different level from yours."
"...........................mngh.
 Then carry it out!
 Death for them all!
 Carry out this blood-stained ritual as the new head of the Ushiromiya family...!!"
"......Understood.
 I\'ll carry it out.
 I am already the head of the Ushiromiya family."
"Yes, that\'s right!
 Stain that throne red by your own hands...!
 You will become king of the netherworld, ruler of all demons...!!"
Gaap was now sure.
This man was truly fitting to succeed Kinzo\'s madness...!
"Rage on, storm! Cry out, thunder!!
 Celebrate the birth of the new demon king!!
 The island of demons has now welcomed a new ruler...!!"
In response to the demon\'s call, the tempest raged more and more.
Then a massive lightning bolt fell, its tearing thunder and brilliant light creating the feeling of just a moment of silence......
"So,
 ............about the order of the murders.
 I get to choose, right?"
"Please, as you wish, Your Majesty, the new demon king of Rokkenjima.
 As your heart desires...!"
".........Well, for lack of a better option...
the first one will be you, then - I hope that won\'t be a problem?"
"..............................Huh?"
A gust of wind blew, ......stirring up George\'s jacket as though it was a cloak.
It was very much like the cloak worn by the head.
It definitely gave the same impression of grandeur......
......At that time, ......Gaap certainly saw the storm wiped away, and the sky covered with a pure-white and vast full moon.
Bearing the full moon on his back,
 the man who called himself the new head...
sneered at the demon.
"Even the lives of the Ushiromiya family, all of them......are now my fortune.
 There will be reparations to be made for the damage that has been done to that fortune.
 It won\'t be cheap."
"......You didn\'t seriously think you could take the lives of my parents, Aunt Natsuhi, Uncle Rudolf, Auntie Rosa,
 and Genji-san, and hope I\'d overlook it, right?"
"Ho...
......hohoh...
............you little wise guy......"
Ronove had been intending to press his palm against Jessica\'s chest and stop her heart.
But a short distance away, his hand had stopped......
......On the carpet at their feet,
 ......plop, plop...small red flowers bloomed one after another.
The seeds of those flowers...
...had fallen down from high, high above,
 .........all the way from Jessica\'s fist,
 ...held up as though to strike the heavens.
Ronove\'s nose was stained red with spurting blood,
 ......and those drops were dripping onto the carpet.
".........By the way, that just now was my answer as a maiden.
 ......My answer as the next head is different."
"Allow me to ask......"
"......The person I love, my family and my relatives, everyone, everyone!!
 I\'ll protect them.
 If I\'m the head, then that\'s my duty!"
"Dad wasn\'t just acting self-important.
 He was protecting me and Mom!!
 ......Fighting the pressure of succeeding the Ushiromiya family......for several decades!!"
"So I know.
 ......Being the successor is nothing trivial.
 ......So you know what?
 This is easy as hell.
 ......It\'s easy as hell for me to risk my own life!!"
Jessica knew.
She knew that her father, in order to protect his family, was even now bluffing and fighting a solitary fight.
Jessica understood something that his back had been telling her!
Another left straight was buried into Ronove\'s face.
......That mighty strike wasn\'t due just to the brass knuckles she was using.
It was a strike...
of a person, a family head, who could throw away everything in order to protect.
"If Dad\'s lost his qualifications to be the successor,
 then I, the next in line, will succeed the headship.
 ......Head of the Ushiromiya family, Ushiromiya Jessica!!
 I\'m not enough of a wimp to let you keep on doing whatever the fuck you want!!"
"............A wonderful answer.
 I shall change your score from earlier.
 Plus 10 for that answer.
 ......Plus 10 for that splendid left straight."
"Which means I only need plus 20 more for a perfect 100?"
Ronove backflipped away from her, and violently wiped away the blood pouring from his nose.
......It had become, not blood, but petals of a red rose.
The blood on his face was wiped off, ......and in its place...
was a grin from a great delight, which he had last felt so many centuries ago that he could no longer remember just how long it had been.
"Your resolve.
 I, Ronove, will test to see whether it is deserving of full marks......"
"Cram it, jackass!!
 Come at meeeeeeeeeeeee!!!"
"Come, to the Abyss...!"
"Wwagh?!"
Beneath George\'s feet, a pitch-black pit suddenly opened its mouth wide.
Of course, George had no way of resisting.
After being swallowed up by it, George fell out of a pitch-black hole that had opened up in the ceiling of the arbor.
As George fell down,
 he was hit sharply in the gut, like a precision bee-strike, by a reverse roundhouse kick from a stiletto heel...!
Launched out of the arbor, the instant George thought that he was about to be swallowed up by a rose bush...
...another pitch-black hole opened there and swallowed George up.
And this time, a pitch-black hole opened in front of Gaap at her feet, spitting a defenseless George out of it.
......By that time, Gaap had already finished the preparatory motions for the next reverse roundhouse kick.
"Ghh, ......what is......this..."
"Welcome back. *giggle*!"
Right side of the head.
 Below the right armpit.
 Side of the right knee.
As Gaap danced and spun like a small cyclone,
 she kept hitting him, right foot left foot right foot left foot, with successive roundhouse kicks.
The fourth one became a sweep, cutting George\'s feet out from under him and making him fall down,
 but of course, there was no floor there, but a pitch-black hole, and George was swallowed up once again.
Gaap once again spun around like a small cyclone.
George, likewise, was once again spat out from the ceiling of the arbor.
".........Take this and keep it as a memento, the single strike at the end of the Abyss.
 ......Die......!!"
The sharp strike of the queen bee pierced the heavens like a rising cyclone.
It kicked through George\'s abdomen as he fell from the ceiling......
And then, ......time froze.
 George was pinned in midair by Gaap\'s raised leg......
"Gah, .........mmph........."
Still pinned in midair, George moaned......
Then Gaap, with George still hung up on her foot,
 ......grinned.
".........I\'ll admit it.
 Your attitude at least is mature.
 But that\'s no good if it doesn\'t come along with power."
"......Did you know?
 They say you need three kinds of power to rule this world.
 The first is influence.
 The second is wealth.
 Do you know what the last one is?"
"I read it in a book.
 ......Force, right......?"
"Correct.
 That is what you are lacking."
Gaap finally released George.
By kicking him upwards one more time, adding in another roundhouse kick and smashing him into a pillar.
"Ghh? ......Ung...uhhhgh......!"
"No one will fear a monarch without influence, without wealth, or without force."
"Kinzo possessed all three.
 That is why he reigned as a tyrant!
 ......If you\'re going to call yourself Kinzo\'s successor, try showing me some of his majesty!"
"......Come on, how long are you going to lie there?
 Stand up.
 If you don\'t, you\'ll fall again, see?"
"Pu ku ku ku.
 Not bad movements.
 But I feel they are somewhat unsuitable for a lady."
"Asshooooooooole!!
 Ducking and weaving and hopping around!!
 Aren\'t you gonna fight back......?! Quit jerking me around, you douche!!"
Ronove was dodging skillfully, jumping back, and avoiding Jessica\'s fists,
 but he still wasn\'t striking back himself.
Because of his agile movements, as swift as a flag whipping around in strong winds, Jessica\'s fist wasn\'t even able to touch him.
Amidst a feeling of her blood running hot, Jessica regained her offensive composure.
Even though this room was large for a bedroom, it was too small an area to keep up such exaggerated dodges for long.
......She calmly realized that, and started using not just her fists, but her legs as well.
"......Hoh.
 ......Doing boxing with just your arms makes you but half a man.
 Your arms must be the roaring lion, burning with power.
 And your legs the snake, cold as ice as it closes in on its prey."
"Snakes don\'t have legs!"
"Pu ku ku, very true."
Jessica began cornering Ronove towards the wall with perfect footwork.
 She wouldn\'t let him get around her.
......Ronove\'s magnificent dodges looked flashy, but they needed sufficient room.
Once cornered, he wouldn\'t be able to dodge anymore...!
Jessica had a good understanding of the special characteristics of her equipped weapon, the brass knuckles.
This powerful weapon\'s most notable characteristic was how it didn\'t let the opponent defend.
Even if they blocked with their arm, that arm would receive direct damage.
......If it hit the wrong way, it might even break the bone.
So she pressed him forward.
 She would block off his escape routes, ......and then, with this fist, she would chip this demon down!!
"Whoops...!
 Oh my, when did...?"
"Looks like I\'ve finally cornered you, huh......?
 Where is everyone being held?
 Where\'s that old bastard hiding?
 You tell me everything, and I\'ll let you go with nothing more than ripping that mustache off, alright?"
"That would be a problem.
 Believe it or not, it does take me an hour every morning to set this, you see."
"If I put you in a plaster cast, I guess you won\'t even be able to do that!"
"............Oops-a-daisy.
 .....................gggh."
Ronove had blocked Jessica\'s lunged fist with his arm.
He tried to act as though it was no big deal, but it must have hurt a lot.
......Jessica grinned.
Ronove smiled the same way, but twitched slightly.
"......I see.
 This certainly does hurt."
"Final warning.
 Break down and apologize."
"That, I cannot do.
 It would ruin my image."
"Then just break.
 Flurry of puncheeeeeeeees!!!"
Jessica\'s iron fists were pounded into Ronove.
But Jessica was startled - the impact felt wrong, and there was the sound of breaking glass.
"Wh-......?!"
At a glance, it looked like Ronove had caught Jessica\'s fist with his palm.
 ......That wasn\'t quite true.
When Ronove opened his hand, a faint purple glowing barrier like a glass shield appeared there,
 stopping the attack by a hair\'s breadth.
Pulling herself together, Jessica struck out with her fists again, but with truly magnificent movements, Ronove caught all of them......
"I am, after all, a demon.
 I am at least capable of this level of magic.
 .........I must say, though, you are quite good.
 If I were a Human, I am sure that this is where I would have admitted defeat.
 It is because I am a demon that I can still continue to fight."
"Y-......you frigging cheater.........!"
"Is that all?
 ......Are you sure that by attacking all the time, you are not neglecting your own defense?"
"Huh?!"
"......Waaah!!"
Ronove pounded his palm into Jessica\'s stomach, stopping abruptly just a fraction away.
Jessica was repelled by the purple shield, tumbled backwards, and smashed her head on the bed.
"My shield cannot be broken by a mere Human.
 I suggest that you never again dream of being able to touch my body."
"......In that case, ......I\'ll just punch straight through that shield......!!"
"You are a dauntless person.
 That tenacity...yes, it is truly fitting for the next family head.
 ......Why don\'t I be your opponent for just a while longer.
 This is one of the privileges of an examiner.
 .........Pukkukukukukuku!"
"SHATTER TO PIECEEEEEEEES, IIIAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHH!!"
Gaap looked down on George, sneering.
He was lying face-down in a puddle on the rose garden path.
The merciless rain beat down on him, so that it looked as though even the heavens were mocking him...
".........Ahhahahahahahaha.
 Stand up.
 You\'ll fall again."
"..........................."
George stood up shakily.
......It seemed his spirit hadn\'t given in, but the damage to his body was fairly significant.
"Beg for your life.
 What you\'re doing now is the same as the fourth choice of choosing nothing.
 ......You chose the third choice, right?
 If you get down on your hands and knees and apologize, I\'ll forgive your rudeness towards me."
"Then, I\'ll guide you down to the dungeon.
 There, for your beloved Shannon and your own powerless self, you will kill the other hostages one by one."
"......You can do it, right?
 You did boast about having that resolve.
 ......Heheheheheh."
George didn\'t answer.
......But his gaze was still obstinately resisting surrender.
"......If you are too obstinate, then this time you really will fall to the deepest depths of the Abyss...
 *cackle*cackle*cackle*."
Gaap\'s strength was undeniable.
......There was no doubt that Shannon\'s group, watching through the three-sided mirror, understood that - 
probably even more clearly than George himself...
".........George-sama......
 ......Please,
 ......that\'s enough.........
 ...You don\'t have to do this for someone like me......"
"Nee-san......"
"......If you didn\'t fall in love with me,
 ......you wouldn\'t have to fight with anyone, right, George-sama...?
 Then please, just abandon me......
 Please, forget me......"
There was no way for that voice to reach George.
......But, even so,
 ......George answered.
"No way.
 ............I won\'t...surrender."
"......Oh?
 Why......?"
"............Because that...is my...resolve.
 ......I\'ll fight everything for Shannon\'s sake.
 And I\'ll make everything accept us,
 ......and everything bless us."
"Hey, tell me something.
 How can you go so far for that furniture called Shannon?
 .........She\'s just a good-for-nothing, isn\'t she?
 Furniture for the garbage that doesn\'t even make for a satisfactory waitress."
"............I won\'t permit any more insults against the woman I love."
"So what are you going to do about it?
 How is a weak kiddo like you going to fight against me...?"
"Loving someone is strength.
 ......I was able to become strong because I learned that feeling.
 .........\'Shannon,
 I love you.\'
 With just those words, I can stand back up, over and over again."
"Shannon\'s in the dungeon, you know?
 No good professing your love to me."
"No.
 She heard.
 ......Because that is love.
 Shannon can hear my words right now.
 The reason I can believe that...is because of love."
"..................This guy... ......"
\'Shannon.
 You are not furniture.
 ......Even if you were, you would be mine alone, the only furniture for me in the world.
 I want you to be close to me all my life.
 ......I need you...always and forever.\'
".........G-......George-sama..............."
"......I\'m jealous.
 He\'s surpassed my husband in smooth talking."
"Th-......this is youth."
"Ahhahahahahahahahahaha...!!
 Love is strength?
 Then why are you so weak, boy?
 It must mean your love is also that weak, then, I guess?"
"*snicker*snicker*!
 Your love for your fiancee is weak.
 Your parents\' disappointingly quick deaths were weak.
 Everything about your life is weak."
"...............Shannon taught me about love and strength.
 If you insist upon measuring my love for Shannon by my strength alone,
 ......then let me teach you about my love."
"*chuckle*, nice words.
 ......Nowww I get it.
 So you say that the way you can still stand up after being kicked down so many times is the strength you received from Shannon.
 In that case, what did you receive from your mother and father, who were killed without a fight?
 .........?"
Suddenly, there was a blackout.
 ......Outside?
".........N-......no.
 .........Th-...this is............"
The thing blocking Gaap\'s vision...
............was the bottom...
of George\'s...
...
shoe...
"............Side kick.
 Nasal bone fractured."
It had stopped right in front of the tip of Gaap\'s nose.
"The thing I got from Mother was this kick."
After several moments\' delay, Gaap jumped back.
 Of course, it was too late.
If George hadn\'t stopped, he probably would have caused exactly the damage he had announced.
"And what I got from Father...
...is patience."
Anger with a low boiling point isn\'t something to be truly feared.
......True anger is cultivated through patience.
".........I understand your declaration of violent intent.
 ......I also understand your defamation of my fiancee and my parents.
 And you have no intention of retracting any of these......?"
"......Y-you......"
"I have a sufficient understanding of your attacks now.
 ............If you\'re ready...may I fight back?"
"E-enough of your slick talk, bucko......!!"
A pitch-black hole opened its mouth at George\'s feet.
But George rapidly opened his legs, straddling the hole.
 The same move wouldn\'t work again...!
It was an extremely light dodge, and the upper part of his body didn\'t even quiver.
"Patience means not losing your cool, and instead composedly researching your opponent\'s moves.
 .........For what purpose?
 Isn\'t it obvious?
 Do you know?"
"N-n-no I don\'t......"
"It\'s to counter, to give back exactly what you got, to make them never want to mess with you again,
 to make them cover their face in tears and snot and forget to wipe it off,
 to make them want to rub their forehead on the ground and apologize over and over - to completely, perfectly, thoroughly...!!!
 ......Pulverize them until they can\'t get up."
George dashed.
Pits opened one after another, but George would not step in them again.
And because she persisted in that move, Gaap was captured for a second time...
".........Reverse roundhouse.
 Jaw fractured."
"...............!"
It was stretched out more forcefully and beautifully than Gaap\'s had been.
Of course, while it centered directly on Gaap\'s face, it stopped a hair\'s breadth away.
Perhaps she couldn\'t rely on pitfalls at this close range.
Gaap kicked at George\'s shins as a diversion,
 and in the instant of weakness when he tried to deal with that, she aimed a kick at his stomach.
It was a bee-like stab by her stiletto heel.
......But it sliced through the air where George was no longer.
".........High axe kick.
 Collarbone fractured."
"............wh-uh - "
From beside Gaap,
 George coldly announced that, his foot still raised.
If that monarch\'s heel had been swung down, a collarbone fracture would have been an understatement.
"This guy\'s...
......stronger than me...at close range......?!
 Need distance......"
She jumped backwards to gain a large distance.
She jumped and jumped and leapt and even backflipped, increasing the distance between them.
It should have been magnificent, but for some reason, it looked very similar to the movements of a small, scared animal.
If she opened the distance, she could fight at the range that was her specialty, using a mixture of pitfalls and kicking techniques...!
"You fool... Regret the arrogance of passing on three chances to defeat me, in the depths of the Abyss!!
 ..................Huh?"
Gaap landed beautifully and tried to aim a pitfall,
 when a razor-sharp wind cut her bangs.
 ...Yes, cut them.
And twice.
 ......This time it didn\'t just stop a hair\'s breadth away, but scattered her bangs with its air pressure......
".........Armada com martelo.
 ......Orbital blowout fracture with the first strike.
 Cerebral contusion with the second strike."
".................. -  -  - ...!!!"
Gaap was too shocked to speak.
George had closed all that distance in an instant, and let off a fearsomely nimble midair double kick.
......Furthermore, with the accuracy and edge of a razor, it had cut nothing more than a few of her bangs.
"I learned the power of kicks from karate,
 speed from tae kwon do,
 and freedom of range from capoeira."
"......Mother was always trying something new.
 But it was very educational being able to study their various merits."
"Wh-......why don\'t you hit......?
 ......Because I\'m a woman?!!"
"......You spoke of force as a monarch\'s third power."
"It looks like you\'re still mistaking the meaning of that force.
 ......In this situation, force doesn\'t mean hastily wielded violence.
 .........It refers to a deterrent - the knowledge that if someone opposes the monarch, that person won\'t get away unharmed."
"A deterrent......?"
That was the point.
 That was why all of George\'s attacks up until then had stopped just before the blow.
These bare misses, which were more difficult than hitting directly, had all been performed so splendidly.
...And any one of them would probably have crushed Gaap in a single hit, if George had wished it.
He was - deliberately - not doing that.
"You said it yourself, right?
 Force is the power to rule.
 .........If you destroy your opponent with force, you won\'t be able to rule them, right?"
"A monarch\'s force is something that is only shown.
 He does not destroy.
 ......He makes others submit, and adds them to his own fortune.
 If you black out on me, I won\'t be able to make you guide me to where everyone is being held."
Gaap had to admit it.
She had to admit that George understood force in the truest sense...!
"You\'ll take me to where everyone is.
 I would advise against resisting.
 .........I won\'t hold back anymore."
"...khh...!!
 .........Sorry, Lia... Lemme borrow your troops.
 This guy\'s too much for me alone to handle!!"
As a large, pitch-black hole opened in the sky,
 thunk, thunk, thunk - three muscular goat attendants fell out.
 They surrounded George.
".........Reinforcements?
 I wonder if I should take this to mean that you retract your statement about me being weak."
"I, ......I admit it.
 ......I made light of your power...the power of Humans......"
"No.
 This is the strength of a man who has come to know love."
"Wh-what tripe... How can you say stuff like that with a straight face?!!
 Come, goats!
 Crush this man into meatballs!"
"Heheheh, these goats are stupid, but it looks like they at least have power.
 I\'ll make it so that even your fiancee won\'t be able to recognize your corpse!"
"You refuse to surrender and intend to continue fighting. Understood.
 ......I proclaim that henceforth, you will receive real harm proportional to your own attacks."
"If you still plan on attacking me, I suggest you prepare to receive a great deal of damage."
When George proclaimed that,
 ......a faint red magic circle rose up around him.
But it seemed that George couldn\'t see it.
However, Gaap, being a demon, could.
"M-......magic?!
 Why does this guy have a defensive barrier...?!
 And what\'s more, it\'s......specialized for counterattacks...?!
 Is this......wh-what you meant by a deterrent......?!"
From a demon\'s perspective, that might have been magic.
But in George\'s eyes, it was...determination.
It was absolute determination that would show no mercy to anyone who wished for further fighting,
 and force them to prepare for a significant counterattack.
 Absolute determination...becomes magic.
Ronove had been accurately blocking Jessica\'s fists with the shield.
 ......But something felt odd.
Even though he was certainly stopping the blows with the shield,
 he felt his arm beginning to strain and ache.
All physical damage should have been shut off.
......However, the damage from her fists was gradually being transmitted to his arm, and was accumulating.
Ronove acted like he was composed, so that this wouldn\'t be noticed...
"Heh, heheh...!!
 I\'m not gonna get worn out.
 What\'s wrong, old man?
 Starting to get a little tough...?!"
"......No matter how much you attack, it is useless.
 Why can\'t you understand that you cannot break my shield?"
"Saying that is not gonna stop me hitting you.
 ......No matter how hard someone\'s heart is, words are gonna get through to them a little bit each time, and eventually, you can make a crack...!
 I believe it!!
 I believe that there\'s no such thing as useless effort in this world!!"
"Isn\'t that why we live?! To the fullest!!
 If words get through eventually, then the same goes for fists...!!
 I don\'t even know the meaning of the words "give up"!!"
Those words were probably aimed at Kanon...
 Kanon had, technically, rejected Jessica\'s words.
 ......But Jessica knew that, no matter how obstinate his heart was, those words would eventually soak through.
And she believed that surely, the day would come when he would understand her heart, and stop calling himself furniture and disparaging himself,
 ......and step out into his new life.
So Jessica wouldn\'t give up.
 She wouldn\'t lose heart...!
"Sounds dumb as hell, huh?
 I\'ll bet it makes no sense to a guy like you, does it?
 See, a girl in love...doesn\'t even think about "giving up because it\'s useless"!!"
At that time, Ronove certainly saw.
He saw the red-hot burning glow of light surround Jessica\'s fists.
".........This is......problematic.
 ......Enchanted, are they?
 ...Permeation upgrade......that will be troublesome."
Within her relentless fists and determination...dwelled the power to succeed no matter what.
From a demon\'s perspective, that was magic.
 Absolute determination...becomes magic.
"See?
 Nothing useless about it.
 ...My fists are making it through, aren\'t they?
 You\'re guarding your arm, old man."
"...............It seems I will have to get a little more serious.
 ...It appears it is as you said.
 ......In this world, nothing is useless."
"That\'s right...!
 If you give up saying something\'s useless, that\'s when your life is frigging over...!
 I\'ll get through to him.
 ......Definitely...!!"
I\'m an idiot, so this is the only way I can live,
 but even so, ......I believe that one day,
 I\'ll definitely be able to teach Kanon-kun about a new world!!
So I\'m not gonna buckle in a place like this...!!
I\'ll definitely defeat you,
 and save everyone!!
"Dammit!!
 If I could just...open a hole......aaaaaaaargghhh!!!"
Krauss was repeating his useless effort in trying to somehow open a hole between the metal bars.
......Useless.
 .........There\'s nothing useless.
There\'s nothing...
The lookout goats had been swallowed up by those black pits and disappeared.
......Now was their do-or-die chance.
This was their only chance to break the bars......
"S-stop it, it\'s impossible, Krauss-san!
 We can\'t do anything about them with our bare hands!
 Let\'s look for a tool, don\'t waste time on the impossible...!"
"If you give up saying it\'s useless, then it\'s all over...that\'s what my daughter said.
 ......Even if it\'s impossible for my body, as long as a small person like Shannon or Kanon could make it through......!!"
"......At this stage, action is more important than racking our brains.
 Let\'s put our strength together, I\'ll join in too...!
 ......Kanon-kun, you\'re a boy, lend a hand...!
 ......Kanon-kun?!"
"............Krauss-sama.
 Please stand back."
"What?
 What are you thinking of......?"
"......It\'s alright, isn\'t it, Nee-san?
 .........If we try struggling...just one more time."
"............Yeah.
 ......I\'ll...struggle once more as well.
 ......No, not once.
 ...Over and over again."
Jessica\'s voice had reached Kanon.
It had certainly permeated into his stone-cold heart.
And George\'s voice had reached Shannon.
 If the love he had shown was embodied by strength, she would have to respond in the same way.
An incredible metallic sound rang out.
.........The first flash cut horizontally through several of the metal bars, and with the next flash, they were cut through horizontally again,
 causing them to clatter to the ground like bamboo shoots cut by a sword.
Krauss, Kyrie, and Nanjo didn\'t even have a clue about what had just happened......
"......Doctor Nanjo.
 Which way down the corridor goes to the mansion......?"
"Y-.........yes!
 It\'s to the left at the back...to the left at the back......!"
"Let\'s go, everyone.
 ......We\'ll be noticed by VIRGILIA-sama any time now."
"You two...
......what in the world are you......?"
"............We\'re......"
When Kanon hung his head a little and faltered, Shannon slapped his shoulder, smiled, and spoke.
"We are Human."
"V-VIRGILIA-sama!!
 Response from warning network, jailbreak!
 The goat guards aren\'t there for some reason...!!"
"......Whaaat?! Why?!
 ...............It\'s Gaap, isn\'t it.
 Taking my summons without asking!!
 ......Gap!
 Gapgap!!"
"......Confirming Rules of Engagement.
 Request permission to fire at the escapees, ma\'am."
"Do it...!
 Kill them! Kiiiiii!!
 Gapgapgap,
 gab,
 gya!!!"
"Understood, ma\'am.
 45, 410, preparing for sniping pursuit combat.
 Ammo type: Guided cluster rounds.
 ......VIRGILIA-sama, the escape prevention barrier."
"Owowowow......
 Y-yes, right.
 Hohhoho, I won\'t let you escape from here.
 ......Owow, bit my tongue saying Gapgap..."
As they ran down the underground passage, the path in front of them was once again blocked by metal bars.
 The door was, of course, locked.
......However, that was no problem for them now.
"Kanon, more metal bars!
 We need you...!"
"Yes, Krauss-sama...!"
"......That is incredible, though.
 ...I wonder if you could tell me what kind of principle it works on."
"I\'m not interested in principles.
 The only thing that\'s important is that he can sever the metal bars, and we can escape from here...!
 Don\'t get distracted, Kanon, just do it!"
"Leave it to me......!"
Kanon sliced the metal bars again with a red trail.
 But there was a harsh, strange noise, and only a slight scratch was left on the metal bars.
"G-goodness,
 ......these are sturdy......"
"No.
 ......It\'s enchanted!
 It\'s VIRGILIA-sama\'s magic lock."
"Can you cut through it?"
"Of course.
 But it will take time."
"I\'ll give you three minutes...!"
After taking a deep breath and focusing his concentration, Kanon once again extended his sword that trailed red.
When he pressed it hard against the metal bars, sparks sprayed, almost as though he was burning through them with a blowtorch.
"It looks like cutting it is possible, ......but it\'s going to make us work for it."
".........Krauss-sama.
 We\'ve been locked on to by the enemy.
 Please move back."
"Huh?
 Pursuers?
 There\'s no one coming!"
"Please get behind me.
 They\'re aiming for us...!!"
"45, data received.
 Targets acquired. Correcting for terrain.
 Forming firing curve, control points adjusted.
 Data link to 410."
"410, data received.
 Checking danger zone, no problems."
"00, loading 48 sub-rounds, individual homing F&F.
 Guided cluster rounds: ready."
"45, firing preparations complete.
 Guided cluster rounds: loaded."
"410, nihhihihihi!
 Firiiing!!"
A golden arrow that sparkled gold was fired, leaving a gold tail streaming behind.
It drew a curve, went through the door, through the keyhole, down the stairs, towards the underground path at full speed......!
"S-something shone!!"
"......You can\'t block the golden arrow with a shield.
 Kanon-kun, prepare to intercept.
 Let\'s link."
"Gatekeeper, understood.
 .........It\'s been a long time since I\'ve fought alongside you, Nee-san.
 Don\'t screw up."
"Yeah.
 I\'ll give it everything I\'ve got."
"Then we\'ll be fine!"
Kanon stopped cutting the bars, and stood in front of Shannon.
Behind him, Shannon closed her eyes, concentrating her mind, focusing deep, deep into the darkness of the underground path......
A guided cluster round is a special kind of arrow made up of 48 sub-rounds bound together.
It explodes mid-flight and divides into 48 mini-arrows.
The strength of each individual one is low, but they pierce through all shields and possess total lethality against ground troops.
And on top of that, each one of the 48 possesses autonomous guidance towards their individual targets.
".........It shone.
 ...It\'s divided..."
"Checking guided cluster round division.
 46...7...8, ...48 sub-rounds, all locks acquired.
 Interception control. Data link to Kanon."
"Kanon, data received.
 ......Your ability is incredible, Nee-san.
 I can \'see\' all 48."
"Observe the interception priority ordering.
 Trust your nee-san."
"Of course.
 I don\'t even need to open my eyes."
"Commence interception."
"T-targets unharmed!!
 I-it was intercepted...!!"
"Nihyah?!
 All 48?!"
"Hoh-hoh-ho......
 Shannon and Kanon were originally a furniture pair, you see.
 They\'re strong when they\'re together.
 ...Owowow.
 ...I wonder if this is going to become a mouth ulcer..."
"Calm down, reload.
 ......Updating ammo type.
 Precision light-speed sniper rounds.
 Prepare for precision sniping."
"Sounds good nyeh! Impossible to intercept super high-speed rounds!
 Impossible to defend against for a mere Gatekeeper nyeh!"
"Precision sniping understood.
 Commencing collection of precision firing data........."
"Wh-what in the world was that just now......?"
"Don\'t worry, I\'m as clueless as you...
 All I know is that we\'d be dead if we hadn\'t relied on those two..."
"Kanon-kun, thanks.
 Go back to the metal bars.
 Next will probably come a shot that you can\'t intercept."
"How do we block against such an attack...?!"
"We don\'t let them shoot.
 ......Kanon-kun, spirit particle combat, guard yourself."
At those words, Kanon closed his eyes tightly and clenched his teeth.
......With Shannon at the center, a pressure and impact blasted out that could only be perceived by those not human.
"......Huh?!
 Firing system error!!
 No good, rebooting...
 Huh, huh?!"
"Spirit wave jamming! Spirit particle protection, move it!
 What are you doing, cover your ears, 45!!!"
An unseen, unheard impact blasted towards the Chiester Sisters.
00 and 410 crouched down, covering their ears...but 45 didn\'t make it in time.
......Still standing bolt upright, her eyes rolled inside her head.
"Ukyu...?!?!"
"...Kyuu? Kyuu!
 Kyuu
kyuu
kyu~!!!"
"45, damaged...!
 Her compiler engine\'s gone kaput...!!
 ......U...gya, ......the noise...is horrible for me too nyeh......"
"45,
 410,
 ......and 00,
 damaged...
 Abandoning sniping.
 ......Ack, it came straight through the link......
 H-have to reboot..."
Raising their spirit particle sensitivity for precision sniping had backfired.
They had taken the full brunt of the spirit particle shock wave Shannon had released,
 and not only 45, who had been hit directly, but also 00 and 410, who had been linked with her, were taken down.
"Are you alright?!
 ......I\'ll make you some more delicious black tea later, okay? Hold together!"
"M-......my apologies, ma\'am......
 We\'ll reboot.
 Please wait a few hundred seconds......"
All of the Chiester Sisters collapsed.
 They would probably get back up eventually, but it looked like it would be hard for them to return to the battle lines for a while.
"So, furniture was able to repel weapons, if for but a moment.
 .........I see, the plots which entertain that child truly are filled with unexpected turns!"
VIRGILIA tore the air with a large motion as though opening a door.
"Come, arise, goat attendants...!
 It\'s time for work.
 Kill and capture the escapees.
 Corpses are fine, we can just revive them anyway!"
A gold-colored door opened in the air, and countless giant goats with muscular bodies peeked their faces out...
"Come now, hurry.
 There are five escapees, so the fastest five of you win!
 There will be a wonderful prize! Come on now, go for it, go for it!"
VIRGILIA clapped her hands, urging them on.
A prize?!
 After glancing at each other at those words, the goats rushed to the door at once, trying to get out,
 making the exit as tight a squeeze as the trains during the commuter rush.
Each wanted to get out first, so none of them could get out.
......VIRGILIA held her head in frustration.
By that time, Kanon had managed to cut just enough bars to make a gap that could be slipped through.
It proved a bit of work for Krauss, large as he was, and Nanjo, whose waist was nearly his downfall, but even so, they all managed to make it through.
But their relief at getting through was short-lived.
Immediately, another set of metal bars blocked the way in front of them.
"The security sure is tough.
 ......I bet they really didn\'t want the people in here to escape."
"Kanon, sorry, but I\'ll have to ask you again.
 ......I\'m sure it\'s tough on you, but please...!"
There was sweat on Kanon\'s forehead.
You could tell at a glance that cutting the metal bars, which had been made even more solid by magic, was exhausting him considerably.
"......Yes, leave it to me, Krauss-sama."
"Only you can do it!
 Please, we\'re counting on you...!"
Only he...could do it.
 ......Holding tightly onto those words,
 Kanon concentrated his mind again and once more set himself to the task of cutting the bars.
".........Enemies are coming from behind. Multiple."
"Yes, this time, even we can tell.
 ......The ground\'s really shaking.
 I can tell that some terrible monsters are rushing at us."
"Don\'t worry.
 I\'ll seal the bars we just came through with a magic lock.
 Goats won\'t be able to break it."
Shannon held her hand out towards the bars they had come through.
......But she stopped right away.
"Wh-what is it...?"
"VIRGILIA-sama has started neutralizing the spirit wave jamming...
 It\'ll be bad if it\'s broken - we\'ll lose the initiative once the Chiester Sisters are rebooted...!"
"I\'ll make you pay in full for bullying these cute rabbits."
"If you\'re trying to gain the advantage with those crafty little spirit particles, I\'ll tear all that off and rob you of them."
"Nee-san, concentrate on the spirit wave jamming!
 The gap in those bars is too narrow for those goats.
 It should hold them back for a while...!"
"I don\'t have a clue what you\'re saying, but - "
"We at least got the point that it\'s something pretty bad."
Kyrie picked up a metal bar that Kanon had just cut.
Krauss had no weapon, but he rubbed his fist, and the two of them glared into the depths of the underground passage where the shaking was coming from.
"......I believe this set of bars is the final thing blocking the way."
"How far is it to the mansion from here?"
"Quite a walk...
 The path is even, but I seem to remember walking for thirty minutes......"
"So if we run flat out, it\'ll be half that time."
They couldn\'t tell for sure since they didn\'t have the three-sided mirror,
 but there was no guarantee that George and Jessica could hold out against demon opponents for all that time.
"......If we run at twice walking speed, it\'ll be fifteen minutes.
 And running at twice that speed again would make it eight minutes."
"And if we sprint flat out at double that speed again, it won\'t even take five.
 No sweat."
"Wh-what an unreasonable calculation...
 But calculations in dire emergencies do tend to be that way...!"
"......My sincere apologies, everyone.
 The rest will be up to you...!"
"Leave it to us.
 Kanon, you cut the bars as fast as you can.
 Shannon, you concentrate on jamming this witch called VIRGILIA or whatever.
 Kyrie-san and I will defend against the pursuers...!"
Then, the roars of beasts rang out from the darkness, and numerous fiery, glowing, bright-red eyes appeared.
The goats rushing towards them, with thunderous force, were several levels more massive than the guards had been.
The tremors they created were almost like an earthquake.
The power and terror was tremendous, but Kyrie instead laughed with relief.
......Those massive bodies wouldn\'t be able to go through the gap in the bars!
The group of goats crashed into the metal bars with a terrific sound like that of a train colliding with a dead end.
Clumps of dirt fell here and there from the ceiling, and you could tell that the metal bars had buckled inwards.
.....The force of their charge must have been no different from a train.
If the metal bars hadn\'t been there, they would undoubtedly have swallowed the five of them up and crushed them in an instant.
When the group of goats, pressed up against the metal bars, realized that the five were right in front of them,
 they let out a terrible howl, trying to intimidate the five.
......Although it was hard to tell whether that was really intimidation, or because of the pain from being pushed and shoved.
One calm goat among them figured out that it just needed to do something about the metal bars,
 and grabbed two of them with its massive arms, and began bending them as though opening double doors.
Kyrie sharply jabbed her metal pole at that goat\'s vitals...!
 The goat let out a roar of anguish.
It probably hurt a lot, but that was all.
It wasn\'t enough to bring it down...
"Krauss-san...!!"
"Rrroooaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!!"
Still holding the stuck-in metal pole, Kyrie relinquished the opposite tip to Krauss.
Krauss ran there with all his might, leapt into the air and kicked it in with all his weight and kicking power combined...!
All of that destructive power was focused on that single pole, drilling it in!!
"......A-are you alright?
 Please don\'t rub the affected area.
 I shall prescribe some medicine later. Take care..."
As the goat who had taken a pile bunker to its vitals writhed with teary eyes,
 it nodded its head.
"Looks like our link isn\'t that bad either.
 We can\'t let Shannon-chan and Kanon-kun beat us."
"Naturally. We are a loving family, after all."
"We can take them if it\'s two-on-one!
 Next, that one on the right!"
"Roger...!
 You seem like a great wife. That Rudolf, I\'m starting to think he grumbled a little too much."
"Oh? You\'ll have to tell me about that later.
 Rudolf-san, it\'s no use you turning white in heaven, it\'s too late for excuses."
The goat\'s massive body sank into the rose bush.
 Even taking into account that a leg\'s power is three times that of an arm\'s, this strength surpassed common sense.
That massive body, flying up and through the air from being kicked in the chin...it was too epic!
Even George seemed a little surprised.
"......To think that my kick works on monsters too.
 I\'m astonished."
"...............It\'s because of your counterattacking-type barrier.
 ......The attack power that grazes you is added on to your own.
 ......The superhuman power of those monsters has been added to your kicks..."
"Hmm......
 ...I don\'t really get it, but isn\'t that just perfect for me?
 ......If you\'re going to attack me, then no matter who you are, you should be prepared for a counterattack of equal measure.
 Nonaggressive defense.
 That\'s exactly my policy."
That\'s why Gaap couldn\'t easily touch him.
The counterattacking-type barrier had no defensive power.
 However, because of its counterattacking characteristic, it could be useful in defense by making the opponent hesitate to attack.
The goats were foolish, so they attacked without worrying,
 but the effect was being realized to the full against Gaap.
"These guys really are dull.
 When your power is even, it\'s better to be of a smaller build."
He lightly dodged the log-like arm.
When that arm touched the barrier that protected George, it let off a strong, red light.
......And the tip of the foot that was counterattacking gained the same shine, and the superhuman power of the goat was added to George\'s own.
The second goat fell forwards and floated in the air for a second.
Then, George\'s next roundhouse kick missed right over the falling goat\'s head.
......For an instant, the goat hoped to get away with its life.
But no!!
 A heel was dropped onto the back of its head, and it was forced to kiss the ground.
"......Going from a high roundhouse kick into a neri chagi is pretty basic, right?
 It connects pretty often if you don\'t overuse it."
"This guy\'s......a problem,
 ...seriously a problem......!!"
"Demons? Witches? Get real.
 .........The rulers of Rokkenjima are this Ushiromiya family.
 I will teach that to you with every ounce of strength in my body."
".........Yoooouuuu.........!!"
The only way to finish off George now that his body was wrapped up in the counterattacking-type barrier...was to not allow him a counterattack.
......Next time she sucked him into the Abyss, she would have to kick and drop him, kick and drop him, kick and drop him,
 until she kicked him to death!!!
But George had already perfected reading the faint warning signs that told of the appearance of Gaap\'s pitfalls.
......If he managed to jump over that next pit,
 ......then this time, he would probably pulverize Gaap\'s head with his whirlwind-like kick, without holding back in the slightest,
 ......just as had been done to his parents.
She was able to envision that scene vividly.
It was far too late now, but Gaap cursed Kinzo all the same for calling her out to this ridiculous island...!
Ronove finally started using both of his hands to form his shield.
Without a more powerful shield, he wouldn\'t be able to completely block Jessica\'s fists anymore.
The enchantment on Jessica\'s fists grew the more she fought.
The permeation upgrade had already stacked several times,
 and those fists had also been given an impact upgrade, a piercing upgrade, and a speed upgrade, making them fists worthy to fight on par with a demon...
".........What\'s wrong?!
 Starting to get tired?!
 You\'re getting all slow!!"
"No.
 Your movements, thoughts, and kinetic vision have been exponentially enchanted.
 .........My movements have not changed from the beginning.
 ......Your movements are beginning to capture me."
"And you still won\'t fight back...?!!"
"This is the style which I insist upon.
 ......However, I cannot allow things to continue as they are.
 It\'s about time for me to get serious and end this......!!"
Ronove\'s face turned into an expression he had never shown before.
It was truly demonic, and to Jessica\'s eyes, full of respect.
Because it was an expression only shown to enemies strong enough to make him get serious.
"Whooaa?!?!
 What the heck?!"
With a whole-body gesture that you couldn\'t call elegant, Ronove set up a shield with all his strength, the size and thickness of a wall.
Its sturdiness was nothing like a shield.
 It was literally a wall.
And on top of that, with all of Ronove\'s magical power, it pushed Jessica back bit by bit.
......Did he plan on pushing her back against the wall and crushing her to death?
Jessica tried to break through the wall with both fists, but it was solid.
 ......Without any exaggeration, it was solid!
"You call this serious...?!!
 No problem... I\'ll break right through iiiiiiiiiiitt!!"
"I will not let you this time.
 This wall is somewhat different.
 ......Here, allow me to enchant it as well."
Ronove made magic signs with his fingers almost like a ninja;
 the wall glowed red for just an instant, and became imbued with some kind of ominous power.
Almost immediately, Jessica also gained a firsthand understanding of this.
Every time she pounded her fists against the wall, pain rebounded upon her as though glass fragments had scattered and hit all over her body.
"I upgraded it with attack-reactive armor.
 An exceptional item which will decrease the force of your attacks by counterbalancing them,
 and can even counterattack with reactive fragments."
"......You are perfectly welcome to keep punching it, but doing so will affect you as well."
"Heh, ...heheh!!
 So it\'s an endurance test between me and your wall?!!
 Fine by me!!"
"Will you fall to your knees first, or be pushed into the wall first?
 ......Allow me to observe."
"Or, I might break through it and smash that whole wall along with your face, ever think about that?!
 Just watch meeeeeeeeeee!!"
Without hesitation, Jessica slammed both fists into the wall.
Each time she did, a large amount of shards scattered, tormenting her body all over.
Countless red cuts soon appeared all over her body...
She grimaced at the intense pain, but her eyes were burning with fighting spirit, and her lips curved in a grin exactly the opposite of the pain...!
"Kanon, are you done yet?!
 We are alright,
 ......but I can\'t say the same for the bars holding those guys in check...!"
"Just......a little more......!"
"There\'s no end to these guys...
 The bars might break just from them shoving each other!"
The metal bars creaked under the strain of the group of goats.
Several arms grabbed the bars, twisting them with superhuman strength.
......However, some bars were being pulled in opposite directions by different hands.
 Apparently they really were stupid.
The way those countless hands were grabbing the metal bars......happened to match up by chance.
Several hands grasping two metal bars neatly put their power together and pulled the bars to the left and right, creating an opening.
The incredible sound of metal bending could be heard, and that gap was getting larger bit by bit...!
They attacked the arms of those goats one by one, but they weren\'t getting anywhere.
They couldn\'t stop the gap from expanding left and right...!
A loud metallic sound came from behind them.
Kanon had finally finished cutting.
"Quickly!!"
"Kyrie-san, ladies first.
 You next, Doctor Nanjo!"
"Krauss-sama, please leave this place to me...!
 Ngh, ......what?!"
Kanon\'s red sword, with which he had cut the metal bars, disappeared.
"......Sorry!
 We\'ve entered VIRGILIA-sama\'s spirit particle combat area of influence!!
 Our magic power is being neutralized!"
"Hoh-hoh-ho.
 I am impressed that you put up such a fight against a Great Witch like me...
 You can no longer use your magic in that underground passage."
A magic circle column drew complex magical formulae around VIRGILIA.
......With such full-fledged magic being used, Shannon\'s power couldn\'t even compete.
On the contrary, it was surprising that she had withstood as much as she had.
"Spirit particle superiority ensured.
 Come, Chiester Sisters. Now it\'s your turn."
"Wait, are you still rebooting?!
 Why are kids so bad at waking up these days...?!"
"M-my apologies, ma\'am...!!
 We\'re all different versions..."
"Why is it that the shortcuts and pulldown menus get all screwed up every time you change versions nyeh...!
 Did not shut down successfully last time?
 Administrator privileges??
 What is all this nonsense!!"
"Ukyu~~!!
 Ukyu~~!!
 (Fix me quickly~!! Waaaah!)"
"Calling Imperial Guards troubleshooting!
 What?
 You won\'t tell us without a user code?!"
"45 is in control of the user code nyeh."
"Ukyuu!!
 U,
 kyu,
 kyu,
 kyo,
 ukyu,
 kyuu!!!"
"A-all I can hear is 9999......
 Have her write it on some paper."
"Her language support system hasn\'t come back up, so she can\'t even write nyeh."
"...........................
 Y-you take your time fixing yourselves...
 I\'ll go myself..."
""Sorryyyyyyyyy~!!""
The narrow underground passage was packed with goats, truly like a commuter train in the morning.
VIRGILIA was again in disbelief at this congestion.
"What are you doing...?!!"
"Huh?
 You want to be first because you want the prize?
 You\'re getting in each other\'s way because you don\'t want the others to steal the prize from you?"
"You stupid goooooooooooooaaaaaaats!!!
 I\'m going myself, so open the way!!"
"What?!
 You don\'t want to?!
 VIRGILIA-sama is trying to steal the prize?!"
"Why are you forming a scrum?!!"
"Aaah, it\'s so crammed and tight!!
 When did this become a goats-only car?!
 Ugyu~~!!
 Whoever just touched my butt, get off at the next statioo~~n!!!"
".........Hm? What do you want?
 Come this way, you say??"
The five people in Krauss\'s group dashed through the passageway with all their strength!
They couldn\'t afford to dawdle around underground.
They had to quickly join up with the children on the surface!
Once everyone was together, there would no longer be anything to fear!
Just then, a terrible rumble started closing in from behind.
Had the pursuers finally made it through the metal bars?!
But they couldn\'t see anyone when they turned around.
But that rumble and the dirt falling here and there from the ceiling grew closer and closer,
 finally catching up with them and even going past them.
It felt almost like they had been passed by ghosts.
The instant after they thought that nothing had happened, the ceiling in front of them fell in, and a single goat stood in their path.
......VIRGILIA was sitting on its shoulder.
"This wise child knew a shortcut.
 What a good kid, you get first prize.
 Later, I\'ll treat you to some homemade mackerel curry."
Maybe it really was happy even to receive such a dubious prize.
 The massive goat showed its joy by putting its hands together and wiggling.
VIRGILIA leapt down, laughing that now it was finally checkmate.
"......Damn...... It\'s no good...
 ......Our magic has been completely killed..."
"...It\'s too early to give up...
 ......Even without magic, we still have our bodies..."
"D-don\'t be ridiculous...!
 There\'s no way you could fight a monster like that without that strange power...!"
"......S-stay back, children..."
"I\'ll handle them somehow, so you escape past that monster while I\'m keeping him busy...!"
"I won\'t let you.
 Hohhohohohohoho!"
VIRGILIA clapped her hands, and a purple magic barrier appeared behind her,
 stealing even the faint hope that Krauss had been betting on.
"Is there...nothing more to be done......?
 ...N-no, there\'s still a chance.
 ......Even Jessica fought.
 I must do the same..."
"A-are you serious?!
 It\'s not possible, not against that massive monster...!"
"Don\'t be absurd...!
 Krauss-san, let us think of another way......"
"If you think of something, I\'m open to suggestions.
 Until then, it looks like I\'ll have to manage something...
 ......Come on, get back."
"......Be careful."
"Hohohoho...hohhohohohohohohoho!
 My, my, Krauss.
 You intend to fight this child alone?"
"........................khh...
 Y-you never know.
 In a fight, it\'s always possible to get in a lucky shot..."
"Hohhohohoho.
 You think you can win even with a fluke...?
 Allow me to explain the situation for you, since you clearly don\'t know your place."
"Whaat......?"
"Hohohoho...
 Assuming you were to wield 100% of your strength, your power level is at most 6.
 In comparison, this child has a power level of 1000.
 In short, even if there were 100 of you, you could never win."
"Well, it\'s true that there are uncertain elements in a fight.
 I will admit that your power level has a slight scaling factor to it."
"But even so, your chances of defeating him are around perhaps 0.00001%.
 Do you understand?
 You don\'t even have a one in ten thousand chance of victory.
 Hoh-hoh-hoh-ho...!"
VIRGILIA and the goat guffawed together.
"D-...damn it......
 If it\'s a one in ten thousand chance, then the payoff will be ten thousand times more, will it not?
 ......A good dark horse.
 I like betting tickets like that, makes me want to buy them..."
"Hoh-hoh-hoh-ho!
 But the coin to buy that is your life, and there\'s only one of those, you know.
 Nevertheless, I can understand the feeling of wanting to entrust your fate to that miracle."
"......Which is why, in praise of your courage for standing against us without fear, I shall give you a bit of a handicap.
 This child will fight with only his left arm.
 Well, even so, I can\'t imagine for a moment that he\'ll lose to you."
"............Seriously, what is that thing that keeps going bing-bong-bing-bong?"
"V-......very well.
 I\'ll accept that challenge......
 Left arm or whatever else, I\'m sure I\'d be killed with a single strike in any case.
 ......I also only have a single chance at a strike.
 I can only bet everything on that."
"That\'s absurd, Krauss-san...!
 I, I know that you used to do boxing, but I believe that was from your college days...
 No, no, even if there were a pro boxer here, there\'s no way he could defeat a monster like that with just one strike...!"
"......That would be true if it were a match in the ring.
 But Krauss nii-san does have an admittedly small chance that he can set his hopes on.
 ......He\'s setting all his hopes on that one chance..."
"Y-you aren\'t saying......
 But...there\'s no way that\'s going to work..."
"......Krauss-sama........."
"W-watch me...
 I\'ll settle this with a single strike......"
Hoh-hoh-hoh-ho...
 How unwise.
I know what you\'re gunning for.
The distance between the two of them is more than 10 meters.
If the goat and Krauss both step in with all their strength to settle the fight with a single blow, their power will be double the norm.
Both will crash together, so it will be a relative 4 times normal.
Even if, on top of that, the strike miraculously lands on a weak point for a critical hit, that will only double the power.
.........In short, Krauss\'s maximum power level of 6, times 8, will cap out at 48 at the most.
He might just barely be able to win if he repeated that lucky shot a full 20 times.
Hohhohohohoho, if you\'re killed every time you take a hit, and your damage still accumulates,
 .......let\'s see, perhaps you could finally win when we get to Episode 24?
Hoh-hoh-hoh-ho, if only this series could stretch on so long...!!
 Either way, you don\'t even have the slightest chance of victory!
......Good gracious, what is that bing-bong I keep hearing?
"I will be betting everything on a single strike...
 You have no reason to hold back either.
 Give it everything you\'ve got..."
"Hohohoho, he\'s requesting that you go all out.
 Pulverize him with a single all-out strike, and turn him into chunks of meat."
As the goat got excited and beat its chest over and over, it took a position as though preparing for a sprint.
Hoh-hoh-hoh-ho, is this what you were hoping for?
Stake your hopes on your greatest power level, and despair when even that doesn\'t reach at all!
It pinged again!
 That thing is really getting on my nerves, what is it?!
"Here I come......
 Ready?"
The goat roared in response.
Then, with a matched timing that only the men confronting each other could comprehend,
 ......the two leapt forward like bullets shot out of a gun.
The men howled, collecting the strength from all over their bodies into one arm each.
The goat\'s fiery glowing eyes clearly locked onto Krauss\'s face.
......He could perfectly see a vision of when he would step forwards,
 when he would punch through Krauss and blow him away,
 and when he would achieve his total victory.
The long, painful days before today drifted through the goat\'s mind......
The hard days of training where his senpais had picked on him...
The faint glimpses of his senpais\' warm concern during those days.
And the joy of that day his power had been acknowledged, and he had been accepted as one of the team...!
I never properly respected my parents.
......That\'s right, I\'d actually planned on washing my hands of this business when this job was over, and returning to my hometown.
Sorry, my little goat sister...your onii-chan caused you nothing but trouble.
And I, ...a-actually have a childhood friend, and I\'m going to marry her when I get hoooooome!!!
"Gyaaaaaaaaahh!!!
 Nooooooooooo!!
 Don\'t trip so many loser flaaaaaa-aaaaags!!"
"You can\'t handle that punch, dodge iiiiiiiiiit!!"
It happened the instant before the two crashed and their punches crossed.
"Foolish, VIRGILIA.
 It looks like you couldn\'t make a composed decision."
"You must not take that punch!!
 Deflect it!!"
"?!?!"
The very instant the goat\'s left straight and Krauss\'s right straight crossed!
 The goat obeyed VIRGILIA\'s order with super-fast reflexes and pulled back his straight, deflecting Krauss\'s punch!
".........mmgh - "
Yes, VIRGILIA\'s decision was probably wise.
After all, the number of loser flags act as a multiplier on the opponent\'s power level!
"That was close.
 If you had taken that punch after tripping so many loser flags, imagine just how great a force it would have been multiplied to...!!"
"Come on, from there, smash the completely open right side of his face with a right straight!!"
"What?
 The promise about fighting with only your left arm?"
"Hoh-hoh-ho!!
 Promises are made to be brokennnnn!!"
"Gyaah, tripped another ooooooone!!"
"I\'m disappointed, VIRGILIA.
 You really were lacking composure."
"What\'s that......?!
 How was I not composed by noticing it beforehand and making him avoid it...?!"
"Wh-...why is that, Kyrie-sama...?
 If they had crashed like that, wouldn\'t Krauss-sama have won......?"
".........Ah, I, I see...!
 Even with 20 loser flags,
 ......that\'s still not enough!"
Krauss\'s and the goat\'s double rush make it x4.
With a miracle on their side, the firm promise of a critical hit would double it again for x8.
On top of that, a multiplier of x20 equal to the number of tripped loser flags applies, making it x160.
At a glance, that looks like an incredible amplification, but even so, Krauss\'s power level is 6.
Even multiplied by 160, it only makes for a power level of 960.
Just a fraction below the goat\'s 1000...!
"That\'s why I said you weren\'t composed.
 You made a blunder.
 If they had crashed like that, you would have won."
"H-hoh-hoh-hoh-ho!!
 Even if that were so, it all comes to the same thing if this right straight smashes Krauss\'s head!!
 Die, Ushiromiya Krauss!!!"
"......Take this...the most powerful blow in the world of boxing."
Having deflected Krauss\'s right straight,
 the goat\'s own right straight closed in on the right side of Krauss\'s face, which had been left open...
But there, it crossed with a left straight from Krauss...
The two punches crossed, and time stopped as each aimed for the face of the other......
"Ho.........hohohoho.
 To think that it would be brought to a simultaneous strike at a moment like this!
 But his power level caps out at x160, making it 960!!
 You never made it to my child\'s 1000...!"
".........No.
 VIRGILIA-san.
 ......You\'ve lost."
"Why?!"
"You made your goat deflect the first cross-counter.
 ......Certainly, if the right straight he issued after that were to hit, Krauss-san would probably be in pieces."
"...However, that was crossed...
 ......That\'s just no good.
 I\'m afraid this is a complete loss for your goat."
A cross-counter has four times the destructive power.
This is common knowledge in boxing.
And if that is deflected, and the right straight hits, then the double cross-counter has 8 times the destructive power.
This is also common knowledge in boxing.
If that is crossed......
By the principle of leverage, the triple cross then multiplies the destructive power by 12!
This is also painfully common knowledge in the world of boxing!!
".........Krauss-san\'s power level is 6."
"A double multiplier from both sides for rushing in, making it times 4."
"Th-the critical hit makes it times 8."
"Up to times 160 for tripping too many loser flags."
"......And times 12 on top of that for the triple cross-counter."
"T-......times 1920......"
A power level of...11520...!!
 Krauss\'s punch now had the power to easily win that Budokai tournament...!!!
"......This result was brought about by Krauss-san\'s persistence in not giving up on victory until the end, ......and your conceit.
 Without either, it would never have become so powerful..."
"......You fought well.
 .........It\'s okay, you can fall now..."
Nanjo patted the goat on the shoulder...
......O-......onii-chan...gave it his all......
As the sparkling drops from the goat\'s eyes scattered, he softly toppled backwards,
 and flattened VIRGILIA like a pancake.
"Ugyaa!!
 Heavyyyyyyy, get oooffffff!"
The goat\'s massive body was too heavy for the slender VIRGILIA.
She floundered around with it on top of her, but it didn\'t look like she would be able to escape.
In that instant, the barrier VIRGILIA had sealed broke.
"No hard feelings, please.
 Underestimating the principle of leverage was the cause of your defeat."
"......I wonder why the principle of leverage worked on that counter.
 It\'s an eternal mystery."
"Let\'s escape while we can...!!
 You take care, Mr. Goat...!"
"W-well then, excuse us, VIRGILIA-sama!"
".........*bow*."
"Waaaaaaaaiiit!!
 Get back heeeere!!
 Get this thing off meeeeee!!
 Kiiii!! Gapgapgapgap!!!"
There was nothing more to block their way.
......They ran through the underground passage with single-minded purpose...!
Jessica had finally been cornered with the wall at her back.
......Ronove\'s magic barrier was advancing bit by bit, and would probably crush her against the wall before long.
Considering the distance...this would be the final strike, the final throw of her iron fist.
Jessica had dealt out many punches so far.
......The wall wasn\'t invincible.
 It had already started to crack, and it wouldn\'t be strange for it to smash at any moment.
However, due to the rebounding damage,
 Jessica herself was in very bad shape, with cuts all over her body.
"......Just stop this now.
 I don\'t intend to crush you.
 It is up to the Master to decide how to deal with you.
 ......However, I do intend to put in a good word for your impressive fight."
"N-
.........no...frigging...
...way...
 ......Not yet......
 It\'s not......over yet........."
"......You have wounds all over your body.
 It\'s all you can manage just to stand, is it not?
 ......It seems that you plan on putting all of your strength into this final strike.
 However, that final strike will instead prove fatal for you."
The damage reflected by Ronove\'s magic barrier was proportional to the strength of the attack.
Jessica\'s all-out punch would be bounced back onto her.
......The more all-out she went, the more suicidal it would be for her.
"I, I get it......
 I know that........."
"I am warning you.
 Stop this now.
 It is for your own good."
"Stop bluffing.
 Your wall is about to break, right...?
 I\'ve been the one punching it, you think I can\'t feel that.........?"
"........................"
That was...a fact.
 Ronove\'s wall was already on the verge of breaking.
And on top of that,
 Jessica\'s fists had been imbued with an unimaginable magical attack power by now, and their destructive power defied the imagination.
......If she wasn\'t careful, that destructive power might pierce the defensive wall, smash Ronove as well,
 and then go on to expand the size of her bedroom by connecting it to the room next door.
......However, that damage would rebound on Jessica as well.
She wouldn\'t escape unharmed!
"I will say it just one more time.
 Stop.
 I say this out of consideration for you!"
"Shut the hell up......
 .........Say your prayers."
Jessica howled.
 ......Putting all her strength and her last and greatest destructive power into her fist, she roared......
The three goats had been beaten down long ago.
 Without a single ragged breath, George cautiously closed the distance between him and Gaap.
......He was after her.
 He was planning on bringing her down with a single strike...
Gaap was also aiming for a single strike.
.........If she let that chance slide, this time, she would be killed......
"......Aren\'t you going to use your pitfalls?"
"............Ack......"
Even the tiny moment of weakness during the time it took to open the hole would prove fatal against George now.
......Gaap cautiously calculated the distance and timing, but even as she did, George closed the gap between them...
".........If you won\'t move forward, then I will."
"......C-......come on then...
 No more tricks.
 ......This kick of mine...
...will end this!"
The instant she noticed George\'s body blur, ......only his jacket was floating in the air.
A short sound of realization entered her mind, and in that instant, darkness covered her.
George, with his heel swung up high, looked even like a massive dragon attacking from the sky.
"Y-you fell for it......
 ......I win, Ushiromiya George!!"
"What - "
Gaap opened a vast pit with her in the center, and swallowed up George along with herself...!!
The two were swallowed up by the pit, and spat out from the ceiling of the arbor.
But that was what Gaap had been after, so she alone landed lightly.
 ......But there was another pit in George\'s landing spot.
"Ehheheheheheheh, aaaahhahahahahahahahahaha!!!
 Got you, Ushiromiya Geoooooooooorge!!"
"It\'s been fun die now,
 it would be a waste for someone as good as you to end up as the Ushiromiya family head,
 so I\'ll eat you up right here, right now!!!
 Oooooorrrrroooooooooaaaaahhh!!"
George once again fell from the ceiling of the arbor.
 He had probably been dropped the same distance as falling off the roof of a two-story building.
In midair, he couldn\'t control his posture in any way.
It was impossible to resist or defend or avoid!!
As Gaap spun like a whirlwind, she concentrated all of her energy on the sharp tip of her stiletto heel.
......This was the final strike...to perform his requiem.
The queen bee\'s final strike, that would bore into heaven, knocking him down into the true Abyss!!
"Welcome to the Abyss!!
 This is the end of the line for you!!!"
Her prey captured in her sight, she launched her foot up into the sky.
......It was then that she saw George\'s face.
 .........Even though he was in midair, he was calmly adjusting his glasses with the middle finger of his left hand.
And his posture was still preserved as that of an axe kick.
Aiming for Gaap\'s forehead, without the faintest deviation......
".........I already anticipated that you would opt for that move."
"............Wh...at.........?"
"If I\'d jumped to make the person that was on the ground taste my heel, my posture would have collapsed long ago.
 .........However, my posture hasn\'t collapsed in the slightest.
 Do you know why?"
"......You...
...don\'t...
mean......"
"From the very beginning,
 ......I jumped to make the person that was two stories below taste my heel!!!"
"Uungh, ......oooooooooooooohhhaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh!!!"
"You lose, missy!!!"
"Bing-bong."
"Unnggggrrrroooooaaaaaaahhh, take thiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiss!!!"
Jessica\'s last and strongest upwards punch...
reached the wall,
 ......and was sucked in.
It was sucked into the black, large hole that had suddenly opened on the wall.
"Well, .........I did advise you to stop."
"What.........the............"
"......Ghhg............ah......"
"Truth is,
 .........I was never in even the slightest little bit of trouble.
 Soorry..."
......Jessica\'s fist had gone for George\'s stomach,
 ......and George\'s axe kick had lined up on Jessica\'s head.
The shocking destructive power imbued in Jessica\'s fist crushed George\'s organs and scattered his abdomen.
The equally-as-shocking destructive power in George\'s axe kick smashed half of Jessica\'s head, and scattered its contents in the same manner......
"Pfft, ...ahhahahahahahahahahahaha...!!
 I mean, come onnnn.
 Witches are all about the acting, riiiiight?
 Hey, Riiche, how was it, were you watching...?"
"Wahahaha, waaaahhyahhyahhya, aaakkyakkyakkya!!
 Not baaad, followed the script to a T!
 You really do get it, Gaap!!
 Woohoo!!"
Beato and Gaap gave each other a light high five.
"......hhh...
...aaahh...
............hhhhhhuuAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!!!"
"Thanks, Ronove.
 That was a treat.
 I\'ll return Jessica\'s corpse back there.
 ......Separate the corpses of the two who are close.
 ......Is the second twilight done now?"
Gaap dropped Jessica\'s corpse into a pit,
 and chucked all the chunks of meat, too, into Jessica\'s room,
 as carelessly as throwing them into the trash...
Jessica\'s corpse and lumps of flesh fell from the ceiling and poured out all over her room.
Ronove shook his head slightly at this all-too-gruesome change.
"............My apologies, Jessica-sama.
 I did warn you."
"Of course,
 ...I suppose it\'s only natural that a Human like yourself can\'t understand the demonic pleasure I derive from foreseeing this conclusion and giving you repeated warnings that I know you won\'t listen to.
 ......Pukkukukukukukukukukuku!"
"It really was fun, kiddo.
 ......But you play with words a little too much.
 ......I think \'If you\'re ready, may I fight back\' was the absolute classic?
 Eheheh, you\'ve been reading a few too many light novels or something, you know?
 *giggle*giggle*giggle*!"
In the arbor brutally decorated by George and Jessica\'s scattered blood and guts,
 Gaap enjoyed a loud laugh for a while...
...But she quickly realized that, in all seriousness, this was a little too filthy and undignified, and she snapped her fingers.
As she did, gold butterflies rose up from the ground all around the garden,
 stuck to each of the bits and stained patches of blood, and got them out.
......Then, bit by bit, they slowly turned back into George\'s corpse,
 and the awful corpse with its guts splattered out was repaired into a clean corpse that looked like it was sleeping.
Was this some kind of post-mortem sportsmanship towards a good opponent............?
The heavens were slowly split.
......Because Gaap had lifted a leg high into the air, pointing at the sky.
"So long, lady killer.
 This is the real Game Over."
Squish.
 ......Without a trace of mercy, that foot was brought down,
 ......and buried into George\'s forehead.
Her stiletto heel, sharp as a weapon, was impaled through George\'s forehead.
She......pulled it out with a blorp......
It was like a mark of proof that Gaap had indeed finished him by her own hand......
Ronove returned Jessica\'s corpse to its original form as well.
......And unlike how it had been with George, he also restored Jessica\'s life......
"...U-...nff, .........*cough*, *cough*......
......what in the.........world......
 ......A dream......?"
"No, that is wrong.
 ......You certainly did pass away, Jessica-sama.
 You should be well aware of the memory of your final moments."
It was burnt into the back of Jessica\'s mind.
......For some reason, she remembered being thrown somewhere, ......and that her head had been smashed by George\'s heel......
"Am I......alive......?"
"No, you are dead.
 That is merely being postponed for a scant three minutes with my magic.
 After three minutes, the magic will end, and you will return to being a tragic corpse with half of its head destroyed."
"Wha......t.........?
 ......Heh, .........heheheheh......"
"Death is brutal.
 In most cases, you aren\'t even given the time to ready your heart.
 ......However, I have decided to give you that time, in recognition of your valiant battle.
 Use those three minutes to ensure that your lingering attachments to this world are all taken care of."
"Or, ......I could use those three minutes to take you down with me......"
But the power that had been burning inside Jessica\'s body was now completely lost.
......Jessica was aware of that herself.
 She was already dead.
"Well then, I will leave you now.
 If you would excuse me.
 ......It was fun, Jessica-sama."
Ronove turned his form into a cloud of gold butterflies, and disappeared.
All that remained was the sound of the wind and rain, and the figure of Jessica, crouching down against the wall......
Jessica realized.
 After three minutes, she probably really would revert to the corpse she had been.
......In those three minutes, was there anything she could do.........?
She stood up, and with a shaky gait,
 ......took the phone that was on the desk...
"He-......hello.
 ......Is that you, Jessica?
 Jessica?!
 What is it, are you alright?!?!"
".........Heh, ......heheheheh...
 ......They...got me......"
"Are you alright?!
 Are you hurt?!
 I\'ll come help you right now!!"
"Nah, ......it\'s too late.
 ...I\'m...already dead, apparently...
 Ahahaha, by the time you get here, I\'ll be a corpse with half my head spilled out."
"Goddamn that old man!!
 Wait right there, I\'m coming right now!!"
"Listen, Battler!!!
 Listen closely, alright...?
 .........I know exactly why Gohda-san and Kumasawa-san were so awkward talking about the guys who killed the six in the dining hall."
".........Those guys, uh...
......they aren\'t...
Human."
"Wh-...whaat?!
 What are you talking about........."
"What do you want me to say, man, I frigging saw it, okay?!!
 Those guys, they warp, set up barriers, ahhaha, all of that crap, y\'know...?
 It\'s like some manga, some anime, ......seriously, we can\'t deal with that."
"......Ahhahhahhah......
 ...It was never gonna happen, fighting them... It\'s impossible......
 That hat-stand spear you were so proud of, you\'d need something way better than that to deal with these guys..."
A line of blood dripped down from Jessica\'s forehead......
"George nii-san didn\'t make it either.
 Instant death, that was...
 .........Heheh, the next test is yours, Battler.
 .........I wonder if your test will be the same as ours......
 .........Be careful, ......and don\'t get it wrong."
"Y-you mean the test...?"
"No.
 .........Don\'t get it wrong and...
...think the enemy\'s obviously gotta be Human."
".........The enemy...is not Human.
 ...They\'re demons......who can wield terrifying magic at will."
"No matter what, ......don\'t get that wrong......"
"*cough*, *cough*cough*!! Watch......yourself......"
A line of blood dripped down from Jessica\'s mouth as well.
......The left half of her head started hurting.
Jessica realized that she was about to return to the corpse she had been.
"...............When thirteen people die, the Golden Witch...revives.
 Mom and the others killed earlier were the first six.
 That\'s the first twilight.
 ......And with George nii-san and me dead, that\'s the second.
 ......So if just five more people are killed, the ritual is gonna be complete, ......and the witch will revive."
".........I hope Dad and the rest are safe...
 ......If they aren\'t,
 .........the one to test you...
might be the newly resurrected BEATRICE herself..."
By now, Battler had no idea what Jessica was saying.
But from her tone, he realized that she knew she was about to die.
So even though he didn\'t understand the situation, he urged her to hang on in there.
"......Haha, I told you, I\'m already dead.
 .........See ya.
 It looks like time\'s up.
 ......Good luck on your test.
 I hope you can...become the head.
 ..........................."
"Jessica?
 Jessica?!
 Hey, answer me!!
 Jessicaaaaaaaaaaa!!"
Battler\'s sorrowful voice could be heard from the dangling receiver.
......Crouching with her back against the adjacent wall...
......Jessica\'s head was half smashed.........
"Where are we......?"
"...Is this...a well......?
 Where is this...?"
Kyrie stuck her face out of the well, and then Krauss showed himself too.
When he noticed that they could see the back of the mansion beyond a grove of trees, Krauss realized more or less where they were.
......To think that there had been a hidden underground passage in a well all the way out here,
 and that it led to a hidden mansion......
"Th-this really is tough on this old body......
 ......Ordinarily, you can come up through a different place, with real stairs.
 Provided you can unlock it..."
"......I have many questions I\'d like to ask you about the layout of this place later, Doctor Nanjo.
 ......Shannon, are you alright? Grab my hand."
"I, ......I\'m okay.
 Kanon-kun, quickly."
Kanon was the last, climbing up the ladder towards them in the shaft disguised as a well.
......It was probably quite deep.
When he looked down, for the first time, he realized how far he\'d come up.
"Nihi. Firing."
Bang.
............As Kanon was about to finally crawl out of the well, a hole the size of a basketball opened up in his chest.
......Everyone there looked through the hole in Kanon\'s chest to the scenery beyond......
"K-..........Kanon-kun!!!"
"......Ne...
...e-sa...
............"
Kanon toppled backwards,
 ......and was swallowed up into the depths of the well......
"E-everyone, run for it!!
 The Chiester Sisters!!
 They\'ve locked on, we can\'t avoid them!!
 Run!!
 At least one of us survive...!!!"
At that time, Krauss, Kyrie, and Nanjo...
clearly saw a golden curve appear from the well,
 ......and sew itself through the side of Shannon\'s head.........
"Shannon!!!"
Head pierced.
 The three were perfect witnesses to everything, up to and including the opposite side of her head being blasted away into pulp.
Shannon fell to her knees,
 .........blood gushing from both sides of her head,
 and flopped to the ground.
"W-waaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhyaaaaaaaaaahhh!!"
"They\'re after us!!
 Run!!
 We\'ll be killed!!"
"...R-run...run run run!!!"
Nanjo had become paralyzed in fright by the manner of Shannon\'s death, and the Chiester Sisters would not miss their chance.
A curve again appeared from the well, and pierced through Nanjo\'s forehead and out the back of his head in an instant, sewing through him.
......Thump.
 And so Nanjo expired.
"What on Earth... Why...?!!
 Where\'s the enemy attacking from?!"
"We\'re being sniped!!
 I don\'t know where from, but they have us completely in their sights!!
 Escape into the mansion, block their line of sight!!"
The two dashed into the back entrance of the mansion.
Then, the instant Krauss tried to shut the door behind him...
......a golden curve appeared for the fourth time, piercing Krauss from the back of his head out through his forehead, and smashing even his forehead to pieces...
"............nngg...
.........oohh............"
"Eeek!!
 Hiyiiiiiiii!!!"
Krauss\'s body lurched over, fell down hard, and drew a neat radial pattern with the insides of his head...
Kyrie ran wildly through the hallway, flew into some room, and locked the door.
.........But she couldn\'t imagine for a moment that this would save her life.
She would probably die soon!
This was apparently one of the guest rooms.
......At that moment, a phone on a side table caught Kyrie\'s eye...
After hanging up the call from Jessica, Battler was literally just about to dash out.
In that instant, the phone rang again.
"H-hello!!!
 ...............Huh?
 Kyrie-san?!"
"......Yes, Battler-kun.
 ......I got lucky.
 I managed to escape the dungeon somehow.
 I really was fortunate."
"Where are you?!
 Is everyone alright?!
 On our side, it looks like Jessica and George-aniki are - "
"Listen!!!
 I probably won\'t be alive for long."
Then, right after she got the sudden feeling that the keyhole of the locked door might have glowed gold,
 a gold, curved line drawing a helix...
...no, a golden sewing thread...infiltrated the room through there at an incredible speed, and bored a hole into the floor by Kyrie\'s feet.
......Oh, that\'s rare.
The enemy, who had sniped the other four one after another with extraordinary skill,
 apparently really does have trouble shooting me between the eyes with a single shot while I\'m holed up in this room.
But the next strike will probably hit......
At this point, Kyrie finally remembered the initial massacre in the dining hall......
......That\'s right......
 ......This is what killed Rudolf and the rest, all six of them......
"......Listen, Battler-kun.
 I\'m going to tell you everything exactly as I saw it.
 ...I\'m sure you\'ll think that something\'s gone wrong with my head."
"......In fact, it\'s alright for you to think that.
 Even I still haven\'t come to terms with what it was I saw."
".........Today,
 after you all returned to the guesthouse, the family conference began in the dining hall,
 ......and I\'ll tell you everything that happened next."
"Listen until the end without butting in.
 ............The call might suddenly be cut off partway through.
 If it is, that\'s the moment I was killed."
".........Kyrie......san......"
Then, Kyrie spoke...
......about how Kinzo had come, the family conference had started,
 ......the six had been killed, and the five of them had been confined.
......About how she had escaped somehow, and made it to where she was now,
 and how everyone had finally been killed - all spoken dispassionately, as she had seen it, with no dramatization.
......She even spoke about how everyone except her had been killed, and how she had observed the moments of all their deaths,
 ......and how, even this very moment, someone was trying to kill her.
"............Actually,
 even while we\'ve been talking, ...I\'ve been attacked three times.
 Something like a strange gold thread keeps flying in through the keyhole, spinning around and aiming for me."
"First it was by my feet.
 ......Next, it was close to my shoulders.
 ......Just now, it grazed my ear.
 ......Its aim is getting more and more accurate.
 Looks like it\'ll go right between my eyes pretty soon......"
"R-run, Kyrie-san...!!
 Run awaaaaaaaaaaay!!!"
"Where to?
 ......You realize,
 ...I\'ve managed to run all the way here,
 ......shut myself into a room, and even locked the door......?
 .........And I\'m still being targeted.
 .........Just where am I meant to hide...?
 ......Seriously......"
"Ky......
ri...
e...
...san........."
"Battler-kun...
 Are Jessica-chan and George-kun......still alive?"
".....................
 ......Just now, ...there was a phone call from Jessica...
 .........It kinda......sounded like they were...done for......"
".........Thought so.
 ......Yeah, when we five were being killed one after another, I had a kind of premonition.
 ......I thought that perhaps the second twilight had been finished in the thirteen-person murder ritual, and that our twilights had been reached."
".........In other words, when I die, that\'s thirteen.
 Then the ritual will be complete.
 ......The Golden Witch, BEATRICE, will be resurrected."
".........I wonder what will happen.
 ......On this island filled with demons and witches, and swarming with goat monsters,
 ......when even the boss of them all, the Golden Witch, appears,
 .........I wonder just what in the world will happen...
 ......At this point,
 I can\'t...
......make any sense of anything anymore."
Kyrie-san\'s voice......had given up, completely, on her own life.
And because Battler could tell that,
 ......he couldn\'t stop the tears......
"......I did have just one thing...I can advise you on."
"What...?"
".........Even if...
a demon or a witch does appear in front of you..."
"Yeah..."
"There\'s no need whatsoever to doubt what they are.
 ......Understand that they are what they seem."
"........................"
"You might think that there should be some trick, or that there\'s some true identity behind it.
 ......If you have the time to think of something like that,
 ......it would be much more constructive to think of how not to damage the mood of whatever you\'re facing."
"......Even mistakenly, ...you must not say "Prove it then, show me some magic"...
 ......They will probably use a method of utmost cruelty...
...to show you the proof."
"......I can\'t...
...believe it......
 ......I never thought...
...I\'d hear something like that coming from your mouth...
 ......I can\'t believe it........."
"I understand.
 That it\'s unbelievable.
 ......That\'s why...that\'s the only advice I can give to you.
 ......Believe."
".........You\'re telling me to believe in BEATRICE...and demons and witches and monsters......?"
"Probably,
 ......even after being so clearly shown all those things not of this world,
 ......we still weren\'t able to believe any of it, I think."
"......I\'m like that even now.
 ......The true form of this thing that keeps attacking me, trying to shoot through my forehead,
 ......is something I can\'t understand,
 .........and I can\'t believe."
"So,
 ......I want you at least to believe, to understand,
 .........and to accept that being which...
...we couldn\'t fully accept.
 If you do that for me, our deaths won\'t have been in vain.
 .........It\'ll also have been worth it for me to make this phone call...
 ......Ah...!"
"K-Kyrie-san?!?!"
"......I\'m still okay.
 It grazed me, but it missed again.
 ......I very much doubt...
.........that I\'ll survive the next one.
 .........Thank you.
 And goodbye, Battler-kun.
 ......I was once cold towards you because you were Asumu-san\'s son.
 ......Forgive me...for those days."
"What do you mean, forgive you? Kyrie-san, you are a mother to me now!!"
I felt as though I heard an incredible sound at the other end of the receiver.
And then, a noisy clattering sound.
......As though the receiver had fallen to the floor.
"Kyrie-san?!?!
 Kyrie-san!!!
 Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhh!!"
.........Kyrie-san never...
......responded through the phone...
.........again.........
