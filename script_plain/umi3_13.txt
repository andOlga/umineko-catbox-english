"..............................zzzzz..."
"..................Whew.
 ...Looks like she\'s finally calmed down..."
Hideyoshi wiped his own forehead.
 ...For a time, Eva had seemed to be having a very painful nightmare, but it appeared that she had finally fallen asleep.
As promised, he still gripped Eva\'s hand.
 ...He thought it would probably be alright to let go about now, but he faithfully continued to hold her hand.
Every once in a while, his hand would get tired, and he would switch between his right and his left,
 but even so, as promised, he never let go of her hand...
At that time, there was a heavy knock.
 Eva had finally managed to fall asleep, so Hideyoshi grimaced for just an instant.
"......Aneki, Hideyoshi‐san, sorry.
 Is Rosa there...?"
It was Rudolf\'s voice.
 ...What could it be?
Hideyoshi headed for the door, hiding his footsteps so that he wouldn\'t wake Eva.
......It was definitely Rudolf\'s voice, but just in case, he opened the door without removing the chain.
"What is it?
 Somethin\' happen to Rosa?"
"We can\'t find Rosa or Maria‐chan.
 I thought they might be with you."
"...I heard her scoldin\' Maria‐chan in the corridor.
 They got quiet after that, so I thought they went back to the lobby......didn\'t they...?"
"............That idiot..."
Rudolf clicked his tongue.
Other people could be seen in the corridor.
 It had been some time since Rosa went out into the corridor, and she had still not returned, so they had begun to worry.
Near the front door, Natsuhi pointed at the removed chain.
"......The chain isn\'t set.
 They must have gone outside to see the rose after all."
"Going out and leaving the door unlocked, that is simply too careless.
 What a troublesome person."
"...More importantly for now, I\'m worried about Rosa‐san and Maria‐chan themselves."
"Right.
 ......Hey, brats.
 Where was this rose of Maria‐chan\'s?!"
"I\'m pretty sure...it was in the flower bed right in the middle of the rose garden..."
"If those two are there, we should be able to tell quickly if we go."
"......Dad, I think we should bring them back as soon as we can..."
"Of course.
 We\'ll bring them both back and spank them on the butt.
 I\'ll dash out there and come back.
 Lock the door as soon as I go out."
"...Dad, I\'ll go with you."
"Don\'t be an idiot.
 You\'re a brat, and what brats do is they watch the house with Mommy."
"............What is it...?
 Did something happen......?"
"Sorry, did I wake you up...?
 ...Seems like Rosa‐san took Maria‐chan outside.
 ...How reckless of her."
"Rosa and Maria‐chan went...
...outside...?
 Into the rose garden......?!"
"That\'s right.
 ...Oh, I guess you must\'ve heard.
 Maria‐chan was causin\' a ruckus \'cause she wanted to see her rose."
"......Th‐......they mustn\'t,
 ......they mustn\'t go to the rose garden...!
 Tell Rosa to stop...!"
"Th‐there\'s no tellin\' her to stop now, it looks like they left a while ago.
 ......Seriously, how reckless of them."
".........That\'s not it...
 ...Not the rose garden...
 ...There\'s a witch there...
......and she\'s waiting for a sacrifice...!
 Rosa, you mustn\'t go...
......ooooooooooohhh..."
...Eva curled herself up again, holding her head.
......Her complexion looked very bad.
"What is it?
 Did the fever make you dream somethin\' bad?"
"............It was a dream,
 ......yes...
 ............In the rose garden, the witch, doing that to Rosa and Maria......
 .........That\'s right.
 ...It\'s a dream,
 ......yes..."
"Calm down.
 I\'m also in this room.
 The chain is set, too.
 The shutter\'s closed on the window, and there\'s even a gun.
 This room is just like a fort.
 There\'s not a thiiing to be afraid of."
Hideyoshi beat his chest, trying to calm her, but Eva\'s insecure expression didn\'t change.
...Under the covers, Eva kept praying...
that the grotesque nightmare she had just had was only a dream...
"In the center of the rose garden, Rudolf confirmed the bodies of Rosa and Maria.
 After that, he returned to the guesthouse, called for help, and carried both of them into the guesthouse."
"If we can trust Nanjo\'s examination, the cause of Rosa\'s death was a stab to the medulla oblongata with the pointed gate of the fence.
 It is thought that Maria\'s death was due to strangling with bare hands.
 However, due to the "Devil\'s Proof", we cannot discount a misdiagnosis."
"......I will say it in red.
Rosa and Maria died.
The causes of death were as Nanjo diagnosed.
 ......She wasn\'t eaten by a spider, nor was she crushed by a mountain of cake.
 Don\'t worry."
"............So you argue that even though you toyed with their death so much, it\'s all okay because the corpse is clean...
 I definitely won\'t forgive you.
 ...All of that brutal treatment you gave Auntie Rosa,
 I\'ll never forget it, and I\'ll never forgive you for it..."
"...L‐like I said, that wasn\'t me......
 ...I think I gave them a much more peaceful death than the way she treated them..."
"Shut the hell up.
 I don\'t want to listen to you.
 .........I\'ve been told that there are no more than 18 people on this island, and now that eight people are already dead,
 the suspects are narrowed down to ten.
 One of them probably killed those two."
"...Or it could also be an accidental death.
 Like Maria was having a tantrum,
 and when Auntie Rosa tried to stop her crying, she misjudged how much power she was using and accidentally killed her.
 Then, in her consternation, she slipped and fell, landed on the fence, and unluckily, died."
"......How\'s that?
 That way there\'s no need for a witch or magic."
"......Well, that\'s not true.
 Actually, Rosa and Maria—"
"Shut up.
 Didn\'t I say that I didn\'t want to listen to you?
 You\'re an eyesore, so get lost.
 You monster."
Battler said that without rage, ...but with a horribly cold voice.
...Beato had also felt something out of place since the beginning.
In a fight, both of them could go at each other without restraint.
However, he wouldn\'t even step into the ring.
She could feel that coldness.
Beato wasn\'t pleased about that.
...She thought about flaring up, but she held back.
Maybe even though she was innocent and childish,
 she had enough sense to realize that she shouldn\'t fight.
"........................
 ..................Is that so?
 Then I will hide myself.
 ...Ronove, continue for me."
"Certainly.
 ...Will that be satisfactory, Battler‐sama?"
".........There are no problems with that proposal.
 If Battler‐kun says that he doesn\'t want to see Beato\'s face, I believe that will be an acceptable alternative."
"Do what you like.
 ...I couldn\'t care less what you do as long as I don\'t have to look at that monster\'s face."
"......Hey, wait a second.
 ...You keep saying "monster monster", but isn\'t that a mean way to speak of me?"
"......Why do you instinctively hate me so much, Battler?
 None of that was me, it was all the work of my disciple..."
".........It\'s not like I\'m only mad about what happened just now.
 It\'s from the very beginning."
"Come on, Battleer.
 Don\'t misunderstand, alright...?
 Aren\'t we just a pair of players confronting each other through a game?
 ...We look for moves to make things painful for each other, but—"
"Don\'t get the wrong idea.
 I don\'t hate you because you\'re my rival in this strange game about whether I accept you as a witch or not.
 ......I just cannot in any way forgive how senselessly cruel you are."
"That\'s because a serial murder is part of the game...
 It\'s probably impossible to avoid a little cruelty..."
"I\'m not just talking about what just happened.
 The last time, and the time before that too.
 ......Tearing everyone\'s stomach and stuffing it with sweets, plowing their face.
 What was the point of all that?"
"..................That\'s...
well—"
"All this stuff about locked‐room murders and tricks and alibis,
 I\'m willing to give you a pass on all that.
 You want to claim that these are murders done by magic,
 so I\'ll grudgingly accept that those complicated crimes have to occur."
"......But what exactly are all those grotesque murders supposed to mean?"
"............Well, umm,
 ...............nothing much..."
"That\'s right.
 They don\'t mean anything.
 You\'re just fooling around by mangling the corpses for fun.
 That has nothing to do with whether you\'re a witch, or whether it could or couldn\'t be done with magic."
"You\'re just exploring the depths of cruelty for fun.
 I don\'t hate you because you\'re a witch, or anything like that.
 There\'s just some things I cannot forgive as a human."
".........Wh‐
......what do you mean, as a human...?"
"For example,
 ......the six people of the first twilight for this game.
 ...Well, other than Grandfather being burned black,
 the other five corpses were killed in a normal way, without any unnecessary shaming of the dead."
"...It wasn\'t clear whether the weapon was a spear or a gun, but anyways, as far as killing goes, that was permissibly better.
 It was much better than the insanity and cruelty of the first twilight last time, or the time before that."
"And this time, there were six locked rooms tied together to make a locked‐room chain.
 ......That was sort of interesting.
 When we were going back and forth with each other on that, to be perfectly honest, I thought it was just a little fun."
"...You were frantic to make me accept your existence, and I was frantic trying to deny it.
 ......We were both frantically doing all we could."
"This may sound weird, but I even felt a faint sense of sportsmanship between the two of us.
 ...We exist in conflict,
 but I faintly thought that we might not be completely unable to understand each other\'s existence."
".........But just now, that feeling was blown away without a trace."
"Th‐that\'s where you\'re misunderstanding...!
 That wasn\'t me—"
"That\'s not it.
 That\'s not what I\'m talking about!
 ......You watched Auntie Rosa being killed horribly over and over,
 and you sneered at it like it was an interesting show."
.........When I saw that, I was deeply disappointed.
When I realized that your decision to kill them in a slightly better way this time had been nothing more than a little whim,
 ...and that nothing had changed in your cruel character, I was deeply disappointed.
And that\'s not all, you were even genuinely enjoying a brutal death.
You weren\'t just acting as cruel as you could to bully me.
...You truly, genuinely enjoy cruelty.
Your character lets you enjoy it.
You saw Auntie Rosa being brutally killed over and over, and said, isn\'t this fun?
That wasn\'t sarcasm, you enjoyed it from the bottom of your heart,
 wanted to share that feeling with me, and said, isn\'t this fun?
......In that instant, I despaired, and I realized the truth.
"The problem isn\'t whether you\'re a witch or not.
 ......That cruelty of yours is unforgivable to me.
 And I can\'t understand it!
 I can\'t forgive it, either!
 Still, I\'ll continue this game of whether to accept or deny witches.
 I won\'t step down and accept my own defeat."
"However, your pointless cruelty is absolutely not needed for that game.
 So I\'ve decided that I won\'t accept you as my opponent.
 Ronove is a hundred times better.
 He doesn\'t have the same cruel hobby you do.
 Even if he does, he doesn\'t have the awful taste to show it off in front of me."
"......That\'s right, you have awful taste.
 You\'re heartless and cruel, so you can\'t understand.
 That\'s unpleasant in an opponent.
 So I don\'t want to see your face again."
After Battler had finished his rant, Beato was shocked into silence for a long time.
Maybe she couldn\'t understand what she was being told,
 or maybe this was a sign that she was doing all she could in an effort to understand.
For a while, she kept switching between angry expressions, frustrated expressions, bold expressions,
 ......as though she didn\'t even know herself what attitude she should take.
In the end, she made her face into a candid expression, as though she had come to her senses,
 and shrugged her shoulders as though she was tired.
"........................
 .........In that case, do as you like.
 From now on, I will continue this game through Ronove.
 ......You have no complaints as long as I don\'t show myself, right?"
"......For the time being.
 But I definitely won\'t forgive your countless cruel actions up until now.
 So I definitely won\'t accept you.
 For that reason as well, I won\'t back down from this fight you\'ve picked.
 And I definitely won\'t lose.
 ...That\'s all there is to it."
"...............Beato.
 No matter how many more excuses you give, his impression of you will not waver.
 ...I have something to talk about later.
 Until then, stay back."
".....................M‐...mm...
 ...Alright.
 ...Then I\'ll hide myself until I\'m called..."
Looking lonely, Beato turned her back to them, and hid herself.
...Battler watched, a slightly displeased expression on his face.
He thought his argument had been valid, but for some reason, his mood didn\'t clear up.
"......She\'s...
an idiot."
".........That\'s true.
 An idiot, and honest."
"That idiot watched with me as Auntie Rosa was horribly killed,
 and turned around with a huge smile on her face."
"......She really believed that she could laugh with me at that cruel show.
 ...She really believed that I could sympathize with that emotion..."
"Looking at that innocent smile, I felt just horrible.
 ......It would have been much better if she\'d said it with her normal bullying face...
 ...Damn it..."
"Milady has never had the experience of having a friend.
 ......In addition, she has probably never had something spoken to her that strongly."
"Both Madam and I are her attendants.
 No matter what we say, it will not reach her ears.
 For Milady, this is also—"
"To hell with that.
 I don\'t remember ever becoming her friend."
"......That is true.
 My apologies."
".....................
 ......There is one thing I would like to thank you for.
 ...Thank you for not backing down from that child\'s game."
She spoke words of gratitude, but for some reason, Battler made a displeased face.
Then, as though finding revulsion in his own bad mood, he chuckled.
"Now that I\'ve even got witches and demons thanking me, I\'m screwed.
 ......Let\'s resume the game.
 Of course, I don\'t intend to go easy on you."
"I wouldn\'t have it any other way.
 Unlike Milady, I do not get agitated."
"......I\'ve already made my move.
 If we suppose that Auntie Rosa is the culprit and died in an accident, I can deny the witch.
 ......I don\'t want to suspect Auntie Rosa, but for now I\'ll deliberately assume that it was her, just to beat the hell out of Beato."
"I will deny it with red.
Rosa\'s and Maria\'s deaths were homicides."
"Alright.
 ...Why don\'t we start from there.
 ...............Damn, I\'m just not getting fired up."
Since Rosa and Maria had been killed, it had become clear that the murderer was still hiding somewhere,
 trying to add even more murders to this chain.
As he shed tears, Rudolf scolded Rosa\'s body over and over for being reckless,
 but Rosa would never respond to that again.
They decided to place the two bodies in one of the guest rooms, and to seal it until the police arrived...
The second murder, ...no, the murder of the second twilight, had delivered a heavy blow to everyone.
Because it had blown away the optimism that some of them had held—
the thought that "actually, a crime didn\'t occur, and it was all a game or a farce by Kinzo and the servants".
Trying to distract themselves from the sadness of losing the people they loved,
 George and Jessica had spent the whole time since morning talking about every possibility.
......And, they had distracted their hearts...
...by supposing that these murders might actually have all been an act,
 and that Shannon and Kanon were only pretending to be dead.
When the murders occurred again, it destroyed that thought,
 ......and they were once again confronted with the fact that their loved ones had most definitely been killed...
The tears that they\'d thought had died away began to drip down once more, and Battler couldn\'t think of anything to say to them...
After that, to be extra cautious, all of the adults checked that all of the rooms were safe, and that everything was locked.
They made certain that the shutters on all of the windows were down and locked, and they checked that no one suspicious was hiding anywhere.
On top of that, they checked their weapons once again,
 and made sure that each other\'s hearts were prepared, so that they wouldn\'t hesitate to fire off a preemptive shot if they saw the shadow of a mysterious person.
Furthermore, the gun Rosa had been holding had been left near the place she had been found.
Someone had gone out of their way to leave it there, so everyone suspected that it was some kind of trap,
 but when Hideyoshi made ingenious use of a fire iron to fire off a test shot, it discharged without a problem.
When all five shots that had been loaded discharged without any problems as a result,
 it was reloaded with bullets and handed over to the only adult male who wasn\'t armed, Hideyoshi.
However, the fact that it had been able to fire off five shots gave rise to a certain paranoia.
This short barrel rifle could load a maximum of five shots.
In other words, Rosa hadn\'t fired even once.
And yet, the two had probably been killed by someone with their bare hands.
This meant there was a possibility that the crime had been committed by someone whose face they knew...
"......When the first murder occurred,
 I privately thought of the possibility that it was all an act."
"...My apologies to Doctor Nanjo, but if he had actually been in on it,
 and only convinced us that the servants were dead,
 I thought this could have been some massive, elaborate act by Father."
"......After all, unless we assume they were acting, that locked‐room situation of theirs couldn\'t have been created in the first place."
"...We also...
...suspected that.
 ...No,
 ...I still want to believe that\'s the case."
"...............My apologies, ......but that is not so.
 ...I am quite old.
 There may be a chance that I made a misdiagnosis.
 ......However, I would never mistake whether they were alive or dead..."
"I get it!
 Don\'t frickin\' say it out loud, Doctor Nanjo...!"
"......My apologies..."
They couldn\'t know about it,
 but Beato had already proclaimed the deaths of the six,
 ...no, this time the deaths of all victims so far, in red.
That faint dream that it was all a farce, and that the victims were actually alive,
 ......was, sadly, impossible...
"......In that case, it\'s more natural to think there\'s someone hiding on this island who knows the mansion inside out,
 carrying out a crime they\'ve been planning for ages.
 In other words, from the time that the typhoon came to this island and sealed it off from the outside world, there were more than 18 people on this island."
And, of course, they had no way of knowing this either:
That claim of Rudolf\'s had also been denied in red.
There are no more than 18 humans on this island...
"Maybe it makes some sense if we think of it this way.
 ......Essentially, there\'s the possibility that the person who\'s hiding is someone who wasn\'t originally supposed to be on the island right now,
 yet is someone whose face was known by Rosa‐san, and with whom she would let her guard down."
"......S‐
so, for example,
 could it be...a servant whose shift doesn\'t lie on these two days...?"
"Hmm......
 ...It\'s hard to argue with that one.
 After they finish their duties, it is not as though we verify that they leave the island by punching a ticket or something.
 If we suppose that a servant on a shift from a few days ago only pretended to leave the island, and actually stayed here,
 that would be hard to deny..."
"......Rosa‐san isn\'t stupid, if you ask me.
 If a servant who\'s not supposed to be here popped up in front of you, that\'d normally set alarm bells ringing..."
"...............I have a problem with assuming this was a crime by an acquaintance.
 ...Perhaps whoever it was suddenly attacked Rosa from the darkness, and were about to steal her gun.
 Then Rosa fell, hit her head against the fence, and stopped moving.
 The guesthouse was nearby, so they wanted to avoid the sound of a gunshot, and they killed Maria‐chan with their bare hands..."
"......That\'s also a possibility.
 ...Still, even if that is the case..."
"Would they intentionally leave Rosa\'s gun at the scene of the crime?
 I don\'t know what the culprit is armed with, but our guns should be a point of worry for them.
 ...Wasn\'t that a perfect chance for them to thin out our supply?
 Why\'d they deliberately leave it at the scene of the crime?"
"At first, I thought that the gun was a trap.
 ......That\'s what chessboard thinking says it would be.
 By purposefully leaving it, they wanted to make one of us touch it.
 And they must have wanted to make us pull the trigger.
 ...I was sure that it would have some dangerous device to make it explode and cause massive injuries."
"But, it\'s actually alright.
 ......I\'d say, the culprit was probably in a hurry.
 I\'ll bet that right now, they\'re regretting they missed their chance to steal a gun...!"
".........I don\'t like it.
 It pisses me off, \'cause it\'s like a message from the witch, saying she isn\'t even scared of guns."
"...However, in any event, this is a fearsome opponent.
 It should have been obvious to any observer that Rosa‐san was holding a gun.
 To think that they attacked her despite that.
 ......We should not neglect the fact that they are unafraid of guns."
"Mm...
 It is as Natsuhi says.
 ......We should probably be even more cautious than we have been."
"This is just for peace of mind, but...
.........at the time we think Rosa‐san went outside,
 where was everyone...?"
"Natsuhi and I were here, along with Rudolf and Kyrie‐san.
 I can guarantee their alibis."
"Eva and I were together.
 I can guarantee that."
"Me, George‐aniki, and Jessica were together too.
 ......When Auntie Rosa yelled at us to go back upstairs,
 we turned right around and went back to the cousins\' room with our tails between our legs."
"......Back then,
 ...if we hadn\'t let Maria go..."
"Saying that isn\'t going to change anything..."
"............Doctor Nanjo?"
"I, I was reading a book in one of the upstairs rooms.
 ......I was by myself, so no one can verify my alibi,
 but I believe everyone saw me return upstairs with the children."
"...You could say any number of things like this,
 but what if you jumped out the window, attacked Rosa,
 then climbed back up using the rain gutter or something...?"
"D‐d‐don\'t be absurd...
 How could I perform a feat like jumping down from the second story with this old body...or climbing up, for that matter..."
"......Let us stop this...
 Suspecting each other...
 It\'s more important that we trust each other, and, for the children\'s sakes as well, defend this place until the very end."
"Yeah...
 ...It\'s like Natsuhi‐san says.
 .........For now, let\'s stop doubting each other."
"You\'re right.
 ...We may be useless as far as searching for the culprit is concerned.
 ......We can only stay alive until tomorrow, inform the police, and follow their instructions.
 Because the police will definitely expose who the culprit is."
".........What is it, Eva?
 ...Is your body still feelin\' bad...?"
"M‐Mother, what\'s wrong?
 Are you alright...?"
"...Sorry.
 ...It looks like my fever is still strong.
 I\'ll be fine, so leave me alone..."
When they looked, they saw Eva staring at the floor, her breathing harsh again.
...She had been able to act firm for a time, due to the urgency of their situation,
 but it seemed her body wasn\'t at its best after all...
"Yes.
 I killed those two.
 Now, the only ones who know about the gold are us.
 I won\'t give up even a scrap to the other siblings."
"............What have you done......!
 There\'s so much of that gold!
 Giving Rosa and the others their share wouldn\'t have been a problem at all...!"
"It would.
 ...That gold is to be passed on only to the head of the Ushiromiya family.
 And that makes that gold, all of it, in its entirety, the very honor of the head."
"......Putting even the smallest dent in it...
is definitely not something I will permit as the new Golden Witch, BEATRICE.
 ......*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*!"
"...Do you plan to continue these murders according to the witch\'s epitaph...?
 Do you actually plan to kill five more people...?"
"Yes.
 If I don\'t finish that annoying ritual, it seems that my power as a witch won\'t become complete.
 ......Hey, "me"..."
"...The power of the witch is really awesome.
 It really can make all of our fantasies become reality.
 The power to make dreams more than just dreams...!"
"Now that I\'ve learned of this power, I can no longer stop being a witch.
 If I can complete the ritual and make my power whole, I\'m sure I\'ll be able to teach you that feeling too.
 *giggle*giggle*giggle*, *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!"
"Stop acting like an idiot...!
 Haven\'t you played witch enough?
 We found the gold.
 And we\'ve even been promised the position of successor to the head.
 We\'ll probably need to tightrope walk just a bit, but at this point, that\'s a dream that will definitely come true.
 ......Beyond that, what more could you wish for...?!"
"I wanted to become a witch."
"I don\'t know anything about that dream...!"
"That\'s it.
 Because I kept holding on to that dream, I\'ve lived at this age forever.
 ......You threw that dream away by becoming an adult."
"......You thought, no matter how long you waited, the rabbit holding a clock wouldn\'t visit you,
 and you wouldn\'t be able to meet Humpty Dumpty.
 And of course, you definitely wouldn\'t be invited to the land of cards.
 You gave up like that, and so you became an adult."
"And that\'s why you don\'t want to become a witch or anything like that anymore.
 ...You\'ve even forgotten that it was the dream of your true self."
"......Look, just stop it!
 I\'ve already gotten my hands on two dreams!
 The gold and the position of head.
 That\'s more than enough!
 So please, your dream has nothing to do with me!
 Be obedient...!!"
".........No waaaay.
 Magic\'s too much fun.
 .........Besides, those two dreams of yours both came true because of my magic.
 It\'s not fair if my dream doesn\'t come true too."
"I am grateful for your magic, and I accept you as a real witch.
 ......So please, be obedient now and return to the inside of my heart!
 And never appear again!!"
"No waaay.
 ......We\'re both misunderstanding each other, aren\'t we?
 That\'s right, I am not you anymore.
 You are Ushiromiya Eva.
 I am the Golden Witch BEATRICE."
"So I have no reponsibility to go back inside your heart.
 ......I would say I feel like a butterfly who has broken out of her cocoon, namely you."
"............haah,
 ......haah......
 ...Urg,
 ......the fever...
is making my mind cloudy......"
"My inexperience with my magic power is making me support it with your vitality.
 Until I finish the ritual and become a full witch, you might have to bear the burden.
 I\'ll take that in exchange for making two of your dreams come true."
"......It\'s alright, don\'t worry, okay?
 For the remaining five sacrifices, I\'ll avoid your family."
"Let\'s see, Rudolf, Kyrie, Krauss, Natsuhi.
 ...And what about that old geezer Nanjo?
 Perfect, I\'ll kill those five people.
 *giggle*giggle*, could you call this a murder announcement revealed only to yoouu?
 *giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*!!"
Eva finally crouched down.
Hideyoshi rushed up to her, and lent her his shoulder...
"......Are you alright?
 ...Let\'s take it easy and rest!"
"Are you alright...?
 Doctor Nanjo, take a look at Eva...!"
When Nanjo and George tried to approach, Eva made a gesture to stop them.
"...Thank you.
 I\'m fine, Doctor Nanjo.
 I\'m taking medicine.
 ......I apologize for saying this in such an extreme situation,
 ...but let me rest a little longer..."
"Mom...I\'ll lend a hand too..."
"Thank you,
 but I\'ll be fine as long as your father watches over me.
 ......Go back to the cousins\' room upstairs, and don\'t come out no matter what.
 ...Understood...?
 No matter what happens, you must not leave the guesthouse......"
"...Outside,
 ......that...witch is......
uuuuhrg..."
"Don\'t talk anymore...!
 Sorry, everyone, but I\'ll be watchin\' over Eva in the room.
 Call if somethin\' happens."
Hideyoshi and Eva retreated from the lobby.
...Of course, Eva wasn\'t the only one who wasn\'t feeling well.
 They hadn\'t gotten a wink of sleep since the previous night, and had been pressed by tension since the morning.
...They were mustering their energy to protect their families,
 but if they relaxed even a little, surely every of one them would be down and out...
"......Everything has gone as planned so far, but from here on out, it will become difficult, you see?"
"Difficult, you say...?"
"Mm.
 In most cases, as the ritual progresses and the victims increase, they begin to tighten their guard,
 and often, they hole up in one place and stop moving.
 That is extremely inconvenient for us."
"...Are you saying that we witches are inferior to a bunch of Humans in a group...?"
"Witches are never inferior to Humans...
 However, perhaps you could say that times change, and that Humans have gotten their hands on a poison..."
"......This wasn\'t a problem long ago, during the period when witches were believed in,
 but just like that annoyance Battler, people in the current era generally deny magic."
"In other words, their existence itself is anti‐magical.
 As a result, at some point, they grew to possess a toxin inside their bodies that denies magic."
"In other words, you\'re saying that the more Humans there are,
 the stronger that anti‐magic toxin gets, and the greater the disadvantage is for us witches?"
"......The total value of all their hearts\' power to deny magic, in other words their Magic Resistance, becomes the denominator to our Magic.
 Understand?
 Is that a bit too difficult for you...?"
"You\'re joking.
 I understand it truly easily.
 ...In other words, you\'re saying that the more people there are that don\'t believe in magic,
 and the stronger their will is, the greater the dramatic division in the effect of the magic is.
 ......I see, if that\'s the kind of formula it is, I\'ll have to rethink my method of attack."
Fundamentally, magic possesses a vast power.
It can even make a rain of fire fall from the heavens, divide a sea, and reviving a lost life isn\'t impossible either.
However, that power is extremely weak against the toxin that rejects it.
And that toxin has been piling up in Humans since the time they forgot their respect for all things sacred,
 ...until finally, this earth was covered with enough toxin that the miracles of magic could not be displayed.
Thus, witches from across the world were chased from their dwellings.
...They were forced to choose whether to throw away their magic and live as Humans, or live in hiding in remote areas where the toxin of Humans didn\'t reach.
In that sense, Rokkenjima, with its population of only ten to twenty humans, was extremely favorable for witches.
And even more favorable was the existence of the ghost story about the witch who lived in the Rokkenjima forest.
...Essentially, the fear that a witch might exist permeates the island to a certain extent,
 weakening the anti‐magic toxin from the Humans.
A small population, and a margin of possibility to accept a magical being.
In other words, minds that were only weakly anti‐magical.
...Only in the valley where those two converged...could a witch live in modern times...
"I see...
 ......So by this formula, we can say that there are several rules a witch must follow to use her power efficiently."
"The first one is creating a scene.
 Create a murder scene that you couldn\'t imagine was done by Humans, decorate it with occult ornaments,
 make it look very much like a witch exists, and by permeating the people with fear, make them believe that witches exist,
 and as a result, the anti‐magic power and the denominator for the power of the magic will be decreased."
"......I see, so this is why the creepy magic circles of the first twilight were created?"
"Th‐that\'s right, exactly...!
 The gaudy scenes for the first twilight each game are all for that reason.
 It\'s definitely not as though I like cruel things or am doing it for fun..."
"...In that case, Predecessor‐sama,
 this time was a failure.
 You killed them in a very plain way.
 It doesn\'t look like anything more than a simple mystery."
".........You should have damaged the bodies more grotesquely, like you did last time and the time before that, as I heard from Ronove,
 making it look like a fantasy and instilling fear in those people."
".........W‐...well, about that.
 ...I thought it wouldn\'t be artful to do that every time, you understand...?
 Don\'t think too deeply on it, it\'s just a whim...!"
Actually, it really had been her whim.
After being told all that by Battler, she couldn\'t say it out loud anymore,
 but she had decided her method of killing based only on a whim.
No, would it be better to say that she had halfheartedly let Ronove decide?
Because she had left the locked room of this game\'s first twilight to him.
But if Beato had gotten a cruel idea, then she surely would have explored the limits of atrocity even worse than the last game...
"...........................
 For the methods of Rosa and Maria\'s deaths too, you told me to show restraint,
 but that wasn\'t a course of action beneficial to us witches either, was it?"
"In actuality, at the present moment, none of them believe one bit that a witch actually exists.
 They\'re sure that it isn\'t a fantasy, but completely in the mystery genre.
 This turn of events is a failure for us witches.
 ......And it\'s all because, for some reason, you keep doing things in a kinda lukewarm way, Predecessor‐sama."
"Aah... L‐like they say, you should seek out work while you\'re young...!
 This is a test from me to you as your predecessor.
 Challenge it with respect.
 Wahahaha...!"
Beato tried to laugh heartily,
 but it was obviously a fake laugh trying to cover something up,
 and the new witch shrugged, sighing.
"........................
 ...At this stage, it\'s probably too late to reduce the anti‐magic power by creating a scene.
 ...In that case, there\'s another move.
 Having the Humans split up should work."
"Mmhm, that is probably the most effective way.
 The smaller the number of Humans, the more the denominator shrinks.
 As a result, the magic power becomes immediately effective.
 ...In other words, the crucial point from here on will be how to destroy this barricade situation and have them split up into small groups."
"However, they are already very cautious.
 The barricade won\'t be destroyed easily, you know...?
 Both the barricade in Kinzo\'s study two games ago and the barricade in the parlor last time were very stubborn.
 Furthermore, most of the cunning adults have been left this time."
"The situation is more difficult than all the ones before it, you see?
 ......If you wish, I could give you some special advice..."
If the first murder case occurs in a closed circle, the survivors hole up without fail,
 gathering together to observe each other and ensure their safety.
......Worrying about how to break that situation apart is probably the domain of murderers and mystery authors,
 so how ludicrous it is that witches, who are meant to exist at the other end of the spectrum, share in that exact same worry.
For a while, the new witch poked her cheek with her index finger, making gestures as though deep in thought, and eventually spoke.
"...........................
 ......No, I\'m fine.
 After all, it is a test.
 ......I won\'t borrow your moves."
"Mh, ...really...?
 ...The thing is, though, it will be pretty hard to defeat this barricade, you know...?"
"I\'ve already made my move.
 I\'m pretty sure it will work.
 If they\'re smart, then it definitely will."
"I‐is that so......
 You really are excellent...
 I am pleased that my disciple isn\'t hard to deal with."
"My motto is to study things myself before asking other people.
 ......Then, if you would excuse me.
 I have to wait for my prey to get nonchalantly lured out."
"Mm.
 ...Well then, handle it with care."
As the new witch lowered her head, her face blank, she turned into gold butterflies and hid herself.
......Beato looked slightly unamused.
It seemed she was lonely since she hadn\'t been relied on at all.
"...............Not one of them bothers themselves with me.
 .........Hmph.
 You witch apprentice, acting so smart.
 ...I\'ll bet any moment now she\'s going to make some painful mistake and start crying."
"Then, without a doubt, she\'ll finally realize my greatness and follow my teachings!
 *cackle*, until then, I shall watch from above."
She laughed loudly on the outside, but a laugh no one can hear is completely pointless.
Beato started to feel empty, and quickly stopped laughing.
...Ronove chose that time to show himself.
"Excuse me, Milady.
 ......The game of the second twilight with Battler‐sama has ended."
"......Mh, ...I see.
 Good work.
 What was the result?"
"My sincere apologies.
 I was forced to resign.
 ......Battler‐sama\'s claim of "Rosa strangled Maria to death, then died in an accident",
 I struck down in red with "both deaths were homicides",
 ...but I could not repel his chain of moves placing Eva as the principal offender."
"But Eva was sleeping in her room the whole time as Hideyoshi cared for her."
"...He put forth the possibility that Hideyoshi was an accomplice, and that the two worked together to create an alibi."
"He even suspects Hideyoshi...?!
 Couldn\'t you have struck back by saying in red that they were in the guest room at the time of the murder?"
"......I also thought of that, but, in any event, several important pieces might have been taken several moves later.
 ...And, because there is a possibility that this move was part of the preparations made by the new BEATRICE,
 I acted out of respect to her.
 ...My apologies."
"Preparations, you say.
 .........Her mind does seem to be sharp.
 ...Hmm, we can let her do as she likes.
 It will be quite a show to see how far she can go."
"Pukkukukuku.
 I thought you would say that.
 ......I see that your disciple\'s unpleasantness has you in a bad mood."
"That\'s none of your business.
 I wonder how that one plans on destroying this barricade from here on out.
 I shall keep a close eye on her."
"...............Oh, and...
...how was B‐...Battler\'s mood?"
"It appeared as though he had calmed himself down.
 He did say that, after all, he couldn\'t get fired up without you as his opponent."
"R‐really, that\'s no surprise, no surprise at all!
 If I don\'t return for the fourth twilight and after, Battler will probably be lonely himself...!"
"Pu ku ku ku...
 And with that, if you would excuse me.
 ...I must bake some delicious cookies.
 So as to at least enliven the discussion between Milady and Battler‐sama."
"Mmhm!
 That guy really was munching your cookies, wasn\'t he?
 It must be because he\'s a boy that he can eat so much.
 Make a lot of them...!"
"Certainly.
 I shall make enough cookies to bury the table."
"Yes, you do just that!"
"......What\'s going on?
 What did you want to talk about...?"
Kyrie called Rudolf out into the corridor.
 It was obvious that she wanted to talk about something that she didn\'t want the others to hear.
"Umm, I..."
"Yeah?"
".........want to go outside."
