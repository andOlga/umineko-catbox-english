The Book of the Single Truth, sealed in crystal by Battler.
Until I undo this seal, I can\'t even stick the key in the keyhole.
"......You can remove it, right?
 This seal."
"Of course."
They were in a vast, dimly‐lit space.
To sum it up in a phrase, ......it was like a trench in the ocean floor.
No, that\'s not quite right.
 It was......a library.
However, the number of books and the height of the shelves vastly surpassed all of those that existed in the world of humans.
If height is the measure of greatness,
 ...then the gods must surely have been giants taller than mountains.
This place appeared to be a library big enough and grand enough for such gods.
Each individual book was no larger than those from the human world.
However, the shelves holding them stood like the walls of a valley......or a deep‐sea ocean trench.
So, ......Ange and the others looked like little more than a few small butterflies who had wandered into this vast library.
......Like minuscule deep‐sea fish swimming about all alone in an ocean pit.
"This is more like ice than a seal.
 ......If you just steal it away from Battler and put it under the rays of the sun, it will fade away by itself as time passes."
"Isn\'t there some way to just smash it open?"
"......Do you like to thaw your frozen fish by smashing it with a hammer?"
"Sorry, I was always terrible in cooking class."
"......Kitties,
 thaw this seal."
When {f:5:Bernkastel} whispered, from the dark ocean pit deep below them,
 ......several emerald‐green glints appeared and gathered like a school of fish.
{f:5:Bernkastel} threw the Book of the Single Truth down to them, and only after several seconds passed, the school of fish seemed to gather around it and carry it away.
Those few seconds made it clear just how deep this bookshelf trench went.
Ange was once again dumbfounded by this unimaginably vast and godly library...
"We can just let them handle the rest."
"......And you really will let me see what\'s inside?"
"If that is your wish, I\'ll grant it.
 And, of course, I won\'t be able to read it myself without that key of yours."
Ange silently gripped the golden key in her pocket...
This journey has been so long, and so strange.
In search of the truth from twelve years ago, I left my home, ......met President Okonogi, met Amakusa...
......And, at some point, that adventure became part of a witch illusion.
However, here I am.
Ushiromiya Eva\'s diary is here.
The truth written inside it is sitting right before me.
"Rest for a while.
 ......Even I don\'t have enough free time to spend it all with you."
".........Well, I\'m not really tired though."
"Erika.
 ......Serve Ange some tea or something."
"Yes, my master!"
Erika popped into existence out of nowhere and bowed to her master.
".........{f:5:Bernkastel}.
 If, by any chance, you\'re planning to use me and steal both the key and the book, ......you won\'t get off easy."
"H‐how dare you say such a thing to my master?!"
"Sorry.
 After my long experience with witches, I\'ve decided not to trust normal words."
"......Very well.
 I\'ll promise it with the red truth.
 ......{p:1:When the seal on the Book of the Single Truth is dissolved, you, Ange, will be the first to read it}.
 ......Is that good enough for you?"
For some time, Ange considered the witch\'s words, searching for some sort of trap hidden within them...
There was no greater guarantee than a red truth given by a witch.
 Ange understood this well enough.
If one did start to doubt even this red truth, .........there would be nothing left to trust in this entire world.
If one began to suspect even this, ......then even the truth would no longer be truth.
"......Are you still unsatisfied about something?"
"Nn.........
 ......No, I\'m fine."
She would need {f:5:Bernkastel}\'s help if she wanted to read the Book of the Single Truth.
Ange finally realized that she had nothing to gain by complaining more and annoying this witch further...
"......Once you\'ve broken the seal, call me right away."
"Of course.
 I also want to read it as soon as possible.
 I\'ll call for you at once."
Bern spun away from them, then vanished into the dark bookshelf trench.
Ange saw a school of emerald‐green fish appear and follow behind {f:5:Bernkastel}.
 ......Could those be her familiars?
As she stared at the emerald lights that resembled some sort of deep‐sea fish, Ange was poked from behind.
"Let\'s go,
 comrade Ange."
"......You\'re creeping me out, so please just call me Ange."
"Then you can call me Erika‐sama."
"......Let\'s get going, comrade Erika."
The pair began to swim in the direction Erika indicated.
"Swim" seemed a better way to describe what they were doing than "fly" would have.
".........Just what is this place?
 It\'s way too big to be called a library."
"It\'s not like you\'ll be able to remember its name, so why not just call it the library?"
"I\'ll decide what I can or can\'t remember. Tell me."
"It\'s "the Great Witch of Theatergoing, Drama, and Spectating\'s Noble City of Carefully Selected Books"."
"......Yeah, "the library" works fine."
"Knew you\'d say that."
The City of Books.
Yeah, the name fits.
The bookshelves on either side of this canyon are skyscrapers.
If I think of those emerald‐green lights flowing beneath us as headlights on a highway, then this really does seem like a city of books.
"These things aren\'t just books, are they?"
"That\'s right.
 Each volume is packed with an ensemble play.
 ......They look like books from here, but if you open one up, you\'ll find a whole world inside."
".........So, even our long tale is only one of these."
"Great witches who live on a far, far higher plane than we do are hardly any different from a god or Creator.
 ......From their perspective, our little tale is worth little more than a single book, if that."
From the theatergoer\'s perspective, our individual lives are hardly worth anything at all.
If they\'re writing down an entire world in a single volume, ......then my life probably isn\'t even worth a single line.
"But we\'re the main characters.
 ......I am, and so are you."
"That\'s right.
 Even if the tale of the gods doesn\'t mention us,
 ......we are always the main character in the story we write for ourselves.
 .........Becoming aware of that fact is the first thing that separates witches from {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s."
They were on a balcony, which was really a room‐sized section that had been dug out of the bookshelf, with no guardrail along the cliff.
It didn\'t go in very deep, making it look like a room that had been cut in half.
It was filled with the tools of everyday life, as though this was Erika\'s hidden house.
"My master has ordered me to serve you some tea,
 so if you don\'t feel like drinking, I\'ll have to pour it into you with a funnel."
".........If you try, I\'ll have to serve you some matcha."
"Matcha?"
"......Nothing. Just talking to myself."
Ignoring Erika as she made tea, ......Ange looked down upon the bizarre, otherworldly scene below.
Until Erika finished getting the tea ready, the scene held Ange\'s gaze like it was sucking out her soul......
"This might sound strange, coming from me."
"......What?"
"You made a deal to throw away your life to learn the truth.
 That\'s quite something."
".........I had nothing to gain from life.
 It was easy for me to trade away the time I had left."
"My master really does take to idle whims.
 To think she would make a contract for the meaningless life of a powerless girl."
"........................Heh."
Ange chuckled, not bothering to argue.
That was exactly right.
How incredible that {f:5:Bernkastel} would lend her power to a worthless life that was trying to throw itself away.
"Well, my master is the witch who controls miracles.
 ......So, it makes sense that she\'d appear even for a worthless girl like you."
"Good point.
 .........Even if {f:5:Bernkastel} hadn\'t appeared, I would\'ve still taken that step off the edge that day."
"............You really are a cheap woman, aren\'t you?"
"Well then, just how much are you worth?"
"Me?!
 Hahaha, aha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha......"
The way Erika cackled was disturbing.
Still, Ange realized that this was her way of answering the question.
People don\'t become witches of their own choosing.
If they\'re capable of living, all people want to live their lives as {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s.
......When something comes along to trip up that life, ......that\'s when the road to living as a witch opens.
Even Furudo Erika, who calls herself the Witch of Truth, must be like this.
The two Witches of Truth, sitting here drinking tea without even looking at each other, ......are exactly the same.
"I...like exposing the truth."
"I know that."
"I like exposing secrets, then watching those people turn pale as they wonder how I figured it out.
 ......That\'s when I know I\'ve reached the truth, and it\'s a moment of ecstasy."
"There\'s something seriously wrong with you."
"Well then, what does the truth mean to you?"
"................................."
Ange was about to give an immediate answer, but she bit down her words.
And once she did, not knowing the right way to respond, no further words came.
After all, to Ange, the truth itself was the goal.
At first, it was out of hatred.
Could Ushiromiya Eva, the sole survivor of Rokkenjima, be the culprit behind everything?
She hated Eva, but she had no proof that her aunt was the culprit, and of course, Eva never talked about what happened on that island.
......So, at first, in Ange\'s eyes, "the truth" meant proof that Eva was the culprit.
However, that feeling withered away with Eva\'s death.
Now that Eva was dead, even if Ange did find some kind of proof, ......it wouldn\'t mean anything.
So, eventually, the truth Ange wanted to find......became nothing more than the simple desire to know what happened on that island that day.
However, one thing was obvious.
Even if she did find out the truth, ......that wouldn\'t bring any of her family back to her.
"......It might not mean anything at all."
"You\'re going to expose the truth your beloved Onii‐chan is hiding, even though it\'s meaningless?
 You\'re the one that\'s not making sense."
Erika laughed mockingly.
{n}Ange laughed too, as though she agreed.
"And so,
 truth to me became my goal.
 ......Maybe you could even call it my reason for living."
"So, once you do reach the truth, there won\'t be any point or purpose to you living anymore, right?"
"That\'s right.
 So, I\'ll die.
 ......Hasn\'t it been long enough?
 I\'ve already lived twelve years too long.
 Don\'t I at least deserve to have a witch appear and grant my wish in my final moments?"
"............To put it simply,
 you\'re just tired with life—does that sum it up?"
"Yeah.
 So, my reason for living, my very existence, and everything else is meaningless.
 ......That\'s why this goal of finding the Book of the Single Truth has put a little sparkle back into my life, now that it\'s nearly over.
 ......At least on that score, I\'m grateful to {f:5:Bernkastel}."
"I see.
 ......Battler wants you to live, so he hid the goal that would let you die.
 ......I think I pity Battler‐san for the first time.
 After all, you can\'t choose your little sister."
".........................................."
Sorry, Onii‐chan.
I\'m...tired of life.
Twelve whole years.
I\'ve been living off nothing but the illusion that someone might come home someday.
Just let me find peace already.
Finding the truth of that day...... I decided I\'d use that to mark the end of my life.
For twelve years, I\'ve believed in a miracle, but there was no miracle...
I won\'t......believe in miracles anymore.........
"......The Book of the Single Truth.
 Of course, I\'m also dying to find out what\'s in it,
 but from what I hear, it doesn\'t sound like the truth inside is something spectacular enough to mark the end of your life with."
"Yeah.
 .........At first, I hoped there would be something earth‐shattering written in it.
 But now......I guess I\'ve cooled on it."
"Any truth searched for by a worthless person is bound to be worthless.
 It\'ll probably make for a fitting end to your worthless life."
".........Yeah.
 I\'m...sure it will."
Ange was already starting to realize something.
Regardless of why Eva decided not to talk about what happened...
......the real events of that day.........probably weren\'t anything earth‐shattering.
Some sort of malfunction made the bomb in that secret underground base explode.
Yes.
 ......It was just...an accident.
But......the public believed, and hoped, that some sort of plot surrounded the events of that day.
Eva was a suspect herself, so she could claim that nothing strange had happened until she was blue in the face, and no one would believe her.
......Of course, this included Ange.
In that case, ......shutting up like a clam would just make things easier.
It was hardly surprising......that Eva chose to say nothing.
"......Right now, I don\'t feel any sense of accomplishment.
 ......I just feel...sort of worn out and listless."
"Being able to bear the truth is what makes a witch a Witch of Truth.
 .........Comrade Ange.
 It looks like you don\'t possess that strength after all.
 If you did, you wouldn\'t be thinking about dying."
"...........................
 ......You\'re right.
 ......For twelve years, I\'ve clung on to the hope that someone might come back.
 ......I\'ve just used {f:5:Beatrice}\'s cat box to shut away the truth, denying it for twelve years."
"......When you read the Book of the Single Truth,
 I wonder what will happen to you."
"Who knows.
 .........Won\'t {f:5:Bernkastel} carry out the contract by slicing my head off with a scythe or something?
 Or will I be turned into chunks of meat again?
 ......Maybe I\'ll get some salt and pepper this time."
"..............................
 ......I see, so that\'s where the chunks of meat thing came from."
"Did you say something?"
"Nope, nothing at all.
 Anyway, would you like some more tea?"
"No thank you."
Ange listlessly gazed down from the balcony with no handrail,
 ......down into the darkness of the abyss at the bottom of the bookshelf ravine... no, the gap between the bookshelf skyscrapers.
......From the beginning until the end of my journey, .........I haven\'t taken a single step away from this spot.
This journey of mine, not even a single step long, ......will end soon.........
"......Um, what are those lines of lights flowing around at the bottom?"
"Oh, those?
 Probably a group of guests coming to the great Lady {f:5:Aurora}\'s party."
"Guests...?"
"Great Witches from the Senate, Voyager witches who are trying to escape boredom in their endless travels,
 powerful witches who have woken from century‐long sleeps, as well as witches who control the future world and noble witch hunters.
 It seems she\'s planning to hold a grand party tonight."
"......Is it a birthday party or something?"
"From what I\'ve heard, while the great Lady {f:5:Beatrice}, the Endless Witch, may be an outsider among witches,
 she\'s also the genius whose formidable magical system of magic resulted in the creation of "{f:5:Beatrice}\'s cat box", the endless factory capable of producing endless tales.
 ......From my point of view, she\'s just stupid and a weak finisher, but in the world of great witches, she\'s apparently pretty famous."
"So this is {f:5:Beatrice}\'s birthday party?"
"My master says she\'ll be holding a dinner party with {f:5:Beatrice}\'s guts.
 ......After all, it\'s only natural, right?
 The cat box was only able to generate infinite tales because there was no Single Truth."
".........However, tonight,
 the Single Truth will be revealed, thanks to your key.
 And that means the cat box will be opened.
 Really, it\'s no different from slicing open her chest as she still lives and tearing out what\'s inside."
".........Everyone in that huge crowd which looks like a packed freeway is going to one dinner party?
 .........I\'m not sure what\'s stronger, my shock at how famous {f:5:Beatrice} is, or my revulsion at those sleaze‐bags."
"For you, the Book of the Single Truth is nothing more than an end.
 .........However, for all of those enjoying the mystery of Rokkenjima, this is an event that can\'t be missed."
"I see.
 .........So, that\'s a crowd of those goats who\'re chewing Onii‐chan\'s game board apart."
Ange\'s analogy was an accurate one.
The crowd far, far below them......was made up of nobles wearing beautiful outfits and goat masks.
They were all so intent on tearing the guts out of {f:5:Beatrice}\'s cat box that they couldn\'t even hide the drool trickling from their mouths.
Those gluttonous goat nobles, who derived pleasure from violently exposing the truth, were in a line of cars heading towards the meeting place.
".........Looks like this is the end for {f:5:Beatrice} and the cat box."
"......Beato\'s group has holed up in the Golden Land, the last leftovers from the game board.
 Acting as gatekeepers, Battler and Beato have destroyed the first wave, but they won\'t be able to stop the second.
 ......My master has given me an armada capable of destroying the very concept of defensive measures.
 The Golden Land\'s ramparts are as good as gone."
".........Those goats who appeared all over the island... They\'re the personification of random opinions in the future, and all of them want the island\'s tale to be a tragedy."
"That\'s right.
 Those goats keep getting born from the sea of the internet.
 That first wave was just the riffraff.
 The second wave will be entirely different.
 It\'s made up of the best of the best, elite goats selected from the crowd that are capable of denying all the cowering pieces one by one.
 In total, they number in the hundreds of thousands.
 ......A hundred thousand people to deny the existence of a few dozen hiding on an island."
"......Looks like......this is it for Onii‐chan too."
"You\'re ready, though, aren\'t you?
 You understand that Ushiromiya Battler died in 1986, ......and that this man is an illusion created by the cat box."
"............Yeah.
 ......I understand."
Regardless of whether he\'s my real brother or an illusion, ......regardless of whether he\'s who I\'d like him to be or not,
 ......the Battler who created this game board for my sake...will die.
No, it just means that I\'ll accept the fact of his death, so it\'s not like he\'s going to die now......
Ange thought to herself.
Shouldn\'t performing the last rites for her brother......be her responsibility?
This was her final trial, which she had assigned to herself.
All of those people down on the game board......were the personification of Ange\'s naivety.
By denying the existence of all of them, .........wouldn\'t she finally be able to accept the truth?
.................................
No, that\'s not right.
 ......I\'m not being honest, even with myself.
Even if it\'s all an illusion, .........it wouldn\'t make that bizarre Halloween party any less heartwarming.
......Onii‐chan said it himself.
That Halloween party may have been an illusion.
However...
{n}He was trying to use that party to tell me something.........
........................
"About that second wave......"
"My master has appointed me to be their commander.
 ......Leave it to me, Ange‐san.
 My master isn\'t so malicious that she\'d make you dirty your own hands."
".............................."
Yes, that might be kind of her.
.........These are...my lingering attachments we\'re talking about.
I should be grateful to {f:5:Bernkastel}.
If she really were cruel,
 she would probably have ordered me to take charge of the second wave and execute my own family.
"Comrade Ange.
 You are a Witch of Truth, aren\'t you?"
".....................
 ......That\'s right.
 ......Probably."
"Then let\'s accept the truth, okay?
 Finally, after twelve years, the Single Truth lies before you."
".....................
 ......I\'ll just sit around here until {f:5:Bernkastel} finishes breaking the seal."
"You\'ll probably be summoned as a guest for the party.
 ......We\'ve got a mirror, so maybe you should wipe the sleep from your eyes."
"And maybe you should shave before heading out to battle."
It floated in the empty air.
{n}...The door to the Golden Land.
One or two square meters of tiled floor still remained in front of the door, scarcely enough to remind a person that this had once been Kinzo\'s study.
......By now, all of the game board except the Golden Land had been eaten away, leaving only this door floating in a sea of nothingness......
There were two figures in front of that door.
It was Battler......and Beato.
They may not have been literally covered with wounds, but they definitely seemed to be dead tired.
Battler, leaning against the door, seemed to have finally caught his breath.
Beato was also sitting against the door, letting her legs dangle gracelessly.
Could the battle against that force really be called a battle?
It was more like a mere pushing fight on the increasingly small bit of ground that remained.
......They had wanted to protect at least Kinzo\'s study no matter what.
And, the only fruit of their desperate struggle was the tiny bit of flooring that they were sitting on now.
Those goats fell into the abyss whenever they had nowhere to stand.
So now, with so much of the floor gone, there was no way for them to attack anymore.
If Battler thought this, his naive hopes were quickly crushed.
".........Looks like we\'re surrounded."
"So, their plan was to gather their forces and crush us in a single stroke..."
Stretching across the horizon surrounding the door at their backs...
......was an encirclement of countless large sailing ships.
As they could clearly see, the decks of those ships were packed with goats,
 with some of the more foolish and overeager ones spilling over the edges into the emptiness below.
"Dang...
 I\'ve gone through a lot of crazy stuff in your games,
 ......but being surrounded by pirate ships is definitely a first for me."
"......They probably do possess the strength to break through the Golden Land\'s perimeter.
 Those cannons are no bluff.
 Doubtless, they intend to use those to smash through this door and pour in."
Along the sides of each ship were several open gun ports, each with a cannon pointing at the door.
If all the ships surrounding them were joined by even more, and all of those ships fired all of their cannons at once...
......There was no point trying to imagine what would happen next.
Battler and Beato grimaced and hung their heads.
"......How long will the Golden Land perimeter hold out against those cannons?"
"I do not know.
 ......However, since they are still awaiting reinforcements after amassing that many, ......I doubt the barrier will break that easily."
"True.
 I can\'t think of any other reason to delay your attack without even sending terms for surrender..."
"I hope we can take advantage of this time they give us."
"......Time is always the ally of the weaker side.
 After all, we can always hope for a miracle."
"Though it might also give us more time to wither in despair."
At that moment, something small and hard hit Battler in the forehead.
"......Ow!
 The heck is this? Konpeitou candy...?!"
"It\'s me!
 I know where Bern and the others are!"
The konpeitou candy was {f:5:Lambdadelta}\'s transformed body.
She was the only one of their allies capable of crossing the sea of fragments.
"Spectacular!
 That\'s the great Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta} for you!"
"They\'ll be able to see us here.
 Let\'s talk inside.
 ......It\'s getting crazy out there."
"Got it.
 ......Is anyone there?!"
"When Battler knocked on the door, it opened, and Shannon and Kanon came into view.
"You called for us?"
"My apologies, but we need you two to keep a lookout."
"Leave it to us."
"......When they begin their attack, don\'t worry about fighting them.
 Escape to the Golden Land as soon as they start.
 Don\'t worry about closing the door."
"But that means......"
"They\'re planning to ignore the door and smash the Golden Land directly.
 Making a last stand here won\'t do anyone any good."
"......I understand."
"We\'ll take care of things here, so go inside and work on a counterattack."
"Indeed.
 We\'re counting on you."
Battler and Beato traded places with Shannon and Kanon, returning to the Golden Land.
A gentle rain poured down over the Golden Land rose garden.
{n}......The Golden Land\'s weather reflected the hearts of those inside it.
The quietly falling raindrops spoke for the pain felt by those who could do nothing but hide here, waiting for the enemy\'s final assault......
When they returned to the arbor, the konpeitou flew out of Battler\'s pocket,
 jumped onto the table, and returned to its original form.
"I haven\'t had a thrill like this for years!
 Hard to believe I\'d get put in a tight spot like this even after becoming a witch."
"Let\'s get down to business...!
 Just where are Ange and {f:5:Bernkastel}...?!"
"The City of Books."
"......I have heard of it.
 ......They say it\'s a place where all kinds of fragments, collected by great witches who travel the sea, are recorded and stored in the form of books."
"Indeed, the Great Witch of Theatergoing, Drama, and Spectating\'s Noble City of Carefully Selected Books."
"So, the great Lady {f:5:Aurora} is the ruler of the City of Books.
 Truly a suitable place for her."
"Nice going, Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}.
 ......Hard to believe you could pick out that spot so quickly from all the other possible hiding places."
"Actually, it was pretty easy.
 ......I didn\'t even have to search, since they\'re advertising it as loud as they can.
 They\'re planning a huge party where they\'ll unveil the secret to the cat box of the Endless Witch, the great Lady {f:5:Beatrice}."
".........Hmph.
 I see, so they haven\'t been delaying their attack because they await reinforcements, but because the party hasn\'t begun yet."
"So, in this party, they plan to use Ange\'s key and reveal the contents of the Book of the Single Truth?"
"You\'ve got it.
 {f:5:Aurora} hasn\'t held an event like this for ages, and she\'s gathering VIP guests from all over the place.
 ......The Book of the Single Truth will probably be the party\'s final showpiece."
"......So that means we still have a shot at taking Ange and the key back."
"Time‐wise, that may be true.
 However, there\'s a really simple and obvious problem."
"What?"
"The City of Books is a sacred realm under the supervision of the Senate.
 It\'s protected by a holy barrier.
 Only a witch of the Senate can enter it."
"......Aren\'t there any invitees who aren\'t members of the Senate?"
"Yeah, there are.
 It looks like they\'re being given special "invitations", which allow them to enter the sacred realm for a limited time.
"......Invitations."
"My, my, ......now this might be interesting."
"That\'s what I thought too...!
 But it turns out there\'s a strict policy on punctuality, and these invitations automatically become useless unless you present them before the party begins!
 And, I\'m afraid to say the party started a short while ago."
"In other words, it\'s too late to try stealing an invitation from a guest who\'s running late."
"That\'s right.
 ......So, what do we do now?!
 Could someone get me popcorn?
 I\'d like a nice candy flavor this time!"
"As an outsider, I hate to barge into the conversation, ......but we seem to have no options left."
".........We\'re already done for, aren\'t we..."
"Can\'t we do anything except sit here until they attack?!
 There must be something we can do...!"
"That\'s right.
 ......There is just one thing we can do."
".........What\'s that?"
"We can keep on strugglin\' for each second of survival...and hope for a miracle."
"A miracle...?!"
"So, we\'re stuck defending the Alamo."
"We cannot surrender.
 ......Our only option is to hold out as long as we can, waiting for a miracle."
"......Uryuu.
 What kind of miracle?"
"Ange could change her mind...for some reason.
 ......There is a chance, maybe one in several million, that she comes back."
"......Hmph.
 With a probability such as that, it truly would be a miracle."
"We are here so that we can await Ange‐san\'s return."
"Yes.
 ......Ange‐san has nowhere to call home except where we are right now.
 So, we must defend this place to the last minute, waiting for her to come back."
"Awaiting the master\'s return is the duty of a servant...!
 N‐n‐n‐now that it has come to this, I, Gohda, am prepared for what may come...!"
".........Battler‐sama.
 All of us are prepared."
"We of the Chiester Sisters Imperial Guard will fulfill our oath and remain by the great Lady {f:5:Beatrice}\'s side until the bitter end!"
"45 here, no problems!
 I shall fight until the end."
"......Finally, a fitting place to die nyeh.
 ......No problems from 410 nyeh."
"The Seven Sisters of Purgatory will stay with {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama and Battler‐sama until the finish!!"
The six younger sisters also showed their resolve with their eyes.
"Eiserne Jungfrau...
will serve until the {f:5:end}."
"The former SSVD\'s got your back too."
".........And please, lend us your power as well."
"Me?!
 No way.
 Didn\'t I just give you some excellent intel?
 I think I\'ve done more than my fair share, don\'t you?"
"How do you know that Ange‐chan is in the City of Books?"
"I saw her with my own eyes, of course.
 I never trust anything unless I see it for myself."
"Which means you\'re qualified to enter this sacred realm called the City of Books, right?"
"............Indeed.
 The great Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta} is a witch of the Senate, after all."
"{f:5:Lambdadelta}......"
"......What\'s with you guys?
 .........You aren\'t gonna tell me to do more work, are you...?"
"My, what an unexpected development...!"
"Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta} is the only one who can enter the City of Books!"
"And could that possibly mean...?!"
""That this is Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}\'s time to shine?!!""
"Enough kidding around! Are you people crazy?
 ......You\'re telling me to go, all by myself,
 and sneak into there one more time,
 and then bring Ange back out here?!"
The several dozen people surrounding {f:5:Lambdadelta} all nodded in unison.
"How stupid can you be?!
 If I were to save Ange, that\'d mean crashing the great {f:5:Aurora}\'s party, get it?!
 I\'d have the whole world as my enemy!"
"And what\'s in it for me?! Nothing, obviously!
 There\'s nothing you all could possibly offer me...
that\'d be worth getting on the bad side of {f:5:Aurora} and her monster friends...!"
"You\'ll get to see a happy ending, where {f:5:Aurora} and {f:5:Bernkastel}\'s schemes are crushed,
 Ange comes back, and everyone makes peace with one another."
"......What do you say, Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}?
 There could be no greater thrill.
 ......If you pulled off such a marvelous feat, you would be able to forget your illness for a thousand years, would you not?"
"We\'re begging you, {f:5:Lambdadelta}...!!
 Lend us your power!!"
Please, please, we\'re begging you!
 Help us save Ange...!
 Everyone clamored for {f:5:Lambdadelta}\'s help.
They surrounded her and begged for her assistance.
"Please, Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}...!!
 Only you can do this...!!"
"Give us your strength!!
 I\'ll show you the greatest of tales!!
 You\'ll get to see it from the front row!!
 So please, lend us your strength!!"
"Shut uuu{-}u{-}u{-}u{-}u{-}u{-}u{-}u{-}u{-}up!!
 Shut the hell uu{-}u{-}u{-}u{-}u{-}u{-}u{-}u{-}u{-}u{-}u{-}u{-}up!!!"
{f:5:Lambdadelta} leapt to her feet and crushed the cup of popcorn in her hands.
Sweet, candy‐flavored popcorn flew everywhere and pieces stuck to everyone\'s face.
It may have been a hilarious sight.
......However, no one laughed.
{f:5:Lambdadelta}\'s face was filled with a rage that none of them had seen before.
"Could you please stop getting the wrong idea?!
 I\'m a spectator! A spectator!!
 I\'m just a guest who was invited by Beato to come and watch this game!"
"So, why I am supposed to risk my life for you people?!
 You think you\'ll get a happy ending if Ange comes back?!
 Are you really that stupid?!
 Bern and her forces will come sweeping through here, mad with rage, and wipe us all out!"
"There\'s only one reason I\'m here,
 and that\'s because Lion over there said I\'d get to watch an interesting show!!"
"Yeah, and now I\'m sure I\'ll get to see a sublimely interesting tale very soon...!
 A sad, sad tragedy as you fight desperately against Bern\'s forces and get wiped out one by one!
 Oh, I\'m sure you\'ll each get one last time to shine as you\'re torn apart!"
"If I just wait a little, I\'ll get to see all that, won\'t I?
 Pretty soon, all of you\'ll be dead!!
 But not me!
 I\'m a spectator, a guest!!
 There\'s absolutely no reason why I should agree to die with you!!!"
.........No one was able to say a word.
In the still silence, with no sound except that of the rain, ......even {f:5:Lambdadelta} finally hung her head in dismay.
".........Sorry.
 I\'m totally lame, aren\'t I?
 ......Yeah, if I stood up right now and said "leave it to me", my popularity would surge and I\'d probably make it into the top three in the next character popularity contest."
"............But still,
 ......unlike the rest of you, ......I\'m not "one of this story\'s characters".
 ......I can\'t die.
 ......It\'s like it\'s midnight, and you\'re telling me that we\'re almost at the best part.
 But tomorrow\'s Monday, and I\'ve got early cleaning duty at school...!
 We live in completely different worlds...!!
 That\'s why...... You can\'t, like......
 ........................haaaah..............."
{f:5:Lambdadelta} staggered as though dizzy, ......then plopped down into a chair.
Then, she became expressionless like a doll, just staring at a single point in space, silently......
".........Sorry."
Battler softly apologized.
{n}However, {f:5:Lambdadelta} remained expressionless.
"......There\'s still more we can do on our own.
 So it\'s not fair to put pressure on you alone to risk something."
"...................................."
"We\'ll fight here and defend this spot until the last moment.
 .........We\'ll believe in the miracle of Ange choosing us over the Single Truth.
 ......If we aren\'t prepared to do that, we\'re in no position to ask you to give up your life alongside us."
Battler rose from his seat and spun around.
"......Battler..."
"I\'ll switch places with the pair outside.
 ......When they come, I want to be in the front lines.
 That\'s the fastest and most direct way I can show {f:5:Lambdadelta} my determination."
"................................."
"I shall go as well.
 Master, please find Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta} some more popcorn."
"......Beato..."
"I know Ange will return.
 If we don\'t believe, even a possible miracle will not bear fruit.
 You can\'t win a lottery unless you buy a ticket."
Beato also stood up and followed Battler.
"......Everyone,
 let\'s do what we can to prepare for the fight."
"I agree.
 Nothing stupider than just sitting around here...!"
"Good point.
 If we\'re reaching the end, let\'s put on a good show."
".........We\'ve got to make sure there\'s a place Ange‐chan can call home."
"And we should hold a strategic {f:5:conference}."
"Yeah.
 We have furniture, weapons, demons, and Inquisitors.
 Must be some way for these mismatched forces to cooperate."
"Let\'s go, little sisters.
 Break time is over."
"Chiester Troops, rise."
The {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s and the fantasy creatures all rose to their feet and left the arbor.
Afterwards, only {f:5:Lambdadelta} remained, still staring blankly at a point in empty space......
"That black tea smells nice.
 Is it instant? Or from a tea bag?"
"......Oh, would you like some too, comrade {f:5:Eva}?
 We have no more cups, so you\'ll have to use a funnel."
A gold butterfly drifted onto the balcony and turned into {f:5:Eva}.
"How\'s {f:5:Bernkastel} doing?
 Will it be a while longer before she breaks the seal on the Book of the Single Truth...?"
"That\'s what I came to talk about.
 She says the seal has been broken."
".............................."
"Congratulations. So, the time has finally come.
 ......The period to mark the end of your life."
"Take the key and go to Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}.
 ......One of her cat familiars will guide you."
Two emerald sparkles flew in.
{n}They were the green, glinting eyes of a black cat.
The cat flicked its tail elegantly, with the dignity of a high‐class attendant.
"......Got it.
 Then, I\'ll be back in a bit."
Ange rose from her seat.
She did it casually, as though she really was just heading out for a short trip.
However, her lips would never touch her half‐finished cup of tea again...
"We weren\'t together long, but I enjoyed it.
 It was a very enlightening experience, to learn what disgust for your own kind feels like."
"Same here.
 ......Next time we meet, you\'ll have to teach me the trick to making tea this terrible."
"......Are you happy?
 Now, you\'ll finally get to learn that secret I\'ve been hiding from you these past twelve years."
"I am happy.
 ......Yeah, now I can understand how Erika feels.
 ......It feels like I\'ve taken a shot back at you, exposing the secret that you kept until your death."
"And is that a good feeling?"
".........Well, it\'s better than nothing."
Ange nodded towards the black cat to let it know that she was ready.
The cat nodded back in a refined manner, indicated that it wanted Ange to follow, and leapt from the balcony.
Without turning back, Ange followed it, jumping out into the air as though swimming...
{f:5:Eva} watched her go.
An expression of ridicule and scorn...was not the one that crossed her face...
"Good luck, Ange.
 .........This is the path you\'ve chosen.
 ......You aren\'t six years old anymore.
 You\'re eighteen.
 ......Choose how to live your own life."
"...............What an overprotective aunt you are."
"I\'m going to watch the ceremony.
 What about you?"
"It\'s almost time to begin the attack, so I\'m heading for the ships.
 ......I\'ve got to go pick up Beato\'s corpse.
 The guts will go to the party.
 I get to keep her skin, so let\'s stuff and mount it."
"So, this is the end to the mysterious tale of Rokkenjima."
".........Which means that it\'s also the end for you. I mean, you are a piece from there, right?"
"A piece is all I am.
 The role of a piece is to remain faithful to its role until the game ends.
 ......It\'s not a piece\'s place to worry about what happens after the game is over."
"True.
 ......And it\'s the same for me.
 .........Let\'s both enjoy this time while we have it.
 Well then, allow me to take my leave."
"Later. Good luck with your work."
After exchanging elegant bows, the two witches vanished at the same time.
Nothing remained except some half‐finished tea cups and the aroma of the tea itself......
One after another, luxury cars stopped in front of a high‐class hotel in the city, and guests began to step out of them.
"Hey, Professor Ootsuki...!"
"Oh, what a surprise!
 I haven\'t seen you since the last convention!"
All of the guests gathered here were very rich and cultured.
A single hobby tied all of them together.
They were the Witch Hunters.
Like‐minded people who enjoyed exploring various interpretations of the Rokkenjima mystery.
"Still, I wonder if it\'s really true.
 It\'s hard to believe that Ushiromiya Eva\'s diary actually exists...!"
"It really is. I had heard rumors of it myself.
 A secret diary said to have been hidden away by Ushiromiya Eva just before her death...!
 Rumor has it that she wrote the details of Rokkenjima\'s truth in there.
 It reminds me of that fable of the king with the donkey\'s ears.
 Humans truly are tragic creatures, incapable of keeping quiet about a secret even if no one else could possibly learn of it."
"Waha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha.
 From what I\'ve heard, a collector from Dubai offered to buy it for ten million dollars...!"
"Incredible...!
 More evidence of the fascination that the Rokkenjima mystery is capable of stirring!"
Conversations like this were breaking out passionately all over the place.
Furthermore, the guests weren\'t the only ones pouring in.
{n}The press was also there in force.
The Rokkenjima mystery had created such a large movement that, at one time, it became a social phenomenon.
Though that had died down slightly in recent years, it was still a topic fiercely debated across the internet.
It was hardly any surprise that the discovery and imminent release of Ushiromiya Eva\'s diary, which contained the truth of that mystery, had caused an uproar.
And on top of all that, the mysterious Forger Itouikukuro was to appear publicly for the first time.
 In fact, it seemed that Itouikukuro and Hachijo Tohya, the up‐and‐coming mystery novelist, were the same person.
Of course, this meant that Hachijo Tohya would also be appearing in public for the first time.
The fact that she was actually an enigmatic female author, despite having been thought to be male, would have been enough to cause a stir on its own.
Before the diary unveiling party, a press conference was held in one of the rooms of the hotel.
"......Indeed.
 I am Hachijo Tohya."
"We now know that in your previous book signings, you went to the lengths of using a double to avoid appearing in public.
 What has caused you to change your mind and appear before us this time...?!"
"The legend of the Rokkenjima witch has given birth to endless tales.
 ......Considering the weight of such a legend\'s demise,
 and being the mere writer that I am, I felt obligated to show myself as a sign of respect."
"As a Forger, you announced on the web that you had reached the truth!
 Does that mean you have already read the contents of that diary?!"
".........And, very soon, those contents will be revealed to everyone."
"Pardon me for asking,
 but is there solid proof that the contents of this diary are the truth?
 It seems that some are claiming it to be no more than the personal account of a single deceased person."
"That is not the case.
 I guarantee it.
 {p:1:The truth is written in this diary}."
A stir passed through the crowd, and the room was suddenly filled with camera flashes.
"This ends Hachijo\'s interview...!
 Allow us to express our deep gratitude to all members of the press for coming today!
 And now we would like to move on and allow you to take photos of Madam Ushiromiya Eva\'s diary."
A hotel worker pushed forward a cart covered by a veil.
Then, after looking to Hachijo for approval, he removed the veil.
There lay.........Ushiromiya Eva\'s diary.
{n}The Book of the Single Truth sat there, waiting for its seal to be broken.
Hachijo held it to her chest and laughed enigmatically.
Camera flashes came from everywhere, making the Book of the Single Truth glint......
"And that is all for now!
 If you would all please move to the assembly hall...!"
Still holding the diary, Hachijo left the press conference room, escorted by men from the hotel.
Until she went through a door that said "No Entry Unless Authorized",
 the journalists continued to surround her and ask questions, hoping to gather just one more comment.
When the door slammed shut, .........the world twisted.
The hotel employees became black cats wearing capes.
Hachijo had turned into {f:5:Featherine}...
"Things are getting pretty crazy out there.
 ......Did you enjoy it?"
"......It was tiring.
 ......Though not a bad experience.
 I must say, though, this diary truly is heavy."
{f:5:Featherine} tossed the diary, and {f:5:Bernkastel} caught it.
"I will rest in one of the waiting rooms."
"You\'re up again pretty soon.
 There\'s no time to rest."
"......In that case, call it a short break so that I can properly enjoy this long‐awaited excitement."
"I need to borrow that book.
 I promised Ange that I\'d show her first."
"I see.
 In that case, do as you please."
{f:5:Featherine} left, followed by her cat attendants.
After watching her until she was out of sight, {f:5:Bernkastel} disappeared as well.
Like Erika\'s room, {f:5:Bernkastel}\'s was a balcony without a handrail, dug out of a bookshelf cliff.
Ange had been kept waiting for some time, but she had waited patiently, looking down at the world below her...
{a:c:
"......I\'m late, aren\'t I?
 Sorry about that."}
After {f:5:Bernkastel} appeared, the black cats gave a bow and vanished.
"Here you go.
 I\'ve brought it with me.
 The Book of the Single Truth."
".....................
 ......Can I touch it...?"
"Do as you like."
{f:5:Bernkastel} set it on the table and beckoned Ange forward.
Slowly, ......Ange approached it.
"So, ......this is Aunt Eva\'s diary......"
"That\'s right.
 ......Inside it, you\'ll find the Single Truth that you wanted.
 ......You do have the key, right?"
"Yes.
 Right here."
Ange took the key out, looked at it there on her palm, then gripped it tightly.
Even that heavy lock that held the diary so securely...was fated to be swept aside easily as soon as Ange readied herself...
"I won\'t rush you.
 You don\'t have to open it until you\'re ready."
"......In here, there\'s the truth of what happened on October 4th and 5th, 1986, right?"
"...............Yes.
 Everything that you offered up your life in the hope of learning is there."
In that instant, inside of Ange, two Anges appeared, taking control of her body at the same time.
On the one hand, she knew that she had already paid a great price to learn the truth.
This part of her gripped the key, wanting to act quickly to prevent the moment of hesitation that might lead her to refuse to learn the truth now,
 at the final moment, with the Book of the Single Truth right before her.
On the other hand,
 ......a feeling that she was betraying the brother and family that watched over her warmly made her bite her lower lip.
However, though she shook, she could do nothing but watch as her right hand slowly brought the key towards the lock.
"................................."
"......................................."
What am I hesitating for...?
Inside this diary, there\'s the final destination of my sad, painful, twelve‐year‐long journey.
Was twelve years not enough of that? Do I want to keep living that way...?
That Onii‐chan, and all those others—those are all illusions created by my heart.
 ......My naive hope that a miracle might still occur.
If I put my two options on a scale, then the path I should choose is clear.
Slowly, ......I pushed the key into the lock.........and twisted...
The lock opened with a click, ......and at the same time, it felt as though a crack ran through the key in my hands.
Maybe a part of its intricate design had broken off.
{n}I couldn\'t tell where it had broken just by glancing at it.
However, for some reason, its golden glint seemed dulled somehow.
"......It\'s because you\'ve made your choice with that key.
 A bit of magic has disappeared."
"What kind of magic?"
"Didn\'t Battler tell you?
 He said you couldn\'t hand that over to anyone else.
 ......That magic, which "left the decision to you", has just fulfilled its role and disappeared.
 That key is just a key now.
 It can\'t do anything but lock and unlock that diary."
".........I see.
 Then, I guess I have no more use for Onii‐chan\'s key."
"Can I have it?
 Once you\'ve read the diary, I\'ll lock it up again.
 Opening that lock will be a big part of tonight\'s ceremony, it seems."
"......I see.
 Do whatever you want."
I don\'t give a damn what happens after I find the truth.
{f:5:Bernkastel} slid the key from where it lay on the table and put it into her pocket.
"Go ahead, then.
 .........Before the courage that led you here fades."
"................................."
I lifted up Aunt Eva\'s now unlocked diary.
The lock was open.
 Even the hinge had been released by now.
......There was no longer anything standing in the way of me opening to the pages within...
I thought of taking a deep breath.
 However, I decided against it.
......I prepared myself for this long ago.
So stupid to fuel my reluctance further.
I opened it.
 Violently, ruthlessly.
I knew...that this was the right way to open to the truth that awaited me inside.
As soon as the cover was opened, ......a brilliant light poured out, and my mind went hazy.
The truth was sent to my mind directly, without letters or words......
Tell me......what happened that day............on Rokkenjima......
My consciousness......returned gradually.
Nothing was written in the open book before me.
Of course.
 This was......my own blank and empty notebook.
I was at school, just sitting idly with my notebook open.
The world had stopped.
The hands on the clock had stopped too.
In that case, the auditorium should have been filled with silence.
However, I could hear a small commotion.
In this world of suspended time, ......I could see dark shapes sneaking about behind the unmoving students.
They were.........students with goat heads.
They were sneaking glances at me from behind the frozen students, whispering something to each other.
I know.
 I can hear them.
Everybody...everybody knows.
One after another, students with goat heads slipped out from every conceivable hiding place.
They slipped around all the students stopped in time...and gathered around me.
Then, they all jeered out things in an endless stream, and, possibly aware that I could hear, showered me with giggles and sneers and comments amongst themselves.
However, nothing that came from the goats\' mouths reached my ears as words.
This was a world without letters or words, ......so no words reached me.
However, their emotions and meanings did reach me.
So, I knew what it was they were saying.
And then, when I was able to visualize it, .........this happened...
One after another, the goats opened their massive jaws, showing their fangs that dripped with saliva,
 ......and came forward to bite me.
Time was stopped for me.
{n}I was aware, but I could not move.
......Literally, that wasn\'t true.
However, I was pretending that I couldn\'t hear, ......so I couldn\'t move.
The goats bit me all over my body, leaving their fang marks, licking me.
Maybe they didn\'t like the taste of my clothes.
Taking advantage of the fact that I couldn\'t move, ......they chewed through my clothes one by one.
Over and over again, ......the goats stuck their tongues, their jaws, their fangs into my naked body.
I was covered with drool and bitten all over.
Bright red teeth marks were left behind as sharp fangs pierced my skin, leaving trails of blood.
They licked up that blood like real goats, ......hurting and humiliating me.
As I hung my head, one of the goats pulled on my hair, forcing me to look up, and spoke.
This time, it wasn\'t conceptual, but words I could hear.
However, they weren\'t words of the human world.
 They were a witch\'s words.
The red truth, which signifies absolute truth.
‘This is...{p:1:the truth of the Rokkenjima incident}!!’
"............I won\'t accept it."
‘It doesn\'t matter if you accept it or not!!
 This is the truth!!
 {p:1:After all, *********, ******************!!
 *********************************}!!!’
"......I won\'t accept it, I won\'t! ......I\'ll never accept a truth like that, ......never......"
‘{p:1:Whether you accept it or not, that doesn\'t change the truth!!
 After all, this is the Single Truth, proven in re{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}eddd}!!’
*giggle*giggle, ......heh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eheh, hah{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha...!!
Who cares about the truth, so stupid, so pointless...!
{n}I\'m the one who gets to decide if that\'s the truth or not, right?
Even if it\'s red truth, I won\'t acknowledge it, won\'t permit it, and I definitely won\'t accept it...!!
"The red truth is absolute?!
 Who is it absolute for?!
 It\'s absolute for you guys, right?
 It\'s not absolute for me!!
 I won\'t let you contaminate my truth with yours!!"
".........Ange, calm down.
 You\'re the one who wanted to know, right?"
"Hahahaha, ah{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha!!
 My truth is that Aunt Eva\'s the culprit!!
 Aunt Eva killed everyone!!
 Everything\'s her fault!!
 Dad and Mom and Onii‐chan and all the others are just victims...!!
 It\'s no one\'s fault, no one\'s fault...!!
 How could it be? How could it be?!"
― Your aunt will always be on your side, Ange‐chan.
"Hahahaha, ah{0}hah{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha!!
 Yeah, I get it now, I know what you meant!
 Heh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eheh, ah{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hah!!
 That\'s right, Aunt Eva, you\'re the culprit, you\'re the culprit!!
 It\'s the world that\'s messed up and broken for not realizing that...!!
 I\'m the right one, I\'ll deny the red truth, deny the whole world...!!!"
".........Oh?
 ......In that case, try writing a red truth that only you can write.
 ......But how is it possible for a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} to write with red truth?"
"It is possible!!
 There\'s a red ink that only {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s can write with!!"
Ange‐san, please calm down.
"I\'m the right one!! The world\'s wrong!!
 I\'ll write it!!
 I\'ll write the truth with the real red truth!!
 Haha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hah, aha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha!!"
20, requesting urgent support on the roof!!
Ange‐san!!
 Wait!!
 Don\'t be hasty, look ooo{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}ouuuut!!!
"<Goodbye, Ange. Have a nice day.>"
"I\'ll write it out! This is my blood‐red truth!!
 I\'ll never accept the truth of your woo{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}orld!!!"
Ange\'s body went past the edge of the balcony.
The air, which she had once been able to swim through, was now completely merciless for some reason.
Ange\'s body......plunged straight into the darkness below.
"................................."
{f:5:Bernkastel} just watched the scene play out in silence......
Behind her, men in black suits rushed up to the fence, clutching it and screaming...
"T‐......this is 20......!
 ......A‐......Ange‐san......j‐jumped off...!"
"Damn, ......I can\'t see her from here..."
"Q‐quickly, investigate the ground area...!!
 It\'s no use, there\'s no way...!!"
"M‐...maybe she was caught by that safety net...!
 L‐let\'s make sure...!"
What fools.
If you jumped straight down from this height, ......do you really think such a flimsy safety net could possibly save you......?
"As the Witch of Miracles, I, {f:5:Bernkastel}, guarantee that such a miracle certainly won\'t occur.
 .........*giggle*giggle*giggle*, ......hah{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haa{0}ha{0}haha!!"
Ange\'s body......fell from the skyscraper‐like bookshelf and slammed against the floor of the City of Books.
Looking down from {f:5:Bernkastel}\'s balcony, which was as high as a skyscraper\'s roof,
 ......could it have looked like a lovely, red pressed flower?
It couldn\'t have looked like anything.
In the same way that the death of a single lonely girl who rejected the world and died alone......wouldn\'t leave an impression on any of the world\'s people.
She probably died instantly.
It was only natural.
 She had fallen straight down from such a height, after all.
......Is it even conceivable that she wouldn\'t die instantly after something like that?
The index finger on the right hand of her corpse was stuck out as though it had traced something.
Could it be that, by some impossible miracle, she really had escaped an instant death?
And in her final moments, ......using the ink of the red blood draining from her, could she possibly have written her own personal red truth?
However, no one would ever be able to tell what she had written.
After all, ......the red blood pouring from her corpse had run over it all.
"............Even this...was your decision,
 .........Ange."
{f:5:Eva} was looking down at the beautiful flower of blood radiating from Ange\'s corpse.
"......I tried to give you a chance to live.
 ......But you never truly made an effort to live in the future that began after the age of six.
 .........And so, after twelve years, you\'ve finally returned to where you started."
The eyes on Ange\'s corpse...were closed.
......However, there was no way of knowing if this was a peaceful thing.
Slowly, the corpse began to break down.
By the end, it had become a messy lump of flesh, with only a few parts recognizable as human.
......It was hardly surprising.
How else would she look after falling from that height......and slamming against the asphalt?
"You managed to die.
 ......However,
 this doesn\'t mean that everyone will be waiting for you in heaven.
 ......After all, you reached this place by rejecting all of those in heaven.
 .........<See you in hell>.
 No, that\'s probably where we are right now.
 .........So long, Ange."
"Ah, {f:5:Eva}.
 Perfect timing."
"Did you call for me, my master?"
"Dispose of this scrap meat for me, if you wouldn\'t mind.
 I\'m going to put this back."
In {f:5:Bernkastel}\'s hands was the key, which had lost its magic when Ange had made her decision, and the Book of the Single Truth, which had been locked up again.
"As you wish, my master."
After looking down one more time, {f:5:Bernkastel} vanished.
Once she had gone, {f:5:Eva} summoned some cat familiars and ordered them to clean up.
The black cats gathered Ange\'s flesh and scattered limbs and threw them into a tin bucket.
.........Even in this miserable form...
{n}Ange\'s soul......was still living.
Perhaps "living" is a poor description.
She...was unable to die.
 From now on, forever.
She would drift along in the deepest depths of oblivion, covered by the dust of oblivion, until she finally......disappeared.
She continued to question herself.
What did the truth mean to her?
{n}What was right, and where was the place she could call home......?
As her flesh began to cool, even the energy to ask these questions...began to fade...
Eventually, ......she would forget her everyday memories, and even the reason why she was suffering.
However, there was one thing she would never be able to forget.
That was...the anguish.
From this point forth, ......she would suffer endlessly without even knowing why.
By the time the cats finished flinging her corpse into the bucket and dumping it into the sea of nothingness,
 ............Ange had forgotten even her own name.........
.........What\'s this sound I keep hearing?
Yes, it must be............the sound of rain...
In that case, what are those two bright lights coming towards me?
......I don\'t know.
However, they came at me with a screeching sound...and stopped right in front of me.
A blaring noise came at me over and over.
Whatever\'s shining those bright lights...is threatening me.
{n}It\'s probably telling me to get out of the way.
However, I was incapable of moving even a finger......
