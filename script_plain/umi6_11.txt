Rosa could be seen in the parlor.
It seemed that the relatives all wanted to be alone now that they had dispersed for a short break.
Since everyone had avoided the parlor, the obvious place for people to gather,
 Rosa was able to have this relaxing and comforting room all to herself...
That didn\'t mean she looked relaxed.
Her expression was heavy with gloom and weariness.
The cup of black tea that she had brought from the dining hall had gone stone cold......
"................................."
......Comforting silence.
Now that no one else was in sight, Rosa\'s heart finally awoke.
She was always treated like a kid in the conferences with her three siblings.
She had no influence at all.
But, possibly because of that, she was apparently considered to be a neutral party.
The siblings would often ask for her agreement, sometimes even treating her like an adjudicator or a judge.
"......I have to make use of that...
...and turn the discussion in the direction I want."
I have to find almost a hundred million yen by March.
That was supposed to be my great commitment, a burden I bore to help support......his business.
Now, ......I\'m not sure anymore.
If I can pay off the debt, ......will he call me again?
......Well, you can forget it.
Even if you do contact me after all this time, ......I\'ll be the one turning you down.
......But still,
 .........you are Maria\'s father, you know......?
Please come and see her,
 ......if only just once......
"......Love is quite a difficult thing...
......to stick to, isn\'t it?"
"Huh?!
 Wh‐.........who.........?"
Though no one should have been in the parlor, someone suddenly spoke to Rosa, and she jumped.
......Just when had it happened...?
 Kanon could be seen standing there.
Even considering that she had been deep in thought, ......to think that she hadn\'t noticed him at all......
"......You scared me.
 ...Sorry, I guess I was thinking so hard that I didn\'t notice you.
 ......Need something?"
"No.
 .........The reason you are currently in pain is because of love, Rosa‐sama.
 ......Am I wrong?"
"Th‐that\'s sudden.
 ......I\'m not sure what you\'re talking about."
"......Maria‐sama\'s father asked you to be the co‐signer on a loan,
 and you accepted."
"...........................
 ...What a troublesome kid.
 ......You were listening to Krauss nii‐san from the hallway, weren\'t you...?"
......True, earlier this day, in this very room,
 Krauss had seen through to the fact that Rosa was bearing a massive debt because she had become a co‐signer on a loan.
However, he hadn\'t said that her partner had been Maria\'s father......
Why......did Kanon know so much......?
"You are a very wise person, Rosa‐sama.
 ......You wouldn\'t have become a co‐signer...
without thinking carefully about the consequences."
"...............I hadn\'t yet moved to his family register,
 but I thought of the man I would soon marry as my partner.
 If he couldn\'t borrow the money without my name, I figured that helping him out was my responsibility as his future wife."
"......And did that future ever come?"
".............................."
No, it hadn\'t.
So afterwards......Rosa was always alone.
And Maria......never had a father.
However, time moved on.
Maria, who should have been a symbol of their union, just kept growing,
 almost like a living hourglass measuring the length of the hell Rosa had crawled through......
Because of that, Maria\'s growth......hurt.
"......It\'s a cruel joke.
 ......I tried to forget that man several times.
 ......But you know, forgetting him doesn\'t get rid of that debt."
It was only natural.
 ......And so, whether or not she forgot her love,
 she had to do all she could to pay that money back.
"But you know, I also think of it this way.
 .........If I can manage to pay everything off, ......it\'ll mean that I\'ve passed the trial of love that he gave me.
 ......If I have to pay off my debt anyway, how can I abandon my reward, the love I could gain as a result, before it\'s over...?
 Don\'t you think I could put off thinking about that until after I\'ve paid it all back......?"
"..........................."
It may have been a trick of words that only those who have suffered through love could understand.
Even Rosa vaguely realized that she might have been deceived.
However, if she was able to succeed in paying back the loan, ......he might acknowledge her usefulness as a wife...
When that happened, she might be able to regain her love.
But if she had already abandoned that love, then what?
......This debt, this "trial that he had given her", would become completely meaningless......
Yes, for her, ......the debt itself appeared to be a trial of love.
In fact, the very fact that she looked at it that way might have been her blindness due to love,
 as well as proof that she still hadn\'t cast off her infatuation with the past...
Even now, she still suffered......
And that suffering would continue, ......at least until she paid back the massive loan, and let a good deal of time pass after that,
 ......until she could finally lay her feelings for him to rest...
".........Could this be......that hell Kyrie‐sama spoke of?"
"......Probably.
 ......Though I\'m not sure what you\'re talking about.
 ......There\'s no doubt that my world has been a total hell."
"And how can that be put to an end...?"
".........Who knows?
 If anyone did, ......the disease called love would never eat into anyone again."
That disease is a serious one.
......It sometimes eats into a person for their entire life, .....spreading to and hurting the people closest to them.
That disease was torturing her now as much as it ever had...
"Well, since you bring up Kyrie‐san,
 .........her story is like an aspiration to me, ......or a dream."
Though she had her man stolen from her, she persevered for 18 years.
She never fell to despair, and instead continued to support Rudolf, lying in wait for a miracle......
"Maria is still only nine years old.
 ......I\'ve only waited for the first half of Kyrie‐san\'s 18 years.
 ......If I gave up after just this, ......she would laugh at me."
"......Do you think that a miracle will occur in another nine years?"
"..............................
 ......Doubting that would be the end of me."
"..........................."
"In a sense, I\'m a ghost.
 ......I am already dead.
 I\'m just living on without noticing."
".........A ghost waiting for eternity for a person who will never come......"
"That\'s right.
 .........That day, when I naively said that I wanted to support his dream, I was probably already dead.
 .........I guess that really was a regretful day, in the end.
 "I have dreams. I want to go overseas.
 I\'ll fly out of this tiny country, make it big, and come back to you."
 ......That takes me back..."
......At that time, I thought of lovers as a pair of people willing to acknowledge the other\'s radical dreams.
I\'d become a successful designer, announcing my new lines in Paris,
 getting jostled by the press...... He loved to talk about that dream, and I loved listening to him.
When I think about it, ......I really had my head in the clouds during that strange time.
............We both lifted the other up, as though we were drifting about in the air.
So, when he said that he wanted to get out of Japan, I applauded him and promised to support him.
Acknowledging each other\'s great dreams that might never be is a standard sort of pillow talk for lovers.
But once they started to translate into actual action, ........from that point on, I should have been serious and practical.
"......For a long time, I felt proud of letting him go on that day.
 ......No, I still do."
".....................
 ......But you still regret it."
".........That\'s right.
 .........If, on that day, I had sobbed and pleaded for him to stay, I might not have fallen into hell.
 ......Did seeing him off with a smile really make me a winner?
 Of course not.
 I basically lost by default by refusing to fight when the time came."
"...I only glorified that loss, ......saw him off with a smile as he went to take on the world overseas,
 and became intoxicated with the fantasy that I was some brave woman waiting patiently with her daughter for her man\'s return.
 .........Even though he never called me once after that, and mail sent to the address he gave me came back "forwarding address unknown"..."
"..........................."
"......Where I am right now...is hell.
 ......A hell where I\'ll regret until the day I die that I didn\'t fight when I was meant to.
 ......I\'ve even dragged my daughter into hell with me.
 ............I wish someone would just kill me.
 ......I want to be told that I\'ve already been killed, that I\'m a ghost."
"............In love,
 ......if you do not fight,
 ......you fall into hell."
"......Yes. Love is a fight."
"Will you win and gain,
 or lose and die?"
"But please, have no fear of death."
"After all, it is a peaceful sleep."
""What is truly terrifying...
...is the hell that finds the unsleeping ghosts who could neither win nor die.""
"......That hell has no end..."
"The battle of love is cruelest to those...
who could neither win nor die."
"......So, in love, you\'ve got to go for broke.
 Dying in battle.......is better than the alternative."
"They say the most torturous toxin for humans is made from rotting love.
 ......The suffering it brings......exceeds the tortures of the most twisted hells."
She said this as a warning to motivate her double and little sister,
 encouraging her to take on any trial, no matter how severe...
"............I understand."
After all, when my desire to have Battler‐san one day accept me wells up in my chest,
 .........I can feel the seed that resides there.
"......It is up to me to kill that seed or make it bud.
 ......But if I let it rot here in my chest, ......its poison will surely torment me forever..."
"And that, .........even for us thousand year old witches,
 ......is the most terrifying torture in the world..."
"Behold what happens to those who make light of love!
 This hell of Rosa\'s—"
"Is what happens to those who do not possess the courage to make the seed of love bud, and instead allow it to rot."
""One cannot end that pain by their own hands.""
.........Huh?
 .........Just now......was that a red light......?
"..................My apologies."
"......Huh...?
 .........What.........?"
Just now...
I thought...
...I saw something strange.
......I wonder if I\'m tired...
 ......It\'s probably just my imagination.
Rosa picked up her cup of cold tea.
When she did,
 ......she saw a small...
............red rose petal floating on the surface.
...
...
A
...
...
rose
...
...
...
...
...
?
".........I have heard that, in your youth,
 ......you loved to lie on that sofa."
"...................................."
It...
...wasn\'t a rose petal.
It was...
...a drop of blood...
......that had fallen from Rosa\'s eyes.
In an instant,
 ......Kanon had beautifully and precisely...
......cut just the single thread of Rosa\'s life...
There was no wound on Rosa\'s body.
There were only......the few drops of blood......that dripped down from her eyes.
Her pain, her uncertainties, and her worries......were all gone now.
Slowly, .........she collapsed onto the sofa and lay there.
That had been one of her most blissful habits during the most blissful time of her life......
"Sleep well, ......Rosa‐sama.
 ......Your hell...has ended."
Kanon took a blanket out of a cupboard...
......and gently covered Rosa with it...
It would have looked to anyone...
...just as though Rosa was sleeping peacefully......
......Those demons had not exaggerated when speaking of love as a battle and a trial.
In fact, although cruel, this could even be said to be an honest reflection of reality,
 in the sense that it made no attempt to hide the fact that to lose in love is to die...
"......Now my part is complete.
 ......Were you watching, demons?"
"......Oh......no.........!"
"How could you kill Mama?!!
 HOW COULD YOU KILL MAMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHH!!!"
One of the two great witches of Mariage Sorcière, MARIA.
Though she was just an apprentice, the power sleeping within her had impressed even BEATRICE at the height of her strength.
In MARIA\'s eyes, though Rosa was the black witch,
 ......she was also the vessel of the mother she couldn\'t help but love.
Her anger at having that stolen from her was near madness.
"How could you do that to Mama, to Mama to Mama to Mama!!
 Nngggyyyyyyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahh!!!"
MARIA\'s attack was too emotional.
Because of this, she didn\'t notice that Kanon had already disappeared in the span of a few short moments,
 ...and she released her barrage at what had become empty space.
In the meantime, Kanon jumped from wall to wall, around to MARIA\'s back...
"...............Huh...h...?"
"......I don\'t want to kill past my quota.
 ......But I will defend myself...!!"
"............Uryuu."
"Wh‐
......what are...
...you—"
"......Diplomatic immunity!
 ......I won\'t let you target MARIA or me...!"
"D‐......damn........."
The red‐trailing sword that extended from Kanon\'s hand dissipated in an instant.
He managed to make it reappear, but when he tried to use it on MARIA and Sakutarou again, it vanished once more.
Because of Sakutarou\'s power, he was unable to make either of them the target of his attacks.
"......There you are.
 ......Since when have you been there......?"
"Uryuu...
 ......I won\'t let anyone bully MARIA."
"D‐......dammit......!"
MARIA finally noticed where Kanon was, and she slowly turned around...
Kanon made his sword materialize yet again,
 but no matter how often he tried, it kept fading out, like a flashlight with a bad battery...
"I won\'t let you get away now......
 ......I won\'t forgive you.........for the sin of stealing Mama away...
 ......I\'ll kill you.
 ...Just like Mama killed them, ...I\'ll kill you without mercy!!!"
As MARIA howled, the entire parlor was surrounded by a cube of red, magic barriers.
It was a locked room symbolizing a barrier that Kanon could never escape.
"......Dammiiiiiit...!!
 Not......here......!"
Kanon cursed his bad luck.
Even though he had fulfilled his goal in the demons\' trial,
 ......if he was killed here, he\'d be dragged off of the game board...!
".........MARIA.
 ......Don\'t overdo it."
"Yeah, I won\'t overdo it.
 ......I\'ll be a little more gentle than Mama was.
 ......Kuhihihihihihihhi,
 hahahahahaahahahahaah
hahaahahahahahahyahaaaaaahaahh!!!"
"......?!?!"
"Uryu, who is it?!"
"......Pardon me, Maria‐sama...
 In accordance with the contract with Zepar‐sama and Furfur‐sama, I come for your life...!"
"Shannon, ......don\'t get...
...in my wayyyyyyyyyyyy!!"
"It\'s pointless, Shannon.
 ......No one can target MARIA...!"
"Yes.
 I don\'t intend to target her in any way.
 ......I will simply protect myself."
A cylindrical red magical barrier surrounded Shannon as she stood in the center of the parlor.
Its brightness and thickness grew, and its radius quickly expanded, filling up the room.
It wasn\'t targeting MARIA.
Shannon was wielding this power to protect herself.
So, Sakutarou\'s power didn\'t make it disappear.
".........N‐......Nee‐san......"
"Are you going to let this be the ruin of your feelings for Milady?
 ......Get ahold of yourself...!"
"Ugh, ......ghgh, gghh.........!!"
"Uryu...uu.........!!"
By now, the shield with Shannon at the center had covered up the entire room.
 Its power crushed MARIA and Sakutarou into the corner of the room.
Ironically, it was the locked‐room barrier MARIA had set up to prevent Kanon from escaping that they were pressed against, and the two together had them completely trapped.
"...No...good......
 ...Can\'t......escape......"
"......*cackle*cackle*, kuhihihihihihiihihihihhihihiihi!!
 That\'s right, this is a locked room...
 ......Kihihihihihihihihihihi!
 This might be just perfect for that wannabe detective who\'s trying to deny Beato\'s magic."
".........Checkmate, Maria‐sama.
 ......May I?"
"Yeah, go ahead!! Crush me!
 ......Kihhihhihhihhihhihhihhii!!"
"Then, goodbye...!"
The entire room was filled with the red light of the shield, ......and the output and pressure were raised to their limits.
......Then, crushed between the shield and their own locked‐room barrier,
 ......MARIA and Sakutarou lost their forms, scattered into a spray of gold, and disappeared...
"......Thank you.
 ......I couldn\'t afford to disappear here."
"If you lost in a place like this, you\'d never be able to let it go."
"......You\'re right.
 I could never let it go if I lost in a place like this."
"Zepar‐sama, Furfur‐sama.
 We have both finished our trial.
 Is that satisfactory...?"
"Well, that was truly splendid!
 A faultless performance from the both of you!"
"Then shall we finish with BEATRICE\'s turn...?
 Oh, where did she go?"
"To the victim she has chosen, of course."
""Come, let us go there as well!""
......Natsuhi could be seen in her room.
Krauss had instructed her to retire for the night,
 but she couldn\'t afford to lie around sleeping on an important day like this.
However, she was aware that she was the type to get excited easily,
 and that this sometimes held her husband back...
So,
 ......though she didn\'t like it one bit,
 ......there was no way around it...
It was probably close to the time for the break to end and the family conference to begin once again in the dining hall.
Her husband would have to protect the Ushiromiya family honor from his greedy siblings......all by himself.
If she grew emotional by his side, she would just tie him down.
...Though she knew that quietly waiting here was the best way she could support him, ........that didn\'t make the waiting any easier.
Natsuhi opened a drawer and took out the small box she kept her treasures in.
This was her secret box.
Inside was everything from valuable items to mere odds and ends.
......However, they were all precious, memorable treasures in Natsuhi\'s eyes.
She pulled a small pouch out of the box.
She emptied its contents onto her palm.
.........It was a kind of charm that her birth family had given her when she had married.
...It was a spirit mirror to ward off evil.
Her face was reflected in the mirror.
......She wasn\'t as young as she once was.
Recently, she had begun to see a bit of her parents and grandparents in her own face.
So when she stared at her reflection in the mirror like this,
 she felt as though her soul had returned to the side of her parents and the family she had been born into...
"......Father, ...Mother......
 ......I cannot support my husband......and I have only myself to blame..."
Of course, her face in the mirror did not answer...
 However, Natsuhi continued.
"......I am waiting here alone because I love my husband.
 ......However, I think love means being close to one another.
 ......Though I understand logically that staying here is the best way I can help him,
 .........I still feel wretched for doing it...
 .........It\'s tough, isn\'t it, ......waiting for the sake of love..."
A tear plopped onto the mirror.
Old, dear memories of her life at her parents\' house rose up inside her.
Now was the time......for her to follow her parents\' example...
When her father came home late, her mother would always sit up straight waiting for him, prepared for him to arrive at any moment.
......She would always wait for him, kneeling in the entrance hall,
 and no matter how late he came home, she would always wake up all her children and line them up to greet him.
At the time, I only thought of her as being exceptionally strict,
 .........but at this age, I finally understand how strong she was, persevering in her love for her beloved husband even after being left alone in charge of the house.
"Because of your love for your husband,
 ......you couldn\'t bear to be made to care for an unfamiliar child."
"......?!?!"
The sudden voice made Natsuhi jump up and look about the room.
When she did,
 ......there stood a Western lady wrapped in an extravagant dress.
"Wh‐......who are you?!"
"........................"
Natsuhi was confused.
 There was no one like this in this mansion.
However, though this was supposedly her first time meeting this person, it felt as though she had seen her somewhere before...
Her anger at the ruffian who had snuck into her private room...
...and her confusion over the appearance of someone she didn\'t know caused her mind to go blank,
 ......so much so that it took quite a bit of time before she realized that this was the witch of the portrait.
"......Though you murdered a baby you didn\'t know on that day 19 years ago, I won\'t hold that sin against you."
"Wh‐
.........what are you...
t‐
talking about......?"
Beato had chosen Natsuhi as her sacrifice.
It was because of what Natsuhi had done to "Battler".
Beato didn\'t know much about the details of Battler\'s birth.
.........However, after discovering the fragment of the previous game,
 she had learned that there was a chance that Battler was the baby that Natsuhi had pushed off a cliff 19 years ago.
Although that was just a blue wedge that Battler had used to protect Natsuhi from being framed,
 ......Beato thought it might have been a confession from Battler himself,
 and if that was the case, to her, Natsuhi was an enemy who probably forced Battler to live a painful life.
"It was out of love for your husband that you killed that baby who lacked his blood, and it\'s out of love that I won\'t hold it against you."
"I don\'t......have a clue what you\'re talking about!!
 Get out!! This is my room!!"
"Therefore,
 ......when I kill you for the sake of my love, please don\'t hold that against me either."
Beato slowly stuck out her arms......and with both hands, she squeezed the air in front of her.
......That squeeze......tightened around Natsuhi\'s throat.
"Ggh...
......ah...
......eh........."
Natsuhi\'s heels lifted off the ground, and a faint, purple hand shape appeared around her throat...
Natsuhi frantically scratched at her throat, trying to stop whatever was strangling her, but there was nothing there.
......So, to an outsider, it just looked as though Natsuhi was standing on her toes in anguish, scratching at her own throat.
".........Both pairs of lovers have shown their determination.
 ......I don\'t think...that my feelings for Battler‐san are inferior to theirs...
 ......Just as I won\'t blame you for your sin of 19 years ago, ......I won\'t blame myself for this sin...!"
".........Eh
.........gah
.........gghh..............."
As Natsuhi twisted in agony, something she had been grasping fell from her grip.
It rolled over to Beato, who dropped her gaze to see what it was...
......It was......Natsuhi\'s spirit mirror.
When Beato peered into it, .........there was a loud crack like a burst of electricity.
That sound released Natsuhi from the invisible hands...
and made Beato topple backwards like a doll.
"*cough*...*cough*cough*......?!
 ........................?!??"
Coughing, Natsuhi tried to comprehend what was going on around her.
Beato, whose head was still reeling and foggy as though she had hit it against something hard,
 slowly attempted to get to her feet.
Her eyes were bewildered, as though even she didn\'t really understand what had happened.
"......Wh‐......what...
............what is this......?"
"That is...surprising......
 You could touch spiderwebs without trouble, ......but you cannot handle the spirit mirror...?"
"E‐even I......don\'t have a clue what\'s happening...
 What in the world......"
She had thought that only Beato the Elder possessed non‐human weak points,
 such as getting burned by spiderwebs and wards and having her power sealed by spirit mirrors.
However, ......for some reason, this spirit mirror alone could apparently affect her as well.
Even she couldn\'t understand what about the spirit mirror could have such an overpowering effect on her.
"..................!!"
But Natsuhi was different.
She instantly realized that the reason for the hesitation of this unearthly being, this witch of the portrait, ......had to be the power of the mirror.
So, she rapidly crawled across the floor and picked up the mirror.
Then, she stuck it out so that Beato could see it...
......Beato still didn\'t fully understand what was happening,
 so, still sitting down, she looked vacantly at it.
And this time, both of them understood the situation completely.
Beato realized that the mirror was working some hateful power against her.
And Natsuhi realized that the spirit mirror had the power to repel witches.
"......Gghh......uuuuuhhh......!!
 Wh‐...why is...the mirror......?!"
"It is because you are an evil witch.
 .........This miraculous spirit mirror repels all creatures of evil...!"
".........Don\'t......point it at me......!"
With the spirit mirror still held out, Natsuhi cautiously closed the gap between them.
She was cautious, so as to prevent the witch from suddenly lashing out and stealing the mirror, ......but she steadily moved forward to corner this evil.
"I...I do not know who you are.
 ......All I know is that you tried to kill me,
 and that you are a creature of evil who cowers before this spirit mirror.
 ......Begone, evil one...!!"
Beato didn\'t understand what was happening herself.
......She didn\'t know why she had to fear this spirit mirror.
However, when she tried to look at the bright light let off by the spirit mirror, it pierced her eyes.
She understood that she had to be afraid, even if she didn\'t understand why.
By now, Beato realized that this spirit mirror was both terrifying and harmful.
As it came closer to her, she felt an increasingly strong burning sensation over her whole body, as though someone was approaching her with a hot iron.
 She couldn\'t even open her eyes because of the mirror\'s bright, painful glint...
"Uuuuu...
...ah...
......aaaaaaaahhh.........ah..."
"Now, return to the world whence you came, wicked one!
 I, Ushiromiya Natsuhi, will not falter back a single step to evil!"
......It\'s......no use......
......Why......?
Why is this......musty mirror...so...
If I...
...lose here,
 .........I\'ll be the only one...
......to fail this trial......
Just like...
...George‐san and Shannon‐san,
 ......and Jessica‐san and Kanon‐san,
 ......I want Battler‐san to see value in me...
...and treasure me...
I\'ve...
...finally managed to admit that,
 .........so I can\'t...
...............fail now............
"Are you giving up?!
 You, and only you?!"
"Believe!
 The miracle of love will surely occur!"
......I...
......love...
...Battler‐san...
I want him to notice me.
And I want him to recognize and accept my feelings......
My reason for calling him Father as I dedicated myself to him...
...was that no one helps a parent expecting something in return, and that helped me come to terms with getting nothing back...
It was...a deception to fool myself with......
......I......love Battler‐san.
And I want him to recognize that.
I admit it.
 I won\'t hide from it any longer.
......I was born to love Battler‐san...and to have him love me back......
"......So,
 .........I can\'t afford...
......to lose here........."
"Begone, wicked one!!
 There is no place for you here!"
"Nn, ......gwaah...!!!"
Her determination had come too late.
If she had possessed it since the beginning, ......she would probably have finished off Natsuhi on the spot without any hesitation.
Because she had wavered, it had taken time to kill Natsuhi, ......and things had ended up like this.
But now, I am resolved.
I want to love Battler‐san.
 I want him to love me.
"......So I can\'t...lose here...!
 Because I......was born for Battler‐san\'s sake...!!"
"Yes, that is exactly—"
"What we wanted to hear."
".........Ah...?!"
Following a sound like a beetle banging off all the walls in the room,
 the spirit mirror was knocked out of Natsuhi\'s outstretched hand.
It fell onto the floor,
 ......and the stake flying around the room pierced through it with a crash.
"Lucifer the Proud, right here!
 ......You dare mock me by having a single old mirror as my first target in so long?"
".........Huh?!
 Ah, ......Lucifer...san......?"
"BEATRICE‐sama, you must complete your trial...!
 She\'ll get away...!"
"S‐......someone!!
 Help me!!
 Someoooooooone!!"
Now that the spirit mirror she had been relying on had been smashed, and another strange demon had been added to the fold, Natsuhi could do nothing but run for it.
However, if Natsuhi made a scene and people gathered, the anti‐magic toxin would burn Beato.
Now was Beato\'s last chance.
"Th‐......thank you, Lucifer‐san...!
 ............P‐prepare yourself, Ushiromiya Natsuhi...!"
".........Gggah!!
 Ghghhgg...............kk......"
Once again, Beato choked the empty air.
This time, she wouldn\'t let her escape.
She had to end Natsuhi\'s pain right away, for her sake if nothing else.
 ......But......her strength......wasn\'t enough......
While scratching at her throat, Natsuhi fought to escape the room.
......Her shaking hand...stretched out......to the lock on the door.
A locked room is one of the definitions that makes a witch.
Even unlocking the door would strengthen the anti‐magic toxin a little.
Since Beato was at her limit even within the locked room, if Natsuhi undid that lock,
 ......Beato\'s power would weaken immediately, and Natsuhi would surely escape into the hallway.
Their strengths were matched.
 However, Natsuhi\'s began to surpass Beato\'s slightly...
The power of the living to live is fundamentally stronger than the power of magic.
Of course, Beato was mustering all her might.
 However, ......Natsuhi was just slightly......stronger......
".........That\'s enough.
 ......Lucifer, do it."
"A‐as you wish!"
Lucifer transformed into a stake, and, like the time she had smashed Natsuhi\'s spirit mirror, flew violently around the room.
 ......Then, she struck Natsuhi\'s forehead.
Natsuhi......crumpled slowly.
When Beato saw this, she also fell to her knees, breathing hard.
"Say, Zepar!
 Does this count?
 BEATRICE didn\'t complete the trial by her own strength alone!"
"You raise a good point, Furfur!
 True, this trial must be accomplished without borrowing the help of any other!"
"But maybe there are exceptions to that?!"
""After all, a pair in love are as one!
 This is not outside assistance!""
".........B‐......Battler‐san......"
"Did you really have to scare me like that on the first twilight?"
"F‐......forgive me...
 I didn\'t follow your instructions..."
"Instructions?"
"......Well, .........I didn\'t stay in my room......"
Beato hung her head apologetically.
......When he saw this, Battler scratched his head uncomfortably.
"In that case, ......I should apologize too.
 ......I should have been more kind."
"N‐
...no,
 ......Father,
 ......I...I mean...Battler‐san, you did nothing wrong..."
"It\'s okay. Call me whatever you like."
"Huh.........?"
Battler had always looked at the new BEATRICE sternly.
However, that was gone from his expression now...
"......True, the old you may have called me just "Battler".
 ......At first, I might have tried to force you to speak to me that way.
 ......But forcing that on you is pointless.
 You are Beato...but you\'re yourself.
 .........You can call me whatever you want."
"B‐.........Battler‐san........."
"Sure, that works great.
 ......Can\'t say being called Father is really my thing."
"...Y‐.........yes..."
Until this point, she had hesitated just to say Battler\'s name at all.
Even if she had known that Battler wanted her to say his name without honorifics, that would have been beyond her right now,
 .........and even if she had been able to call him that, doing so could have hurt Battler even more.
However, ......now, she was allowed to call Battler by his name.
If you just looked into her eyes,
 ......there would be no need to describe just how happy this made her feel...
"I heard from Zepar and Furfur.
 ......It looks like you\'re in the middle of some bizarre game."
"Y‐yes...
 I\'m sorry for doing this without asking......"
"No, it\'s fine.
 I never did know what you were going to do next—getting up to antics like this is really like you.
 ......And...well, I\'ve heard about the intent of the game.
 Apparently, you\'re supposed to tackle it as a pair."
"Yes, that is correct, Lord BATTLER!!"
"If you can emerge from our trial victorious—"
""We will bless the pair of you and bestow a miracle of magic upon you!""
"It looks like these guys were the ones giving power to Beato\'s golden butterfly brooch.
 So they\'re proven to produce results.
 .........We\'ve been stuck with each other for a long time now.
 Nothing wrong with playing this sort of game every now and then."
"......Battler‐san............"
"Oh, did you hear that, Furfur?!
 It looks like Lord BATTLER is joining in as well!!"
"That\'s no surprise!
 After all, we\'ve known since the beginning!"
""Welcome to our trial, Lord BATTLER!
 And who will your sacrifice be?!""
"......My work is already done.
 Go and check if you want."
"Very well, Lord BATTLER!
 Come, Furfur, let us go check!"
"Yes, let\'s!
 But Zepar?
 This means that all six lovers have completed their trial!
 What should we do next?!"
""The resolve of all six is the real deal!
 Let us test them further in the next trial!""
The two noisy demons disappeared.
It seemed that they had left to go check on the sacrifice Battler had killed,
 ......but it also seemed that they had done so in order not to bother Battler and Beato, who could finally look each other in the eye and talk......
"......What do you think of the tale so far......?"
When suddenly asked this question, Ange immediately came to her senses...
Then, realizing that she had become immersed in this woman\'s tale,
 she felt a bit defeated and tried to look displeased.
"Y‐......you\'ve cleverly tried to mix things up with all this about the love trial,
 but exactly six people have died, setting up the first twilight.
 Impressive."
"Oh, you\'re right.
 I didn\'t realize."
Amakusa clapped his hands as though he\'d been outsmarted.
Even though he\'d figured it out before me, he played the fool.
"......That\'s simply because the number of lovers just happened to be six.
 The fact that it matched to the number of the first twilight was half coincidence, half design.
 ......It\'s a bit more interesting that way—feels more like fate."
"Humans have the bad habit of taking two meaningless phenomena and trying to link them together.
 Trying to make things seem like fate is a "trick" of books."
"I guess you aren\'t a fan of <destiny> and <miracles>, missy."
"They\'re like UFOs.
 Everyone knows about them, but no one has ever seen them."
"There\'s a <cool> metaphor."
"......So.
 Normally, I would move right along at this point, my only comment being that love and illusions are unnecessary, useless scenes for a mystery story."
"......But Okonogi‐san disagreed with that way of thinking.
 He thought that, by looking at things without love that way, the truth could never be reached."
"Ah, you mean President Okonogi\'s killer phrase?
 Without love, it cannot be {y:1:‘seen’}{n:1:seen}?"
"Yeah, that.
 ......If I were to set aside the anger I feel towards this fictional murder of my family...
...and speak with respect for you as the one who wrote this tale, I\'d say there must be a point to this depiction.
 After all, you\'ve used up all these pages talking about love and trials.
 ......In other words, those are the themes and key words of this tale."
"......Oho.
 ......And there are many who claim that all words not written in red ink are not worth reading.
 ......It is an honor, child of man,
 that you have read the black letters as well."
"Stories are written because the writer has something they want to communicate.
 And some writers feel that it\'s unrefined to lay everything out too directly."
".........All of this about how you\'ll never reach the truth without love has shown up many times in the works before this one.
 This new work makes that even more striking.
 ......It means that that is the one thing the writer wanted to tell the most—the thing that they want the reader to think about the most."
......Thinking about it, there have been many scenes about love since Beato first appeared.
Even when she first appeared before Shannon, she spoke clearly about how love was the single element of the world.
And the golden butterfly brooch she gave her......was also an item for love.
She said that she enjoyed sowing seeds of love and watching complications arise,
 and when Shannon stopped borrowing her power, the reason for her argument was also love.
......After Beato\'s interactions with Battler started up in full, scenes about love were toned down for a while,
 ......but the "without love, it cannot be {y:1:‘seen’}{n:1:seen}" definition of magic was mentioned repeatedly.
Then, in the tale right before this one, where Beato had become like a doll,
 the scenes shown made it seem almost as though Battler and Beato accepted each other as adversaries......or possibly something more.
In the end, Battler regained some kind of memory, and his impression of Beato underwent a complete change.
......And then there\'s this game.
From the beginning and throughout, the word "love" has been repeated over and over again.
"The tale you wrote keeps talking about love.
 However, that\'s not the assertion of Maria onee‐chan or BEATRICE.
 ......It\'s the assertion of Hachijo Tohya."
"......Correct.
 That is what I wanted to tell.
 And it is my own sort of "answer"."
"Answer?
 ......You\'re saying the entire incident of twelve years ago was caused by a trial of love started by strange demons?"
"Ridiculous.
 I didn\'t come here to read a romance novel you wrote.
 ......What I want to know about is the truth you claim to have reached."
"......Foolish child of man.
 ...I have exhausted so many words, and yet you still do not understand?"
With an obviously condescending gaze, Hachijo shrugged.
It was clear that she was trying to provoke Ange.
She was probably hinting, "If you can\'t stand talking with me, you can get out."
 Perhaps even, "If you\'re going to read my noble work and fail to understand it—what\'s more, not even try—
you can get out for that reason as well."
.........Under normal circumstances, Ange would already have thrown a fit and left.
However, ......Ange couldn\'t do that.
Though she found it sickening that a stranger was playing around with her family\'s fates in these stories,
 ......after reading this far through her tale, she was growing increasingly certain of something else.
......Just as Hachijo\'s followers said,
 ......this tale really did......have the same presence, the same scent, as the tales written by BEATRICE.
The author was certainly different.
However, the tale had the same scent......because its author had arrived at the real truth...
Ange was beginning to acknowledge this.
......Hachijo Tohya......was one who had reached BEATRICE\'s truth,
 .........an "Endless Witch" like BEATRICE, who could add to the endlessly stretching parallel worlds of the cat box...
"......If one has reached BEATRICE\'s truth,
 ......they can create a new tale, whoever they are.
 ......With this new manuscript, I\'m sure some other than myself will appear and reach the truth.
 .........Those people will be qualified to create new tales of their own."
"So there will be more and more Endless Witches..."
"Yes.
 And these many Endless Witches will add to BEATRICE\'s cat box tale.
 ......The more they add to it, the more people will reach the truth..."
"......When that happens, the very first Endless Witch, BEATRICE, will finally be rewarded for writing such long letters, packing them in bottles, and throwing them into the sea..."
"................................."
"......You could have yelled at me angrily and risen from your seat.
 However, you did not.
 .........Why?"
"I hate to admit it,
 ......but I\'m starting to think that your tale has some kind of truth or hint within it."
I already have my own ideas.
However, that\'s no more than looking with a single eye.
Unless I accept a different viewpoint from my own and look at things from more than one angle, I\'ll never be able to see the truth in three dimensions.
That\'s my interpretation of "without love, it cannot be {y:1:‘seen’}{n:1:seen}".
"That is as it should be, child of man.
 ......Perhaps, as the last surviving member of the Ushiromiya family,
 it was fated that you would find the truth and become an Endless Witch.
 ......I exist only as a guidepost to awaken you as the true successor.
 ......ANGE BEATRICE."
Sometimes, I have no idea what she\'s saying......
But I\'m positive she knows something.
And maybe......she actually has reached the truth, as she claims...
......To summarize, I couldn\'t understand the truth from just the two message bottles BEATRICE left behind,
 ......and since then, I\'ve been reading tale after tale of hints.
"Then......these "hints" are challenges, provoking me to think."
".........Precisely."
"Perfect.
 ......I\'ll find this truth you say you\'ve reached.
 ......I was meant to visit this place after all."
"You were indeed.
 ......It is because you are yet to arrive there that I invited you here, child of man......"
Let the truth I {y:1:‘see’}{n:1:see} and the truth you {y:1:‘see’}{n:1:see} overlap.
Just as you see things with a single eye, so do I.
And now that I\'ve found you, for the first time, I too will be able to {y:1:‘see’}{n:1:see} the truth with both eyes...
"Fwaaah......aaaahhh...
 So, the first twilight has fiiinally happened.
 Everything so far\'s made me so sleepy."
"......You have some sleep in your eye."
"Huh? Wh‐where...
 ......Th‐that was immature."
"......Hmph.
 As you wish, let\'s get started.
 ......We\'ll begin with the first twilight."
