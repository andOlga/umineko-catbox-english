"......Certainly, the body cannot last with nothing more than a small breakfast, but..."
"Of course, we understand.
 But the thing is, as time passes, it\'ll get darker and darker.
 Now is probably the lightest.
 Now is the most convenient time."
"Only about an hour has passed since Rosa-san was attacked.
 This is simply too reckless...!"
It was only natural that Natsuhi was yelling about recklessness.
...Because Rudolf had said that he was going to the mansion to get food.
Certainly, they were being tormented by hunger as well as their fatigue.
In the beginning, they were just fine, because they could fight their moderate hunger with their drowsiness;
 but now it just made their minds hazy, and even though it was still only midday, their bodies felt like they were reaching their limits.
The thought of going to the kitchen in the mansion and bringing back some food certainly was attractive.
"I am opposed to this.
 It may be a little tough, but we definitely shouldn\'t leave this place."
"......It is alright for us.
 But it would pain my heart to keep the children hungry...
 I must bear my responsibility as a parent."
"D-dear...!
 Now that Father has passed away, you are the Ushiromiya family head.
 It is not permissible for you to take on such a danger...!"
".........Yes.
 It\'s like Natsuhi-san says.
 Krauss-san, you should remain here as the leader."
"......Then, who will go to the mansion?"
"I think Kyrie and I, and Hideyoshi nii-san as well, should go.
 Hideyoshi nii-san and I are holding guns.
 They shouldn\'t be able to lay a hand on us that easily."
"Rosa-san was also holding a gun, but she was attacked.
 ...Isn\'t it dangerous?"
"...When I went out to check on Rosa and Maria-chan, I was alone, although I had a gun with me.
 But I wasn\'t attacked.
 ......Maybe they\'ll be cautious if their opponent is a man."
"Two men.
 And even two guns.
 Those two will act as guards, and I\'ll push the cart with the things.
 I believe the situation clearly differs from Rosa-san\'s."
"If you\'re countin\' me as a man, I\'d be pleased to help.
 I don\'t look it, but I trained this body pullin\' stalls.
 Leave the heavy liftin\' to me!"
"You men just need to devote yourselves to guarding.
 There\'s a folding cart in the servant room, so using that, I should be able to handle carrying the food alone."
"......Of course, we will be careful.
 And if we can succeed in this venture just once,
 we\'ll never again need to take the risk of leaving this place."
"............Is there any way I can get you to reconsider?
 It may be painful for everyone to deal with an empty stomach, ...but even so, we do not know what could happen outside now..."
"We\'ll take care.
 ......And Eva\'s feelin\' pretty darn bad right now.
 I can\'t let her stay hungry.
 If her stomach\'s empty, she can\'t even take her medicine.
 I\'ve gotta go out for Eva\'s sake as well."
"How is Eva?"
"She\'s finally gotten to sleep.
 ...She\'s burnin\' up, too.
 We should leave her be for a while..."
"......I guess you can\'t just stand still when it comes to your wife\'s health...
 .........Understood.
 I\'ll give you permission to go outside."
"Then, we\'ll take a little trip there and back.
 A speed contest.
 Canned food is OK, right?
 You at least have a can opener here, right?"
"Y-yes.
 We have a can opener and a bottle opener..."
"There\'s running water in the guesthouse, so we won\'t need anything to drink.
 There\'s ten people to cover for, so you\'ll have to take what you get."
"Alright!
 Let\'s dash out there and bring it all back pronto.
 There\'s no time to open umbrellas...!"
"So, Aniki.
 Watch the place for me."
"......Be careful.
 ...Under normal circumstances, I would want to go too.
 ...Being a man, I despise this title of eldest brother that prevents me from lending a hand in an emergency like this."
"This is about the only time we get to show off.
 Sit back and take it easy every once in a while, Aniki.
 Alright, Natsuhi-san.
 Wait here and get some towels ready or something.
 We aren\'t using umbrellas, so we\'ll be coming back like drowned rats."
"U-understood.
 ...Take care."
Rudolf, Kyrie, and Hideyoshi,
 each leaving their own brave words behind, left the lobby...
Compared to the time Rosa and Maria had gone outside, the winds had picked up once again.
Rudolf\'s group of three people jogged through the rose garden without umbrellas, holding their guns and a folded cart.
If everything had been still and quiet, without the wind and the rain, they would probably have kept their ears open and moved with caution.
But in this rain, even if some suspicious person was hiding nearby, it would be difficult to notice them.
Because of that, it had been Rudolf\'s plan to instead dash through the dangerous area.
......If there was a chance that their opponent was equipped with a gun,
 then walking slowly with their guard up would only make them a target.
It was probably correct to decide on swift action.
".........The rose garden.
 It feels like we\'re just askin\' to be attacked...!"
"Please, let nobody come out of there..."
Even as Rudolf and Hideyoshi continued to run, they looked around restlessly, vigilant of their surroundings.
Rosa and Maria\'s deaths had not been caused by a projectile.
......However, it was easy to suspect that the servants had been killed in such a manner.
Will they come flying out of the dark?
Or will they take careful aim and snipe from the shadows?
......Either way, they couldn\'t relax their tension for even an instant.
But even so, when they reached the overhang in front of the entrance to the mansion and escaped the reach of the raindrops,
 they felt themselves breathing a sigh of relief.
"No problems for the first part.
 ......It\'s not like how it was for Rosa-san.
 Maybe they can\'t get their hands on us easily."
"I\'d like to believe that.
 Kyrie, unlock the door while we keep a lookout."
"Sure.
 Returning home to the mansion with a pair of bodyguards makes me feel just like an executive."
"Wahahahaha.
 If we had a welcoming party of servants on a red carpet, it\'d be perfect."
"A welcoming party, huh.
 ...Careful what you wish for.
 Stay alert."
As the two cautiously surveyed their surroundings,
 Kyrie unlocked the front door with the master key she had been given.
"It\'s open."
"Hideyoshi nii-san.
 Could you take the front?
 I\'ll keep an eye on the rear."
"Roger.
 Kyrie-san, try not to move from my shadow.
 ......Alright, let\'s break in!"
"Rear guard, understood. Covering...!"
"......Men.
 You\'re enjoying this situation a little bit, aren\'t you?"
"Give it up, that\'s how men are.
 ......But man, there\'s still that rank stench."
...The air in the mansion felt stagnant with a heavy silence.
And worse, it was still thick with the stench from Kinzo\'s burnt corpse in the boiler room,
 and they were struck with a strong desire to leave the mansion - although they were never planning to stay.
"No problems in the front.
 Just a short dash to the kitchen."
"Let\'s finish this quickly and head home.
 This suit\'ll get fumigated with Dad\'s stench."
The three of them dashed towards the kitchen...
And after they disappeared from the entrance hall, ......the new witch showed herself there.
"They were lured out just as planned.
 ......They got caught right in my trap."
The witch grinned.
......Thinking about it now, no matter how unbearable their hunger had grown,
 barely a few hours had passed since Rosa and Maria had been attacked and had lost their lives.
In that case, why had they needed to recklessly leave the guesthouse...?
Until that question could be dealt with, the only answer was that they had been called out by the witch\'s magic...
"What reckless people.
 ......They will never leave this mansion alive.
 Lock yourself, locks! Close yourself, mansion!"
The instant she proclaimed that...
...the mansion was sealed off in a separate world.
......Unless she were to dispel the barrier, no longer could anyone exit this mansion, or enter it.
"......Spectacular.
 To think that even though barely half a day has passed since you succeeded the Endless Witch, you can use magic this well.
 ......That talent surprises me.
 It is almost as though you were born a witch."
"Well, I have been a witch since the time I was born.
 ......Who taught you how to blink?
 That\'s what using magic is like for me."
".....................
 ...A fearsome person."
The witch\'s face twisted with brutality.
......She was beside herself with excitement at being able to toy with lives again.
"Well then.
 ......Gehehehehhihhihihihihihihyahya!
 First is Rudolf and Kyrie, but what cruel way should I kill them...?!"
"......If you would excuse me,
 but the Predecessor has left instructions that you are to restrain yourself from committing murders of unnecessary cruelty.
 And, there is a protocol to follow for the sacrifices from the fourth twilight onwards.
 For that, you must borrow the power of the Seven Sisters of Purgatory."
"......Oh, really?
 Now that you mention it, that\'s right.
 I\'m only allowed to play as I like until the second twilight I just finished.
 ..................Boring.
 Just when I thought I could play to my heart\'s content like I did with Rosa.
 ......But, that refers to the way they\'re killed in the end, right?"
"By which you mean..."
"So I can just kill them however I want over and over again, revive them,
 and follow the epitaph the last time I kill them, right?"
"......So, in the end, no matter how I play, it isn\'t a problem.
 ......Who\'d act well-behaved with an interesting power like this...?!
 Kuhhihihihihihihi!"
Her wild logic was, for an Endless Witch, an extremely valid argument.
The sacrifices for the fourth twilight and onward had prescribed protocols for the method of killing, represented by things like "gouge the head".
However, that referred to the way they died in the end.
In other words, ......in the process leading up to that, she was free to tease and kill them however she wanted.
She just had to keep on reviving them, and follow the rules only when she killed them the final time.
Even while Ronove glimpsed some talent as a witch in her innocent cruelty,
 he was beginning to notice a naturally brutal side of her.
"......They do say that apprentices are the most brutal of witches, and now I see that may be true."
".........Do as you wish, ...is what I would like to say,
 but I must insist that it would be wiser to exercise some restraint in this instance.
 They are holding guns.
 Weapons with a high anti-magic power, such as guns, are the natural enemies of witches and demons."
The witch stared blankly at this demon butler, who was unexpectedly afraid of guns.
".........No one told me this.
 Shouldn\'t a witch be able to take a bullet like it\'s nothing?"
"No.
 It would be a fatal wound, exactly the same as it would for a normal Human.
 ...To prevent that weak point from being noticed,
 most witches rigorously strengthen their guard with a defense of protective barriers and furniture."
"Do I have any of those protective barrier things?"
"......Constructing a barrier to make even gun bullets ineffective requires much in preparation and rituals.
 I am afraid to say that you currently have none of those, BEATRICE-sama.
 Furthermore, you are currently ill-prepared to summon furniture strong enough to block a bullet."
"So even though I\'ve become a Great Witch with this much magical power, I really do have to be afraid of lead bullets.
 .........Annoying, but I\'ll just have to accept it.
 So, in that case, should I call some furniture to act as my arms and legs?"
"Yes.
 Leaving everything to your servants while not exposing yourself to danger is also part of a witch\'s elegant temperance.
 BEATRICE-sama, leave this to the furniture and hide in a safe place."
"...............Fine."
"...Seven Sisters of Purgatory.
 I don\'t care who, any two of you...!"
Leviathan and Belphegor responded to that call.
"Leviathan the Envious, right here."
"Belphegor the Slothful, right here."
"Show me your power.
 Your targets are Rudolf and Kyrie.
 Not Hideyoshi.
 ......Now, show me just how cruel you can be, furniture."
"......My apologies,
 but we have received an order from the Predecessor to restrain ourselves from unnecessarily cruel actions."
"Buuut, I think the Predecessor\'s order does give us some leeway to tease them.
 Will that be acceptable?"
"Hmph.
 Fine, I\'ll compromise."
"......You mustn\'t kill them easily.
 Thoroughly corner them and let them taste the fear of death before killing them.
 ......Will that be alright, Ronove?"
"Yes. If you simply remain conscious of the extent, I do not believe there will be a problem."
"...............Then, go!"
""Yes, leave it to us...!""
"Your opponents are armed with guns.
 ...For those as skilled as yourselves, dodging them should be easy,
 ...but if you are hit, it will be fatal.
 Go with an appropriate level of caution."
"Do not worry.
 We won\'t expose such a level of incompetence."
The two Sisters of Purgatory vanished.
After bowing, Ronove also disappeared.
".........There\'s even rules on how to kill them.
 .........Why do I have to be constrained by my predecessor?
 ............It\'s so rigid and boring."
As the witch looked up at the portrait of the Predecessor BEATRICE hanging in the hall, she cursed...
The three had already arrived at the kitchen, and were gathering food supplies.
Thinking of the possibility that poison had been mixed in, they gave up on the alluring fruits and vegetables,
 and gathered a whole cardboard box full of only the safe canned foods.
It was very heavy, but by piling it on the cart, they could carry it well enough.
With all of that, there would be plenty for ten people to hold out until tomorrow\'s breakfast.
 That would be enough while they waited for the boat.
The two men were supposed to be devoted to guard duty, but the weight of the load was tough on Kyrie even with the cart.
Hideyoshi, who professed himself strong, switched to being the cart-pusher, and Rudolf and his wife took up the task of guard duty.
"With all this, even George and the kids will be full.
 We\'re not safe until we\'re home, let\'s go...!"
When Hideyoshi vigorously proclaimed their departure, Kyrie frowned, looking as though she was gazing into the distance.
......There was a wall in that direction.
 ...No, if her gaze could go through that, the hall was beyond it...
".........What is it, Kyrie?"
"...I sense something.
 .........I have a bad feeling about this."
Kyrie stopped, narrowing her eyes even further.
".........Women\'s intuition?"
In times like this, Kyrie\'s intuition surpassed reason.
...Rudolf trusted that intuition.
"Yes.
 Someone\'s probably waiting to ambush us.
 ......I didn\'t sense them until a short while ago.
 ...But just now, I felt it.
 ......Just now, someone...
set up an ambush for us."
"......Then, there\'s no reason we need to return the way we came.
 There\'s a back door over there, right?
 Let\'s leave that way."
Rudolf made to unlock the back door.
When things were carried into the kitchen, they never passed through the part of the mansion that the family came and went from.
So outside the back door, there was probably a slope for transporting things.
 Surely, they would be able to leave through there with the cart.
"......What is this?
 ...It\'s stuck.
 ...Damn, what\'s going on?"
"Can\'t you open it?"
"Nope.
 Is it broken?
 It isn\'t giving an inch..."
Rudolf tried various things, using force, then coaxing it,
 but the lock was as hard as stone, and didn\'t even budge.
"...Don\'t stress over it, let\'s leave through the front entrance.
 Right now, it\'ll be even worse if we stand around wastin\' time."
".............................."
"......Are you saying this is a trap?"
"...I don\'t know.
 Be careful."
With strained expressions, the three of them returned to the hall again, and headed for the entrance...
"Wh-......who\'s there?!!"
The instant they exited into the hall, Rudolf noticed a suspicious shadow right in front of them and yelled...
In that instant, a storm of gold leaf started blowing, and gold butterflies dyed the area a golden color.
"............I can\'t believe it.
 A lowly Human predicted our ambush?"
"I-it isn\'t my fault.
 I was hiding my presence...!"
"Don\'t hesitate!! FIRE!!!"
The two guns spouted fire.
The lead bullets blasted right through the pair\'s magic defense as easily as though it were a wet paper wall,
 ......but the two who should have been there had disappeared.
Certainly, guns were very frightening objects for them.
...But there was no need to fear as long as they weren\'t hit.
They at least had enough speed to dodge those.
"Wait a sec!
 You won\'t even let us say our names?!
 This is why I hate Humans!"
Leviathan protested, popping her head out from behind a pillar in the shadow of the staircase, a full ten meters from where she had supposedly been.
"By order of BEATRICE-sama, we shall now slay you!
 We are ordered to take some time teasing you.
 You are free to resist, but know that it is useless...!"
That voice came from overhead.
Belphegor could be seen on top of the hall chandelier.
Elegantly looking down upon them, she proclaimed their execution with a cruel smile.
"......Wh-
......who the heck are these girls...?!"
"Forget the cart!!
 We have two opponents, so if we split up, they can\'t chase all of us!"
All three of them were well acquainted with the inside of the mansion.
They had already made plans to run off in separate directions in the case of a crisis, returning to the guesthouse by breaking windows or leaving through a back door.
Fighting was forbidden.
 ......As long as they could get away.
"Hah-hah-ha, of the thirty-six stratagems, fleeing is best...!!"
The three of them escaped into the depths of the mansion at full tilt.
The two furniture calmly watched them go.
"......I\'ll kill the woman.
 You take the man!"
"Understood."
The two pieces of furniture in the shadow of the pillar and on the chandelier burst apart their humanlike forms,
 and, leaving behind only the sound of hopping beetles colliding with the walls, they pursued their respective targets.
Their speed was overwhelming, and they easily blocked the others\' path of retreat.
"............I\'ll inspect their skill as furniture.
 It\'d be nice if they entertained me."
"BEATRICE-sama, I might suggest it wise not to show yourself carelessly..."
"A king doesn\'t carelessly wander about the center.
 That\'s part of a king\'s - 
a witch\'s dignity!"
In front of Rudolf, who had boldly tried to escape to the second floor, Belphegor was already standing in the way.
"It\'s useless to try and resist or escape.
 ......You don\'t need to think about anything.
 Just close your eyes.
 I\'ll bring everything to a gentle finish."
"You\'d make a good wife.
 Your husband would be pleased to hear that kind of thing when he comes home tired."
"To think that you\'re still relaxed enough to speak such vulgarity at a time like this...!"
"BEATRICE-sama, thank you for such good prey!
 Die!!!"
Rudolf fired first.
But even before that bullet could hit her, Belphegor had already moved behind Rudolf\'s back.
There she stood, her arm raised above her, a purple trail extending from it...
However, even before that arm could decapitate Rudolf, unbelievably, Rudolf had swung his gun behind him.
The barrel pointed behind his back, from the same motion with which he had reloaded the sawed-off gun one-handedly.
It was pointing right at Belphegor\'s chest...
Takk, clunk-rrrr...!
 It was the sound of the ejected empty cartridge finally hitting the wall after the reload.
In other words, it meant that the next shot was already fully loaded.
Without turning around, his gun pointing right at Belphegor\'s chest, Rudolf grinned.
".........Not bad.........
 ...For a middle-aged man...!!"
"Don\'t look down on the generation that loves westerns, got it?
 Brats don\'t know jack squat about the refinement of a lever-action."
Just like Rudolf, Kyrie was also confronting a demon stake, in the first floor corridor.
"What an idiot you are.
 You should have just escaped with your husband.
 You do know that that was your final farewell just now, right...?
 *giggle*giggle*giggle*!"
"Don\'t worry.
 This kind of thing is my husband\'s specialty.
 I\'m sure he\'ll come for me on a white horse soon."
"Because he\'s never failed to come and save me when I\'m in trouble.
 ......Not even when Asumu-san was around, you see?
 Heheh."
"Heheheheheheheh!
 What a happy couple.
 I envy you.
 .........I am Leviathan the Envious...!
 Envy is itself my power.
 My anger, my origin!"
"I agree.
 Envy is the source of a woman\'s power.
 ...And if you call something like that power, I won\'t lose to a girl like you."
"Hahhahahahahahahahaha!
 Imagine saying that to the one who governs envy!
 You actually think I\'d let you two be reunited...?!!"
"Ahhahahahaha, I\'ll give you a tragic farewell!!"
The arm Leviathan swung trailed purple.
It was a magic blade that cut by the power of malice.
Kyrie guarded herself against that with her gun.
......Even though the magic blade should have been able to cut through metal like butter, the gun, with its extremely high magic resistance,
 was able to block the blade as easily as if it were a rolled up newspaper.
Rapidly, two times, three times.
 It blocked all of them.
And, without missing the opening created when that purple trail took a long swing upward,
 Kyrie kicked Leviathan in the stomach with her heel.
Almost like she was a lightly dancing feather, Leviathan was knocked away.
...Before the demon stake\'s feet touched ground again...
Kyrie had already perfectly captured Leviathan, who was in midair, down the barrel of her gun.
From midair, the two women who had spoken to each other of envy as power met each other\'s gaze.
"......C-can you pull it?
 That trigger...!!"
"You know, I can be pretty brutal when my husband isn\'t around."
"Whoawhoaoaoaoao!!"
Rudolf tumbled down the staircase.
 He had been gradually chased down by Belphegor, and had been pushed back into the original hall.
".........The Predecessor\'s furniture is pretty good.
 She\'s lacking in flair, though!"
"BEATRICE-sama...!
 It isn\'t over yet, it\'s dangerous to show yourself...!"
"........................Could you...
...possibly be...Aneki?"
"That used to be my name.
 But not now, Rudolf."
"You don\'t have to tell me.
 You\'re going to say you\'re the Golden Witch, BEATRICE, right?"
"Ehheheheheh, ahhahahahaha!
 How did you know?"
"......Since the time Rosa was killed, I had a general idea."
".........Rosa, forgive me.
 Forgive me for sending the sister you hated down to your hell...!!"
"BEATRICE-sama, look out!!!"
Rudolf pointed the unforgiving barrel of his gun at the witch who claimed to have once been his sister.
But Belphegor could not permit that, and savagely attacked.
She sprung at him, vanished, and got behind him.
If he dodged that attack, she got behind him again.
She vanished over and over, each time teleporting into Rudolf\'s blind spot.
It was almost like she was a fairy.
 As she blinked in and out of vision, Belphegor incessantly drove towards Rudolf.
"This might be kinda fun in its own way.
 Rudolf, let me leisurely watch and see how long your brave efforts last you.
 *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!"
Then, a dull tearing sound and Rudolf\'s cry of anguish intermingled.
Rudolf had finally reacted too slowly in his dance with the purple trail which pressed upon him,
 and he had let it lightly cut him on his side.
A single wound delayed a single one of his actions.
That caused a new wound, which delayed him from acting again.
Belphegor\'s dance began to swallow Rudolf whole...
Watching Rudolf\'s body gradually get carved up, his former sister let out a shrill laugh.
Leviathan could no longer hide her irritation that Kyrie was absolutely refusing to allow her to deliver a fatal wound.
".........I really am dense.
 ...Among the Seven Sisters, I was always the slowest to grow.
 I was always slow, always weak, always stupid."
"......That inferiority complex became envy,
 and when I converted that into power, I gained a strength greater than that of any of the other sisters."
"It\'s important to have a moderate inferiority complex when you\'re a girl.
 It teaches women about cosmetics and hard work."
"I don\'t like using the limits of my power against mere Humans.
 ......But I will turn my envy of your ability to completely trust your husband into power."
"......I don\'t like it.
 Why are you so relaxed when you\'re fighting for your life?"
"......*giggle*.
 I wonder?"
"............I get it.
 You fully believe that your husband will definitely come to rescue you and will save you.
 .........Isn\'t it incredible, that trust of yours.
 It\'s worthy of my envy."
What kind of trust do we sisters have in each other?
We sisters are always looking down on each other, trying to thoroughly lambast each other and turn things from bad to worse...!
"I\'ve always been bullied by my sisters.
 I\'ve always wanted just one of them to become my ally."
"......So since you have that single ally,
 who you can place complete trust in, I feel the strongest envy towards you..."
"............Aaah, that composed expression of total belief in your husband...!
 I can feel my envy giving me power...!!
 .........I might even exceed it.
 The speed of sound!!!"
Leviathan turned herself into a stake, and the speed of her flight as she attacked was proportional to the strength of her envy.
"On that day when my sisters looked down on me,
 I was jealous from the bottom of my heart of the other six, who had grown quickly!
 I was jealous for seven days and seven nights!!
 Behold the power and speed I ultimately gained...!!
 Die, Ushiromiya Kyrieeeeeeeeeeee!!!"
The demon stake exposed her true form, leaping about at a terrible speed.
 The noise from her colliding with and bouncing off the walls sounded like a machine gun.
By now, Kyrie probably couldn\'t tell whether it was a single stake or a swarm of beetles flying and bouncing around.
Leviathan was certain of a greater than 100% chance of victory, from the bottom of her heart...!
Then, Kyrie spoke with an unbelievably calm voice.
".........I was the one who had been going out with Rudolf-san from the very beginning.
 ......Asumu-san shamelessly cut in between us,
 ...and calculatingly got herself pregnant."
"......I don\'t blame Rudolf-san.
 That woman manipulated him using her body as a weapon,
 and cornered him into a situation where he was forced to become engaged to her."
Asumu-san was carrying Battler-kun.
And at the same time, I was also carrying a boy.
...As fate would have it, our delivery dates were on the same day.
"And Asumu-san gave birth to Battler-kun.
 ...But I was not so lucky.
 .........There\'s something I\'ve thought about.
 What if Asumu-san had been the unlucky one, and I had been the one to give birth?"
"......Would Rudolf-san have broken off his engagement and married me?
 ......But I couldn\'t birth a child.
 So until Asumu-san died,
 and until I got pregnant with Ange, I cursed Asumu-san, and was jealous of her."
Asumu-san should just die.
And then I want him to remarry, with me... In my envy, I kept cursing her like that, over and over, until Asumu-san finally died.
I became certain.
I became certain that I possessed the power of magic, and that it had become a curse which had killed Asumu-san.
But that did not quell the flames of my envy.
Don\'t tell anyone, alright?
Every time I look at Battler-kun, I remember that woman.
And every time I look at Battler-kun,
 ...I think that if only my child had been born, he would be the same age.
I am still jealous of her, tormented by her.
Now, and forever.
 For all eternity.
"You say that you were jealous of your sisters for seven days and seven nights...?"
"Th-......that\'s right..."
Don\'t make me laugh, you little brat.
".........How could you understand the madness of a woman...
whose man was stolen from her, and who has burned with envy for eighteen years...!!"
"U-......uoawaaaaaAAaaaaAAAAHHH!!!!"
If Leviathan\'s power had 24 hours * 7 days, or 168 hours\' worth of speed...
Then the power that Kyrie had accumulated...
was 24 hours in 1 day,
 365 days in 1 year,
 and for 18 whole years......
Even without counting leap years,
 it was 157,680 hours.
...Compared to Leviathan\'s power and speed,
 it was more than 938 times greater.
So then, even if Leviathan was soaring at the speed of sound, 1,225 km/h,
 ......to Kyrie\'s eyes, it only looked like...
1/938 of that.
So then, so then, 1225/938 is...
.........a speed of...
1.30 km/h.
...They say that a human\'s walking speed is 4 km/h, so it was even less than half of that.
 Almost the same speed as a baby crawling on the floor.
So then, so then, so then...!
In unit time slowed so much you could count all the bits of dust floating through the air,
 Kyrie looked at the demon stake with pity.
She pitied the slowness at which it came towards her.
And she lazily raised the barrel of her gun.
Almost as though she was trying to swallow the demon stake up with the gun barrel.
"You\'re completely lacking in both love and envy."
"......Come back when you\'re older, darling."
"Rudolf, what happened to all that vigor from a couple seconds ago?
 Ikezukuri is best served while it\'s still twitching.
 After it dies, it isn\'t interesting in the slightest.
 That\'s enough.
 Why not kill him now and forever?!"
".........kh, ......damn it......"
"I\'m surprised you managed to endure this long after being carved up."
"......That\'s enough.
 You don\'t need to think about anything more.
 I\'ll steal your life away painlessly...!"
"Wait... Do me a favor.
 In the very end, I want to do one of those..."
"......What do you mean, one of those?"
"One of those things that westerns made famous.
 That thing where we put our backs together, walk three steps, and then bang."
"............Ah, a duel.
 Very well.
 If that will satisfy your regrets in this world, I\'ll accept."
Rudolf raised his wound-covered body, and turned his back to her.
Belphegor responded, and faced her back to his.
...Belphegor had a sense of integrity that was uncommon in a witch\'s furniture.
"Let me warn you.
 Even if you press the barrel of your gun between my eyebrows,
 I can teleport even faster than you could pull the trigger and have the bullet reach my skull."
"......Yeah, I\'m already feeling that throughout my body.
 ...You are faster than a bullet."
"I have agreed to this out of respect for your courage in challenging me to a duel despite that knowledge.
 Thank me."
"......You are a person of integrity.
 And a good woman.
 You might just steal my heart away."
"Let\'s get this started.
 Three steps is fine?"
".........First, one step."
"......Two steps."
"......Three steps.
 Is that alright?"
"Yep.
 ......And, since you still haven\'t noticed after walking three whole steps,
 ......looks like I win, girl."
"Whaaat......?"
"...........................Ah...h...!"
Rudolf turned around and fired off a bullet.
......Of course, Belphegor could easily see through the speed and trajectory of a bullet like that.
It should have been no problem at all to dodge it.
But a spray of fresh blood flew about.
......Belphegor had set up an adequate magical defensive barrier.
But before an incarnation of anti-magic power such as that bullet, it was completely meaningless.
".........What are you doing?
 Why\'d you get hit...?!"
The bullet had hit Belphegor right in the chest.
 ...The pain from the lead caused her to grimace, as did as the pain from the denial of magic...
"......Forgive me.
 I\'m a coward of a man."
"..................ku-
...............u..."
"Wh-...What a mood-killer.
 To think that someone who is furniture to a witch could be defeated by a Human...!"
"Know your shame.
 Worthless, pathetic...!
 Why don\'t you just stay sprawled there and die forever?!"
".........Quit it, Aneki.
 ...This girl could have dodged it.
 But she didn\'t."
"......She realized that you were in the line of fire.
 So this girl of integrity took it without dodging, and guarded you.
 In the very end, she noticed that I was forking the rook and the king."
"Spe-.........spectacular............"
"Don\'t think badly of me.
 ...I\'d planned to accept my fate if you realized while you were taking those three steps."
"............Those three steps...
were out of...
consideration for me, then...
 .........I didn\'t even try to think about it.
 ......I...
...was la...
zy........."
"......You were a good woman.
 Go to heaven before me and do your makeup.
 I\'ll definitely come and talk you up."
As Belphegor slowly fell over, ...she lost even the power that kept her in a human form,
 and she turned as fine as gold dust, and melted into thin air...
At that point, Kyrie dashed in.
It seemed that she had defeated her pursuer with her own hands.
As she pointed the barrel of her gun straight at the witch, she ran up to the wound-covered Rudolf.
"......Are you alright?
 Were you talking someone up just now?"
"Yep, a fine woman.
 ...No match for you, of course."
"............Sorry, Aneki.
 It\'s checkmate."
The two of them pinned the witch down the barrels of their guns.
"............Worthless furniture.
 ...I can\'t believe they were beaten by Human opponents.
 ...Worthless.
 Stupid.
 ...Boring...!"
"BEATRICE-sama, we should retreat from this place.
 ......There is no furniture or barrier to guard against bullets here."
"Eheheheh,
 ......*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!"
The witch began to let out a muffled laugh.
...It surprised not only Rudolf and Kyrie, but Ronove as well.
.........Because a situation like this, with two guns pointed at her,
 was not one that could just be laughed off, even by a witch.
But the witch laughed with pleasure.
".........Well, it\'s only natural that it\'d be impossible for the Predecessor\'s worn out furniture.
 ......I have to have new furniture, suitable for me.
 I used them out of obligation,
 ......but I\'ve always hated hand-me-downs."
As she said that, she looked down at Belphegor\'s remains, which had turned completely into a pile of gold dust, with disgust.
"I don\'t know what you\'re talking about.
 Now put your damn hands up."
...Then, the witch obediently raised her hands.
But instead of raising her hands because a gun was being pointed at her,
 it looked more like she was a conductor facing an orchestra, waving her conductor\'s baton.
"Come, arise, furniture suitable for me...!!
 Not that cheap furniture, much much stronger ones!
 Cruel ones!!
 Ahhahahahahahahahahahahyahhyahhya!!!"
"No funny stuff...!
 I\'ll pull the trigger...!"
In response to the witch\'s call, the hall was once again buried in the color of gold.
It was a wild dance of brilliantly radiant gold butterflies,
 ...and felt as though they had been swallowed up by an ocean of gold leaf.
Ronove was left shocked at that upsurge in magic power...
That was because it far surpassed even that of his former master.
As their eyes were dazzled amidst the golden brilliance, a gunshot could be heard.
Either Rudolf or Kyrie had fired a round.
......And after the golden glow had subsided, there was the witch, looking at least cool and composed.
The bullet?
 Kyrie had definitely fired it into her.
But it was not embedded anywhere in the witch\'s body.
There it was.
 ...The bullet was fastened in midair right in front of the witch\'s chest.
"A, ......a bullet-proof barrier........."
A barrier which took even her predecessor a significant amount of preparation...in an instant...
Ronove\'s face was by now twisted in shock.
And the surprise did not stop there......
The group of gold butterflies created two humanoid forms.
......It was a furniture summoning.
The butterflies peeled off and flew away, and beneath them, furniture in the shape of girls showed themselves.
"..................The Chiester Sisters troops...
 .........Even the Predecessor...
...wasn\'t able to summon the Pendragon\'s Memorial Troops on a moment\'s notice, and so easily...!"
"Chiester410. Right here."
"Chiester45. Right here."
"...You two are suitable furniture for me, right?"
"From reading you a picture book, to going on a friendship date, to shooting down a meteorite,
 we\'ll take care of anything. Nihihi."
"I-if we don\'t take care of it, the Dragon King will get mad at us...!
 Please, your orders, Great Lady BEATRICE!"
".........Rudolf-san.
 Let\'s run.
 These guys are no good......!"
"S-.........sure!"
Thanks to the same feeling that had alerted her to the ambush by the Seven Sisters of Purgatory,
 Kyrie clearly heard warning sirens going off in her head, almost resembling screams.
Without hesitation, they ran.
As the witch elegantly watched them leave, she ordered her new furniture.
"...This is an order.
 Kill the two who ran away.
 Then bring the corpses back here.
 Then I\'ll bring them back to life, and play with them over and over.
 ...*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!"
The witch\'s expression twisted with an evil smile.
Even though she feared that expression, Lucifer appeared and spoke.
"M-...my apologies.
 ...The Predecessor said to avoid brutal actions of that - "
When the witch stared at her with those terrifying eyes, Lucifer was struck dumb.
...She was unsatisfied.
 She was bored, of not being able to let her own power and her own cruelty run wild.
......Irritated by her predecessor\'s furniture telling her to act with restraint, her discontent was at its peak.
"Oh, it\'s Lucifer-chan the Proud.
 Long time no see nyeh, how ya doin\'?
 Let\'s play together again sometime.
 Nihhihihihihihi!"
"F-...410, you mustn\'t chat, you\'ll get in trouble...!
 Let us carry out the great Lady BEATRICE\'s order at once...!"
"Nihi.
 Looks like we\'re on the job right now nyeh."
"......410, understood.
 Preparing for sniping pursuit combat."
"Collecting terrain data, collecting firing data.
 Data link to 410."
"410, data received.
 Target acquired.
 Correcting for terrain.
 Forming firing curve, control points adjusted.
 Data link to 45."
"45, data received.
 Checking danger zone, ......ah, not there!"
"You\'re in the way behind us, Lucifer-chan,
 you\'ll get roasted in the backfire, you know? Nihi!"
".........nh..."
The Chiester sisters, through their mutual measurements,
 were able to instantly calculate the terrain inside the mansion and the coordinates of their targets, as well as a firing curve to reach them.
...Yes, their shots could be guided to draw a curved line.
No one would be able to escape it.
The precision homing ability of the Seven Sisters of Purgatory was nothing more than a cheap version of the ability these two held.
"45, firing preparations complete.
 Ammo selected, now loading."
The two of them faced each other,
 and, as though they were both pulling back a bowstring together,
 ...there, a dazzling golden arrow was readied.
"410, nihi.
 Firing."
After they proclaimed that they were firing, together, they released a single arrow.
As the curve taken by the gold-sparkling snake of light drew a trail,
 it headed in the direction Rudolf and Kyrie had run, in rapid pursuit.
It turned through the corridors, crawled over the floor, chasing them as it drew a beautiful curve.
No one could block the Chiester Sisters\' homing projectiles.
 No one could escape them.
 And their strength could pierce all physical and magical defenses.
......It was an all-too-merciless guided weapon of certain death.
However, among mythical-class soldiers, it was a weapon used by pretty much everyone.
 It was very commonplace for them, ...and very extraordinary for those of the everyday world.
"Wh-what the...?!"
When he noticed something rapidly chasing them, and turned around...
Rudolf was shot straight through the location of his heart by the gold snake.
 It all happened in an instant.
"R-Rudolf-san......?!"
After the gold snake ran Rudolf through,
 it swooped down to the floor, drawing a beautiful spiral, coiled itself around Kyrie\'s legs, and crawled up to her chest.
And just like Rudolf, it shot straight through the location of her heart.
...And all of that, too, happened in an instant.
It impaled Rudolf, and it impaled Kyrie.
So they died at almost the same time, dropped to their knees at the same time, and fell over at the same time.
"......What is thiiis?
 So overwhelming, ahhahahahahahahahahahahaha!
 That was ridiculously easy, wasn\'t it?
 Kuhhihihyahyahyahyahya!
 This is the kind of furniture I need.
 Way different from my predecessor\'s second-hand furniture!"
"Come on, bring their corpses here.
 I\'ll keep reviving them until I\'m bored, and try killing them in the most brutal ways I can think of.
 Aaah, to think that being a witch could be so much fun,
 that taking a life could be so much fun, ahhahahahahahahahahahaha!"
......The most shunned action to take for someone born a human is the murder of another human.
It\'s only natural for a human not to understand how pleasurable it is to break this taboo.
......But she was no longer a Human.
She was a witch.
...And there were some pleasures that only witches could understand.
By now, she had tasted those pleasures, and was totally immersed in them.
...After learning that the contents of the forbidden pot were honey, she could no longer live without it.
......No, maybe the contents were honey because they were forbidden.
In any case, the act of killing Humans gruesomely,
 and doing it over and over, was by now giving her a drug-like pleasure.
As the witch rolled over laughing,
 the gold snake which had just been fired returned as though being hauled back in.
The two were stitched at the tip and being dragged along.
The witch\'s order had been carried out.
...Rudolf and Kyrie had been killed instantly, and their bodies had been carried back.
"Chiester45, 410, execution of orders completed.
 We await your next order, Great Lady BEATRICE.
 Please, your order...!"
"From babysitting, to playing you in online multiplayer,
 to shooting down a space shuttle, we\'ll take care of everything.
 Nihihi!"
"............These two are apparently the sacrifices for the fourth twilight and the fifth twilight.
 So in the end, I need those worthless Seven Sisters,
 ...oh, I guess they\'re the Five Sisters now.
 I need those girls to pierce and gouge the forehead and the chest."
"......But I can do that at the very end, and I\'m free to play in any way until then, right?
 Eheheheheheheheheh!"
"Wait wait wait waait.
 ...Have you already forgotten what I told you?!"
"Oh, it\'s you, Predecessor-sama.
 Do you have any complaints?"
"Of course I do...!
 You are doing as you please, are you not?!
 Why can\'t you follow my directions?!"
"What\'s wrong with doing as I please, Predecessor-sama?
 And I haven\'t got the slightest desire to deviate from the rules of the ritual."
"I\'ll make sure to clean these two corpses up later, and drive stakes into their forehead and chest."
"I, I\'m telling you, that is not the problem...!
 If you act so undignified and cruel, uh,
 ...umm, some people might take it badly..."
"..............................
 ......You mean, your opponent in that game, who I heard you were fighting with somewhere?
 Ronove told me."
"......C-curse that blabbermouth.
 .........Well, to be perfectly honest, that\'s how it is.
 I had a complaint that, um,
 ...it is a little too much, you see?"
"It\'s not like there\'s any need for them to tell you to pass it on instead of objecting directly to me.
 ...That person is a coward."
".........Well, that person is a resident of, uh, a different world from this one, you see.
 There\'s no choice but to use me as an intermediary.
 Well, anyway, the point is - "
"........................
 ......Which means that this person can\'t interact with me even if they wanted to.
 And I can\'t interact with them even if I wanted to either.
 Am I correct to understand this as an unrelated person from a world that far away?"
"M-mm.
 ......By analogy, perhaps you could say these worlds are like two very close parallel lines.
 The worlds are very nearby, but since they are parallel lines, they will never cross.
 For the time being, you may view that world in such a manner."
"They never cross.
 Which means...
.........that world has nothing to do with me.
 ...If you\'re telling me on behalf of that person to show some restraint, please pass this message on to them."
"A message?
 What should I say...?"
"It\'s none of your business, so screw off, you old hag.
 Why don\'t you just give up and die forever...?"
"..................Wha - "
"...Oh, I\'m sorry.
 Since it was a friend of yours, I just imagined that she\'d be a woman.
 By "old hag", I\'m definitely not talking about youuu, Predecessor-sama, so please forgive me.
 *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*...!"
When she spoke, the witch was looking straight into Beato\'s eyes.
...Anyone in that place would be able to figure it out just by looking.
"............Predecessor-sama.
 There is something I find very strange.
 ...Why do you have to play a game with that person from another world,
 and have them accept that you are a witch?"
"Well, about that,
 ...that is because making all humans accept the existence of witches is related to perfect control.
 There was a single holdout, you see, and he just won\'t accept me as a witch."
".........Why is it that you need that Human\'s approval?
 Witches are witches, and they use magic; why do you need a Human\'s acknowledgement for this?"
"...Mh, .........well, like I said earlier, that which is called magic is - "
"I am a witch.
 I can use magic without anyone\'s approval in particular, so what\'s your point......?"
"In this world, right?
 However, since he will not accept it, umm,
 ...hmmmm, how should I explain it..."
"......I don\'t need an explanation.
 After all, isn\'t this all about a different world that never crosses this one?
 In other words, it\'s just as though that world doesn\'t exist."
"...............Whether you\'re fighting in a game in another world, or talking about your delusions, that doesn\'t change aaanything.
 ......I\'ll say it again.
 It has nothing to do with me.
 And I am already a witch."
"Predecessor-sama, somehow or another, it seems that you can\'t become a witch as long as this person doesn\'t accept you, but I\'m different.
 Even though no one has accepted me, I am already an excellent witch.
 .........Since you are my predecessor, I will formally pay you respect,
 but that is out of good will, not out of duty."
"......I do not seek your advice anymore,
 and I understand clearly what I should do now and how I should play from now on."
".........So I will carry out the ceremonial murder of the thirteen people as a final act of respect for you.
 However, as for the methods I use,
 and what I do after that, there is absolutely no reason I should be lectured by you on those.
 ..................Therefore, I\'ll be counting on you in that regard."
At a glance, those words seemed obedient, but they contained within them a clear parting of ways.
...They were saying, as clear as could be,
 "I have no more reason to rely on you, so don\'t get in the way of my fun".
Beato understood that,
 ...and was dejected, realizing that no matter how she explained it, she wouldn\'t be able to make the witch understand.
"...I, ............I see...
 Then it is no longer my problem...
 Go and learn first-hand how magic ceases to exist when you lose your feelings of respect for it."
"......That carefree rampage of yours up until now,
 I would dearly like to hear how it can be called respect."
After hearing that, Beato could not respond.
 ......Because she remembered hearing exactly the same thing from her master.
"So.
 Chiester Sisters?
 My predecessor is just leaving, please see her off."
"Nihihihihi.
 Predecessor-sama, please retire from this place."
"I-if you don\'t, we\'ll be scolded...!"
Throughout her body, Beato felt something invisible in the Chiester Sisters\' eyes which could only be described as an oppressive feeling.
......Most likely, they were initiating firing calculations.
It was an action much like taking out a gun and cocking it.
Even Beato could not escape from the Chiester Sisters\' attacks without any preparation.
...In the past, she had placed her greatest trust in them, so she knew down to her very soul how terrifying they were.
".........Predecessor-sama, if you would retire.
 .........I would not recommend damaging BEATRICE-sama\'s mood any further."
"......Predecessor-sama..."
"A-.........alright.
 ...I shall now take my leave.
 ......I shall take my time appreciating the circumstances you will put yourself in!"
That was as close as you could get to a loser\'s last retort.
...So after Beato hid herself, the witch and her furniture fell over laughing...
"............Well, I understand.
 Endless power is fun.
 ...The joy of freely toying with a life, the epitome of finite things, cannot be explained to those who have not tasted it.
 ......I can understand the feeling of being possessed with that pleasure."
"......It must have been quite fun.
 Judging from your antics in the past."
"Are you saying it is like how you used to admonish me in the past, Master, and I did not listen...?"
".........Why is it that you have started trying to scold that child for her actions?"
"Mh, ......umm, well.
 ........................"
"...There is a single large difference between you and that child.
 That child may already be a witch.
 Of course, you are also a witch.
 In the world on top of the game board."
"......However, to be accepted as a witch outside the game board,
 you need to have your opponent in this game, Battler-kun, accept you.
 ......You must have understood that when you started the game."
"......I thought that if I could show off a whirlwind of proof that I am a witch,
 blow away his feelings that made him deny me, and break him completely,
 .........he would accept me as a witch.
 ...It all went my way last time, so I thought I was just a breath away..."
"It\'s actually the opposite.
 Battler-kun was shocked by your brutality.
 And the reason he stepped up as your opponent was not because he accepted you as an equal opponent.
 It was based on a strong animosity, as he tried to completely deny the existence of a brutal witch."
".........In your foolishness, you probably felt that Battler-kun considering himself as your opponent...
was a first step towards making him accept that you are a witch.
 However, it was actually the exact opposite."
"Battler-kun challenged you in this game because he definitely would not accept you as a witch.
 ......No matter how much the thoughtless north wind blew, the traveler only wore his cloak even tighter.
 You were committing a huge error from the very beginning."
"............This game is not torture to break Battler-kun.
 It is a test, in which you must work hard to make Battler-kun accept you."
"...............
 ...I,
 ......I vaguely, you know,
 ...realized that..."
"Last time, it was a tough game for Battler-kun.
 But it seems that you\'ve already noticed.
 ......This time, the game is tough for you."
"Wh-...what should I do from now on?"
"Think about it yourself.
 ......Fortunately, you have already abandoned being a piece on the game board, and relegated things to the new witch.
 You should have time to deliberately ponder upon yourself."
"............But Battler\'s already a big ball of hostility.
 He won\'t accept witches, and he won\'t accept me.
 ......In that case, how do I make Battler accept me, then...?
 Are you saying that if the north wind doesn\'t work, ...then I should shine on him as the sun from now on...?
 I should, after all this time......?"
"It is October now.
 The Halloween season.
 .........It is the month of rebirth, when the sun dies and is revived again.
 When the sun is weak right after reviving, it may pale in comparison to the cold winter winds."
"However, it slowly grows, and is eventually able to hail the coming of spring.
 ...At that time, the traveler may even fold up his cloak."
".........So you say...
...that I am mistaken........."
...The beautiful hall of the Ushiromiya mansion was covered in a glow golden like gold leaf,
 ...and stained deep red with thick spurts of blood.
The number of deaths given to Rudolf and Kyrie had long surpassed anything you could count on both your fingers and your toes.
The witch was breathing so hard her shoulders shook, but it wasn\'t because she was tired.
...She just couldn\'t hide the ragged breathing caused by her still uncontainable excitement.
"Ahhahahahahahahahahahhahahahaha!!
 How fun it is to do as I will with the life and death of people!
 Before the power of the Endless Witch, every one of the infinities I paint with my mind becomes reality!"
"No matter how sloppily I mash them,
 I can revive them, returning them to normal with just a snap of my fingers."
"Because in the end, I just have to return the corpses to normal and make a token show of following the epitaph.
 Ahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!!"
"......Hey, you guys,
 have you ever sliced a stuffed animal\'s stomach open?"
"Never, nihi.
 What about you, 45?"
"N-no...!
 I have never done it, my apologies...!"
"Of course not.
 Normally, you wouldn\'t.
 ......Especially not if it was a stuffed animal you liked.
 But I\'ve always thought about it."
"I wondered what was packed inside this fluffy stuffed animal that I loved so much,
 and always thought I\'d like to peek inside one day."
If you cut it and looked inside, your curiosity might be quelled, but the stuffed animal would be broken.
......So even though you want to see, you can\'t.
You understand that feeling, right?
"......The power of the Endless Witch can grant exactly that wish.
 ...As I am now, I can slice the stuffed animal all I want."
"......And yet, with a bit of magic, I can revive it back to normal.
 ...In other words, it means that I have broken all limitations in this world.
 ......As I am now, I don\'t have to hesitate, refrain, or anything of the sort."
"That joy, ......aah, there\'s probably no one who can understand it.
 No one other than me, the Endless Witch!!"
As the witch let out a euphoric cry, she revived Rudolf and Kyrie again,
 and faster than they could realize it, she killed them right away.
......As she made it known that something other than cotton was stuffed inside those two.
"...G-
............give it a rest, Eva......!"
"Huh?
 ......Ah, you.
 You\'re here."
In that hall of tragedy, Hideyoshi showed himself, his gun readied.
The witch had sealed the mansion with a barrier, so Hideyoshi had nowhere to run.
...He had probably picked up Rudolf\'s or Kyrie\'s gun, and come back.
It seemed that the gun, which should have been something to be feared, was no longer an object she took seriously now that she was overflowing with magic power.
Her bold expression didn\'t flinch in the slightest.
".........Why\'d you have to kill Rosa-san and Maria-chan,
 ......and Rudolf-kun and Kyrie-san......?!"
"Huh?
 I am the head of the Ushiromiya family, and the witch of Rokkenjima.
 I am free to start whatever I like on this island.
 ...Just isolating this one instant and asking about their life and death within it is meaningless to me."
Hideyoshi was struck speechless by that all-too-callous response from the witch.
 Could someone\'s personality change so much just by finding Kinzo\'s gold......?
"Just how high was that gold piled?
 I can\'t even imagine it.
 It must have been enough to make you lose your sanity..."
"......Still, if there was that much gold,
 ......why didn\'t you think of graciously splittin\' it up...?!!"
"You misunderstand.
 ............All of that belongs to the Golden Witch.
 No one is qualified to touch it except for me.
 *giggle*giggle*giggle*, ahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha...!!"
"......What are you?
 Are you tryin\' to say you\'re that thing Eva told me about long ago......the witch Eva from when she was young?"
"That\'s right.
 I am me in my youth, who was always living in the heart of your wife, Ushiromiya Eva.
 ...And I\'m a witch.
 .........Eva became an adult by forgetting me.
 So she can\'t use magic."
"...Everyone fills their head sometimes with innocent yet cruel fantasies, as kids.
 Even me, when I was young, I\'d sometimes go around steppin\' on ants and pullin\' the wings off dragonflies.
 .........But you learn the importance of life, and grow out of that cruel childhood age."
"......Right now, you really are a child, y\'know!
 ...A personality that Eva should have outgrown!
 That\'s not Eva.
 It\'s a different human!!"
"That\'s right.
 I am not Ushiromiya Eva.
 I\'m the Golden Witch, BEATRICE."
"It\'s so fun, not being bounded by any limitations, and the pleasure of being able to do as I will with life and death is truly wonderful...!
 I don\'t have to apologize for breaking the goldfish bowl,
 and I can tear the stuffed animal as much as I want!
 I - "
A dry sound.
...It was the sound of Hideyoshi slapping the witch\'s face.
By looking at the hall stained deep red with fresh blood, he should have been able to imagine how terrible the witch was.
But without fear, without even hesitating, Hideyoshi had walked determinedly up to her, and hit her on the cheek.
"....................."
"You dolt!!
 Don\'t act like you\'re cruel, not when you\'re really a coward and a weaklin\'!
 I\'ll keep you on the straight and narrow, you wicked woman!!
 You dumbo!
 Nitwit!!"
"Ow,
 ......ouch,
 ...hey...!"
"You used to be a woman who understood how important, how fragile a life is!
 I\'ll knock some sense back into you...!!
 What\'s all this about witches, what a load of crock!!"
"You\'re my wife, Ushiromiya Eva!
 A witch of the kitchen, thoughtfully whippin\' up snacks from leftovers in the fridge, that\'s the only witch you are!!
 Open your eyes, you blunderin\' dolt...!!"
"Didn\'t I just say...
that I\'m not Ushiromiya Eva......?!"
"That\'s horsecrap!!
 You!
 You!!"
As tears dripped down his face, Hideyoshi kept hitting the witch\'s head.
He wasn\'t even pointing the gun at her anymore.
So.
 That sound of gunfire couldn\'t have come from the gun Hideyoshi was holding.
......The gun, which had fallen in the corner near Rudolf\'s body, was floating in the air,
 ...and smoke lingered near the barrel.
And the bullet?
 .........A red stain was slowly spreading across the chest of Hideyoshi\'s vest.
Even though his back was facing the barrel of the gun, ...the bullet was embedded in Hideyoshi\'s chest.
".........E...
va............
 ............uu..."
"...I told you, I\'m not Eva.
 What a stupid, annoying man."
"......You\'re a pain, so I\'ll switch the sacrifice for the sixth twilight to you.
 ...If you\'d just stayed hidden under a bed quivering or something, I\'d planned to let you go.
 ......You deliberately came back.
 You really are a stupid man."
Thunk...
 There was a dull sound as Hideyoshi fell to the floor.
Even though he would be able to escape his pain by dying, he resisted that until the last second,
 and staring straight into the witch\'s eyes, ...he passed away.
Because he had died without closing his eyes, for a short while, the witch didn\'t realize that he was dead,
 and she remained pinned down by that gaze.
"Will we make this one a new toy and play?
 Nihi."
At those words, the witch finally realized that Hideyoshi was dead.
".........nn, ...ahh.
 ...Right, what\'ll we do..."
The Chiester Sisters waited for instructions.
On the inside, they imagined an order even more brutal than before from their master.
But the expression that rose to the witch\'s face looked as though she had gotten over her excitement.
She looked down at Hideyoshi\'s face, which still had tears dripping down it...
"......This guy totally ruined my mood.
 Yeeeah, I\'m done.
 .........Ronove, you there?"
"Yes, right here."
"Clean up, please.
 ...My predecessor will be annoying.
 Please make it clean enough so that the old hag will accept it. ......And I guess I will follow the rules of the ritual, out of responsibility to my predecessor.
 Please make these three corpses the fourth twilight through the sixth twilight."
"Lucifer, you\'re up."
"Lucifer the Proud, right here."
"Dig into these three corpses and gouge them."
"I-...into the corpses?"
"That\'s right.
 You have a problem with that?"
"N-...no..."
The Seven Sisters of Purgatory had a modest sense of pride.
 It was the pride of a hunter, the pride of gouging prey that they had brought down themselves.
...However, being told to gouge a corpse that someone else had brought down ran contrary to that feeling.
 Of course, that was not the witch\'s intention, but for the Seven Sisters, it was horribly humiliating.
...However, they had already messed up, with two of the sisters defeated, so they had no right to question her.
Only Ronove appreciated that, and he rested his hand on her shoulder in understanding.
"......It is BEATRICE-sama\'s order.
 Lucifer, carry the three, and deal with them according to the protocol of the ritual.
 Then, when you are done, lend me a hand with the cleanup."
"Certainly......"
The witch looked down upon Hideyoshi\'s corpse, as though implying that this somehow weird atmosphere was all Hideyoshi\'s fault.
".........Stupid man.
 You didn\'t even have to die."
"Honey......!!!
 Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!!
 Honey, where are you?!
 You\'re there, right?
 Answer me!!"
The sound of a loud thunderbolt woke Eva from her nightmare.
If Hideyoshi had been gripping her hand at that time, her fearful heart would probably have been instantly healed.
However, Hideyoshi, who had sworn that he wouldn\'t leave even for a moment, was nowhere to be seen in the room.
"Honey,
 ...answer me...
 .........Honey...!!
 Uuuuuhhuuuuuughhhuu!!"
