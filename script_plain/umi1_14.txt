"......At any rate, we\'ll lock this room and leave everything as it is until the police come.
 ......All agreed?"
Natsuhi proclaimed it as though she didn\'t care whether they agreed or not.
...If anyone had a right to object, it would have been George, ...but he looked as though he had shed enough tears.
Still facing away from them, George nodded slightly and rose to his feet, and everyone else agreed in response.
Natsuhi still hadn\'t opened the head\'s Western‐style envelope she had picked up.
{n}...But since they would all be leaving the room now, she decided that she would unseal it in the parlor, where everyone could watch.
As soon as they walked out into the hallway to head back to the parlor,
 .........some of them immediately felt something out of place, ...or maybe sensed something strange.
"...............Uu.
 ......Stinky."
"Ah, ...you notice it too, Maria?
 ...What is this stench... It smells awful..."
As they all sniffed the air,
 ...they did notice a horribly foul burnt smell, unlike anything any of them had ever smelled before, drifting through the hallway.
"......I will go quickly to check the kitchen...
 I\'m sure I turned the flame off......"
After noticing a burnt smell, it was natural that Kumasawa, who had just been cooking in the kitchen, suspected that her own clumsiness had caused it.
 Kumasawa hastily dashed away.
"......Kanon, go with Kumasawa.
 Do not let her be alone."
"Y‐yes...!"
After nodding at Genji\'s order, Kanon went chasing after her.
{n}...The others, although they did not run, also followed in order to search for the source of the smell.
"...Uu.
 Stinky.
 ......Uuu."
"It truly is......a stench that makes the nose wrinkle.
 ...However, I am not sure it would be safe to open a window for ventilation..."
Natsuhi was reluctant to open the windows in a situation where self‐defense was so important.
"......Let us run the fan.
 I do not believe there will be any need to open the windows."
"...George‐aniki.
 ......Is it okay if I talk to you?"
"......If it\'s about finding the killer, then I have no problems."
It seemed that George had already climbed out of the abyss of his sorrow.
...All that filled his chest now was the quiet flame of hatred towards the killer who had stolen the lives of his beloved parents.
"...The chain for the room was set.
 ...From what I could tell by looking at it, I\'m positive that it couldn\'t be opened from the outside.
 ......In other words, that means it was a perfect locked room."
".........Yes, it does.
 In the case of the rose garden storehouse, they might have sneaked the shutter\'s key out of the servant room,
 or maybe they had a duplicate key... I can imagine many ways they could\'ve done it."
".........But this chain is different.
 Among generally used locking techniques, a chain is the simplest one to create a locked room with."
"Only a chain will block everyone coming from the outside as long as it isn\'t physically broken.
 So does this mean that the culprit couldn\'t have gone in or out through the door...?"
"......That\'s interesting.
 Just a few hours ago, I seem to remember everyone making a fuss over how to get out of a room without using the door."
Back then, everyone had been making a fuss over how Grandfather had disappeared from his room.
Because of the receipt that Auntie Eva had stuck in the door on a whim, it was revealed that the door had remained sealed,
 and since Aunt Natsuhi had been the only person to enter or exit during that time, she had come under suspicion.
Auntie Eva had proposed a theory about how Aunt Natsuhi might have thrown Grandfather out the window,
 and left by the door herself.
But this door is much simpler.
It was sealed from the inside by the door chain.
{n}The window had also been closed from the inside, and the bodies had been in the room.
......This time it really was, without exaggeration, a true locked room.
...That\'s right.
 If you include Grandfather\'s disappearance, three incidents have occurred, and all three times, the door has been the point of interest.
The first was the shutter.
There was a key in the servant room, and if we assume someone knew about that, this can\'t really be called a locked room.
The next was the door sealed by the receipt.
However, since Aunt Natsuhi had entered the room,
 she could have let Grandfather out through the window, or thrown him out, and she would have been able to lock the window before leaving.
Or, like my crazy theory, he could have hidden until the receipt was gone, and left the room later.
 ......Basically, this door can be defeated with a handful of desperate tricks.
In that sense, you really can\'t call this one a locked room either.
And now, we have the door sealed with the door chain.
...Finally, we have to give up.
{n}The window, the door...everything had been locked from the inside.
 It was a perfect locked room.
The first hadn\'t been a locked room because everyone could be suspected.
{n}...The second hadn\'t been a locked room because Aunt Natsuhi could be suspected.
...But this time, no one can be suspected!
{n}This room was a perfect locked room, sealed by a door chain that denied access equally to everyone...!
"......In that case, did the culprit carry out the crime without entering the room...?
 Some method from outside the room...?"
"Good thought...
 It is a chain, so even though it can\'t be opened wide enough for a person to fit through, you can open it a small crack.
 The culprit could knock on the door to make them peer out before attacking them, or...
 Wait, ...is that naive...?"
"Yeah, it is.
 .........If Auntie Eva\'s body had been lying right next to the door, then it might have been possible."
"But she was on the bed in the center of the room!
 And Uncle Hideyoshi was even in the bathroom.
 Looking from the crack in the door, you couldn\'t even see them, and you couldn\'t reach them with your hands either.
 ......Damn it, this is no goddamn good at all, I don\'t have a clue!!"
......Something was tugging softly at my sleeve.
 ...It was Maria.
"............Uu.
 ...Satisfied?"
"What do you mean "satisfied"?"
".........Kihihihihihihihihihihihihi.
 ...Battler, since you didn\'t want to doubt any of your relatives...you made a wish, saying that you wanted the culprit to be {f:5:Beatrice}, right?"
"Well, {f:5:Beatrice} granted your wish.
 ...Just as you said, she did it "in a way that no human could, to make you believe in the witch"."
"............Yet you\'re being stubborn.
 Kihihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihi.
 Ouch."
I tapped Maria, who was laughing unpleasantly, on the head with my fist.
"Sure, thanks for granting it.
 That was an expression of my gratitude, and a free lesson in not laughing at times like this.
 More importantly, tell me.
 There was more mysterious graffiti on the door to Auntie Eva and Uncle Hideyoshi\'s room.
 Was that another magic circle?!"
"......Kihihihihihihihi.
 It has an especially memorable and characteristic design, so I\'d hoped you\'d at least know that one.
 Ouch."
"I don\'t know, that\'s why I\'ve handed the stage over to you.
 Quit whining and explain."
".........You sure are violent, Battler.
 I won\'t tell you if you\'re too mean, get it......?
 Ouch!
 Uu...... I\'ll say it, I\'ll say it, you brutish man.
 .........That\'s the first magic circle of the moon."
"What does it mean?
 What is this magic circle\'s benefit?!
 What does the Hebrew writing mean?!"
"The words are from the Old Testament, Psalm 107, verse 16.
 ......‘For he has broken the gates of brass and cut through bars of iron’.
 ......This magic circle has two effects.
 First, it can open any door regardless of the method used to lock it."
"That sure is convenient magic.
 ...So your witch is proclaiming this to be a door that can\'t be opened without relying on the power of magic...?!
 And the other effect?!"
"It takes the unopening door as a representation of an unassailable situation, and opens it.
 ......By using it in a difficult situation, it gives you a solution you hadn\'t even thought of until then.
 ......To put it simply, it grants the powers of observation and discernment, inspiration and intuition."
"............Kihihihihihihihihihi.
 {f:5:Beatrice} is trying to provoke you lowly humans, since she thinks there\'s no way you could ever understand how this door was opened.
 Kihhihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihi..."
"Ouch."
"Alright, good work, now shut up.
 ......Suits me fine. I accept that witch\'s challenge!"
"......Maria‐chan.
 ...Things like witches and demons don\'t exist in this world.
 ...Someone killed Mother and Father!
 I don\'t know whether that was someone I know or not.
 But either way, it was definitely a human...!!"
".........Yeah, but......how?
 How did they reach them through a crack in the door that couldn\'t have been more than ten centimeters wide...!"
"At any rate, I can hardly stand this stench.
 ......What in the world could it be...?!"
Kanon and Kumasawa, who had gone ahead, realized before they even reached the kitchen that the smell wasn\'t coming from there.
That was because, on their way to the kitchen, they noticed that an even thicker wave of stench was rising up from the stairs leading to the basement.
".........The boiler room..."
"......I wonder if there\'s something wrong with the boiler again..."
Those stairs led to the underground boiler room.
The mansion\'s boiler was old, and had been playing up recently.
{n}Both of them had witnessed problems with the boiler on several occasions, but they had never smelled it belching out a stench like this before.
Slam.
"Wh‐what was that sound......?!"
The sound that they had heard from the basement had definitely been the sound of a door closing.
{n}......Although she did phrase it as a question, Kumasawa too had already realized that the sound couldn\'t have been anything else.
Kumasawa was so surprised at that sound that her knees gave way yet again and she cowered...
......Because, {i:at that very moment, no one could have been in the boiler room}.
Just a few seconds ago, everyone had been crowded together in Eva and Hideyoshi\'s room!
{n}So who caused the sound of a door closing just now?!
".................................!"
"Kanon‐san...!!"
Instantly gathering the situation, Kanon ran down towards the basement...!
Since they had heard the sound of a door closing just now, and there was no trace of someone climbing the stairs, it meant that the person who had closed the door was now inside the boiler room.
If the boiler room had been a dead end, Kanon wouldn\'t have rushed in so hastily.
...But Kanon was a servant, so he knew.
{n}There were two entrances, one that opened to the mansion and one that opened to the courtyard.
If he didn\'t chase them now, they might slip away...!
Kumasawa reached the same conclusion long after Kanon did.
{n}...But she couldn\'t let him go alone...!
If the thing in the boiler room was the killer,
 ...an opponent who had easily killed six adults in the first murder,
 then Kanon would be no match if he simply confronted them alone.
...Of course, by this argument, Kumasawa joining him alone wouldn\'t mean anything, but...
At any rate, after a delay, Kumasawa decided that she mustn\'t let Kanon go alone, and she dashed down the stairs...!!
At that time, Kanon was already in the boiler room.
The boiler room\'s characteristic damp heat tormented him.
{n}...It had always been an unpleasantly smelly and hot place.
And on top of that, the room was full of that horrible stench...which made Kanon feel like he was going to be sick.
......There was no doubt that this room was the origin.
In that case, Kanon should have been searching for where the smell was coming from.
However, Kanon kept gazing straight forward as he grabbed a hatchet from a tool shelf just off to the side of the door.
...He hadn\'t stretched out his hand because he\'d wanted a hatchet.
 ...He had wanted to grab a weapon, any weapon.
 ...Why?
"..................................................."
Kanon gazed into the darkness where the naked light bulb couldn\'t pierce.
{n}......Then, he {i:answered}.
"..................In roulette, you bet on a number or the colors red or black, vying for a payoff.
 ......However, low risk bets like red or black only offer a similarly low payoff."
The words coming from Kanon\'s mouth...were swallowed up by the darkness.
That darkness suddenly started to swirl, glittering...
It was......a very fantastical scene...
Golden sparkling butterflies that hid in the shadows all over the boiler room...
flapped their wings, twinkling beautifully, ...and disappeared into the darkness, gathering together...
Kanon continued speaking, directing his words at the darkness as it swallowed the butterflies up.
{n}......But as the butterflies gathered in the darkness, they...{0}...{0}...perhaps...{0}probably...{0}no, they must have...{0}...laughed.
...But Kanon continued to speak without faltering in the slightest.
"...On the other hand, if you bet on something of a lower probability, you receive a payoff proportional to the risk.
 ............The Master called succeeding despite an astronomical risk a "miracle",
 and called the astronomical payoff gained as a result "magic"."
"............I have no interest what kind of "magic" you and the Master were seeking when you spun that roulette......
 But you forgot something.
 ......You forgot that roulette has a pocket that is neither red nor black."
Roulette has a special pocket called "0", which means that the house takes everything in certain variants of the game—
meaning that all of the coins bet on the table will be swept up, just as though everyone has forfeit...
".........I set my heart on one thing.
 ...That if...
......Shannon were to be killed, and I was left alive,
 .........I would bring this roulette of yours to ruin even at the cost of my life...!"
"............This isn\'t one of the Master\'s rules, ...and it certainly isn\'t one of yours.
 .........I made this rule myself.
 .........I\'m not furniture anymore.
 .........I\'m the zero on your roulette...!"
...Kanon\'s face twisted with humiliation.
{n}.........It was clear that he had been dealt ridicule in response to his self‐denial.
Kanon\'s brow creased even further, ...and a furious expression that he had never shown anyone appeared on his face.
......The hand grasping the hatchet was shaking.
 ...His sweat became drops which slid down...
It was clear that the emotion causing Kanon\'s hand to shake was not anger alone.
...However, Kanon suppressed that emotion...
".....................I won\'t let your words lead me astray again.
 .........This is where the Demons\' Roulette ends."
"...W‐
......wait another thousand years in hell for your next summoner,
 {f:5:Beatriceeeeeeee}!!!"
When Kanon swung the hatchet upwards and tried to dive into the darkness, the darkness definitely sneered.
It sneered at that courage as vulgar, lazy, futile, and meaningless.
......Kanon, his hatchet still held aloft,
 .........couldn\'t take another step after that...
With a clang,
 the hatchet that Kanon had been grasping fell and rolled on the floor...
And following that, with a pair of thuds,
 Kanon\'s knees hit, ...left, then right...
That hand, which looked like it was trying to catch the sky now that the hatchet had been dropped, gradually lowered,
 ......and rested on his chest.
 Then, the other hand did the same.
......Right there, ......was a handle with a demon‐shaped design engraved upon it.
{n}The same type of weapon that had been stabbed into Eva and Hideyoshi\'s foreheads......was in Kanon\'s chest......
"...............u
.....................ghh,
 ............"
Fresh blood dribbled from the corner of Kanon\'s mouth as it twisted in anguish...
{n}...It was...makeup too powerful for Kanon\'s white skin...
Around this scene, the glittering gold butterflies danced mesmerizingly through the darkness...
It was a beautiful, beautiful dance—a funeral march of tribute, ridicule, and contempt for a single boy\'s self‐sacrifice.
...Kanon had already been prepared for his own death,
 ......but he attempted one last measure of resistance, to reject death in at least the form it had been delivered to him.
...With both hands, he grasped the handle of the weapon sticking into his chest,
 ............and gritting his teeth at the acute, unearthly pain...............
 ..............................he pulled it out.
For only a moment, a bright‐red spray gushed out.
......It made an unpleasant bloop sound.
It probably resembled the sound of Kanon\'s soul as it was sucked into the swamp of the dead...
"...............Kanon‐san?!
 Hiiiiiiiii!!!
 So‐someoooooooone!!
 Hiiiiiiiii!!"
Kumasawa screamed at the incomprehensible sight in front of her.
Kanon was lying in a pool of blood...
{n}...Kumasawa\'s heart was a complete mess.
Aah, what a terrible fate!
{n}He wouldn\'t have been killed if I had been with him!
Aah, what incredible fortune!
{n}If I had been with him, I might have been killed too!!
As she screamed, her expression was filled with complete confusion, and all of the muscles of her face were pulled up, almost as though she was smiling while crying...
{n}No one could have made fun of an expression such as this...!!
"What is it, Kumasawa?!!
 Answer me, Kumasawa!!!"
The first one to dash in was Natsuhi, with rifle at the ready.
Battler and Genji dashed in after her.
Normally, they probably would\'ve started discussing the origin of that violent stench filling the boiler room.
......But after they saw Kanon, who was lying on the ground as if he were drowning in an ocean of his own blood, the stench wasn\'t important any more.
"Kanon!
 Answer me!!
 ......Genji, bring Doctor Nanjo here!!"
Natsuhi realized that even though Kanon was on the verge of death, he was still conscious, so she sent Genji to get the doctor.
...Natsuhi, holding the rifle aloft, faced the darkness in the center of the boiler room and shouted!
"......Who is hiding over there?!!!
 Come out quietly!!
 If you don\'t come out from there, I\'ll shoot without mercy!!"
"A flashlight!
 Auntie, let\'s light \'em up!!"
Battler, thinking quickly, took a large flashlight from the tool shelf alongside the door and used its light to cut through the darkness Natsuhi was glaring into.
But the light only shone on mechanical‐looking piping and a door.
The door had been left open a small crack, and it was obvious that someone had left through there in a hurry.
"......Aunt Natsuhi, where does that door go?!"
"G‐Genji...!
 Where does that door lead to?!"
"...The, the courtyard...!"
"L‐like hell I\'d let you get away, you damn bastaaaaaaaard!!!"
Battler let out a war cry as he slammed into the door.
Cool air from outside suddenly rushed in.
...There were some thin, rough stairs leading up.
{n}...Battler ran up them, shouting!
"Wait, Battler‐kun!!
 It\'s dangerous to be alone!!"
Natsuhi also rushed up the stairs, chasing after Battler.
At the top was the courtyard.
{n}...The courtyard of the mansion had been built strictly for lighting purposes, so it wasn\'t a very elegant place.
Because it was surrounded on all sides, the air was calm and completely undisturbed, even though they could hear the sound of strong winds.
There was only the gentle, sorrowful rain...
Through the cold scattered raindrops, Battler dashed up the stairs and into the courtyard, where he looked in every direction.
......Of course, the odds of him finding a suspicious silhouette just standing around nonchalantly were pretty much zero...
Battler turned around, looking in all directions.
 He turned again and again.
{n}He kept spinning until he almost lost his sense of direction.
{n}He prayed that he would see the culprit somewhere in this scenery...!
But there was no chance.
 All he saw as he spun was more and more of the mansion\'s heartless walls and windows...!
Furthermore, there were two entrances into the mansion from the courtyard, and neither of them were locked.
Because the courtyard couldn\'t be entered from outside the mansion, the doors had been built without locks.
......He couldn\'t tell which one they had left through!
{n}He had to give up.
Battler pounded the wall with his fist, swearing...
"......Battler‐kun!!
 You mustn\'t run ahead by yourself!!
 ........................
 ............Battler‐kun......?"
Battler put his head against the wall, ...and scratched at it with his fingernails as he cried...
".........Shit, ......shit, shit...!!
 Auntie Eva and Uncle Hideyoshi!
 And now Kanon‐kun too?!!!
 You killed six whole people!!
 And that wasn\'t enough, so you killed three more!!"
"Fuck you, fuck youuuuuuu!!
 Auntie Eva and Uncle Hideyoshi were always fun and kind to us...!!
 I just met Kanon‐kun yesterday, but I\'m sure I\'d have gotten along fine with him!
 Why did you kill them?!!"
"Why, why...?!!!
 When people die, they don\'t come back to life again, you know?!
 They aren\'t gonna quickly sprout up again like bamboo shoots!
 .........Why would you kill them?!
 Why...
 Why...?!!!
 Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh...!!"
...Battler was a boy who could understand the feelings of pain and regret in a person\'s heart.
{n}...So he cried.
 With all his strength.
Natsuhi, who had always thought of Battler as a strong person, was a little surprised to find that he had this delicate side,
 ...and at the same time, understood how easily hurt the heart of a young person could be, so she held him.
"........................It\'s alright.
 ...I will definitely protect you, George‐kun, Maria‐chan, and Jessica.
 .........As a mother, ...and as the representative of the Ushiromiya family...!"
"......uuuUUuuUuuUUUuughhhu!!
 AaaaaaAAAAAAAAhhh!!"
Battler, after sobbing into Natsuhi\'s chest for a while,
 wiped his tears with a bitter smile, and tried to convey that he had cried more than enough already, just as he had done the times before...
"Anyway, let\'s go back down for now.
 ......Protecting ourselves is a higher priority than finding the culprit.
 Tomorrow, the boat will arrive.
 After that happens, the police will come, and everything should be brought to light.
 .........There\'s no way the killer can escape this island, no matter how much they struggle...!!"
"......Right.
 ...When the police come..."
When the seagulls cry, ...the crime will be solved.
But, ...for some reason, Battler felt a slight sense of uneasiness...as if the seagulls would never cry again.
......That couldn\'t be true.
{n}When the typhoon passes, the lively seagulls should return to the harbor again......
I returned to the boiler room along with Aunt Natsuhi and told the room weakly that we hadn\'t found anything.
They told me that Doctor Nanjo and George‐aniki had carried Kanon‐kun to the servant room.
The servant room had a first‐aid kit and a sink, and could apparently function as a nurse\'s office.
Kumasawa‐san and Jessica had accompanied them.
...Stains from Kanon‐kun\'s blood remained on the floor.
Judging by the large amount of blood lost and the ruthless shape of the weapon that had fallen unceremoniously to the ground,
 ......I figured that Doctor Nanjo\'s treatment would probably end in vain...
That weapon was doubtlessly the same type that had been stuck in Auntie Eva and Uncle Hideyoshi\'s foreheads.
......But wait, isn\'t the demonic design on the handle a little different...?
There seemed to be some small differences in that part.
 Still, as far as their overall shape was concerned, the weapons were all of the same type.
Though it had seemed brutal, we\'d left the weapons stuck into Auntie Eva and Uncle Hideyoshi to preserve the crime scene.
...So this was the first time I was able to have a perfect view of the entire weapon.
Indeed, the weapon was not bladed like a knife, but shaped like an icepick,
 ...or rather, a thin stake.
And also, ...it had a spiral‐shaped design, sort of like a drill?
...To use a disturbing analogy, it looked like something that might be driven into the hearts of human sacrifices in some demonic ritual...
Including the handle, it was about twenty‐five centimeters long.
 Half of that was the stake‐shaped part, which was stained with deep red blood.
......The length of the blood‐stained part made it clear just how deeply it must have penetrated into Kanon‐kun\'s chest...
But Aunt Natsuhi and the rest were not even looking at the weapon, instead standing in front of the incinerator, where the horrible stench was emanating from.
They had probably pulled {i:that} out of the furnace, where it must have been burning.
...It was still smoldering and kept sending out dense waves of that awfully unpleasant smell...
Genji‐san and Maria were staring down at it.
Aunt Natsuhi probably couldn\'t stand to look directly at it.
 ...She kept shaking her head, her back to it.
"........................ug...!"
...I\'d thought that after everything that\'s happened, nothing could surprise me anymore, but...
...this was...
...gghh...!
I stood there for a while, moaning, with a rising urge to vomit...
.........The true nature of that unearthly stench...
......was the charred smell from within the incinerator...
of a burning corpse......
The clothes, the surface of the body, and the hair were all hideously burned.
 That grotesque corpse was in a state where not the face, nor the age, nor even the gender could be guessed at...
But when I thought about it calmly, I realized that a corpse appearing at this time could only be one person.
.........Grandfather,
 who had disappeared that morning, and whose whereabouts had been unknown.
".........I believe...it is most likely the Master."
"...............I...agree.
 ............That he would pass away in such a state......
 .........How heartrending..."
"...But is there any proof that this corpse......really is Grandfather...?
 It\'s burnt so black, you can\'t even tell what sex it is..."
"Battler‐kun, ...look at the feet."
Aunt Natsuhi, with her handkerchief over her mouth and her eyes averted, pointed and told me to look at the burnt corpse\'s feet.
..................?
"......The toes, on both feet. Look closely."
"Huh?
 ..................ah,
 ......you\'re right........."
Just as Genji‐san had said, there were six toes on each foot.
Each of the toes had been arranged so normally that I hadn\'t noticed...
"......The Master had these uniquely characteristic toes since birth.
 ...Consequently, the Master was entrusted with the revival of the Ushiromiya family."
"I have heard that since long ago, cases of polydactyly were common in the Ushiromiya family.
 ...It\'s probably hereditary."
Polydactyly literally means "many fingers".
Because of a little mistake by God when the person is born, one of their toes or fingers splits into two, and the total number increases.
But a big deal isn\'t usually made of polydactyly in the world at large.
{n}That\'s because it isn\'t a disease, but something people are born with.
So the hospital is already aware of it when they are still babies, and at about the time they turn one year old, they are given surgery to make them normal.
So, even if a child has polydactyly, it is treated before they become self‐aware, so they might not even remember it themselves.
Incidentally, it seems that it can occur with a probability of about one in every two thousand babies,
 so even though it\'s not usually seen, it isn\'t that rare at all.
Speaking of which, I think Uncle Hideyoshi mentioned something to me long ago.
 ...Something about how even Toyotomi Hideyoshi, the man who unified Japan at the end of the Sengoku period, possessed six fingers on one hand...
According to Aunt Natsuhi, among the many Ushiromiya family heads, the ones praised most for their wisdom had all possessed polydactyly.
......Because of that, when Grandfather was born, his relatives were all excited at the thought that he might become another wise leader.
 And, when the leading relatives all died in the Great Kanto Earthquake, it was apparently argued that if anyone could restore the family from that,
 it would be Grandfather, because of the auspicious sign of his birth.
If Grandfather thought being the head was not a bad gig, this sixth toe must have been pretty lucky for him.
......Come to think of it, I think I\'ve heard about some country where it\'s believed that people with polydactyly should be treated as gods and revered...
This is beside the point, but it\'s fairly common in mystery novels for a corpse to be burned to hide whose body it is.
......But it looks like in Grandfather\'s case, just being toasted wasn\'t enough to hide the proof of his identity...
And......Grandfather\'s body was not simply burnt.
......Just like Auntie Eva and Uncle Hideyoshi, ...and Kanon‐kun too, who had been stabbed in his chest,
 he had one of those "demon\'s icepicks"...stuck into his forehead......!
"............The "Head\'s Ring" is not on his finger."
"...So everything is as the letter last night said.
 ..................Father...
...would probably be horribly disappointed......"
Aunt Natsuhi let her head droop and closed her eyes tightly...
......This room had also become a vital crime scene for us to hand over to the police.
......It was decided that we would leave Grandfather\'s corpse here and lock the room, sealing it.
It wasn\'t clear when Grandfather\'s corpse started burning in the incinerator.
Since, according to Genji‐san, the flames hadn\'t been that strong, the body must have started burning a long time ago,
 and that stench must have slowly crept out of the furnace and filled the room bit by bit, eventually pouring out and climbing up the staircase.
......Putting aside whether he was rare or well‐done,
 Grandfather had been brought out, killed, and burned...even though he had started out in the locked room created by his auto‐lock.
 ...There\'s probably no doubting this...
However, according to Genji‐san, the boiler room is usually locked.
......The probability that someone outside our group was lurking around committing the crimes was now overwhelmingly high,
 and there was also a good chance that this person was walking around with something like a master key.
...After all, the doors and windows throughout the mansion had been checked.
But despite that, the culprit was freely strutting around the mansion.
After this latest crime, can we now be sure that a 19th person exists?
{n}They haven\'t shown themselves once, and yet they\'re trying to tout their existence.
Along with Kyrie‐san\'s chessboard theory, I\'ve been using this contradiction to deny the existence of a 19th person.
...By flipping over the chessboard once more,
 the very fact that this crime makes it perfectly obvious that a 19th person exists...
means that the existence of the 19th person is even less possible.
 As long as that 19th person doesn\'t show themselves in front of us...!
......If the culprit could get Grandfather out through the door sealed by the receipt,
 if they could kill Auntie Eva and Uncle Hideyoshi from the other side of a door sealed by a chain,
 ......then is it possible for them to even create a fictional 19th person through strange tricks and devices...?!?!
If we still want to believe that the culprit is among us,
 ......then the list of suspects is very short.
The four of us kids, Aunt Natsuhi.
{n}Genji‐san,
 Kumasawa baa‐chan,
 and Doctor Nanjo.
{n}...One of these people has to be the culprit!
Wait, we can\'t be sure of that.
 ......Just a second ago, we started doubting whether the body here was actually Grandfather\'s, right?
...Maybe we should try thinking of the other bodies in the same way.
For example, the first six all had their faces horribly destroyed.
......Some of the bodies had kept enough of their faces for us to confirm who they were, but my old bastard, for example...
had lost his entire face, as though it had been peeled off...
We\'d only figured out which body was which by their clothes and surroundings...
Had the culprit prepared a fake corpse beforehand and disguised it to make it look like they\'d died...then hid somewhere and continued their killing spree...?
...It sounds ridiculous, but that doesn\'t mean it\'s an impossible trick.
......It\'s too early to give in to this 19th person,
 ......no, .........this witch......!
"Maria‐chan, you mustn\'t stare so fixedly anymore.
 Come on, Battler‐kun too.
 I am worried about Kanon\'s condition, and I don\'t want to stay in a place like this any longer than I have to.
 Let\'s go back."
"......Uu."
Maria hadn\'t gone out with everyone else, but had remained in the boiler room.
The thing she was staring fixedly at was probably...
not Grandfather\'s body, but the "demon\'s icepick" that was sticking out of his forehead.
...No doubt an irresistible item for the obsessed.
I rapped her on the head.
"Hey, Maria.
 ......What\'s {f:5:Beatrice} after?
 Is it all of our lives...?"
"......Kihihihihihihihi.
 {f:5:Beatrice} will revive very soon.
 ...At that time, none shall be left alive.
 ...Kihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihi."
"How can you laugh at something like that?
 Do you think you\'re the only one who\'s safe?
 Why don\'t you feel like you\'re in danger?
 Why aren\'t you scared?!"
"......{f:5:Beatrice} promised me.
 ...She said that she\'s going to take me to the Golden Land."
".........It\'s a wonderful place where you have no obligations, everyone\'s always together, and everyone is always nice to everyone else."
".........I\'m looking forward to it, you know?
 That time will come, very soon now.
 ...Kihihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihi..."
...Just what kind of person is Maria...?
.........I only know what Maria was like six years ago, when she was three.
{n}She had been pure and obedient—a good kid.
This new Maria six years later and the Maria I knew, ...didn\'t seem to fit together.
......Just who is she, this "witch" who calls herself Maria...?
To her, with her obstinate belief in witches,
 ......this series of unsolvable crimes is proof that witches actually exist.
Every time something occurs that would be difficult for a human, it becomes a little harder for the rest of us to not believe in that witch called {f:5:Beatrice}.
It must be an "intense pleasure" for Maria...to see her relatives, who once firmly denied the witch\'s existence,
 start acknowledging her existence one by one...
......Is that why she\'s in high spirits...?
".........Maria,
 let me ask this one more time.
 You\'ll probably answer the same anyway, but I\'ll ask just once more."
"Uu...?"
"...Yesterday, you were given a letter in the rose garden.
 ......Who gave it to you...?!"
"Uu.
 ...Like I said, {f:5:Beatrice}.
 ...You still don\'t believe.
 Uu."
Maria only repeated what she had already said.
......Maria had met with the 19th person, the witch.
Had that really been a 19th person, or had that been one of the 18, who told her to say otherwise?
All that\'s certain is that Maria has been with the rest of us constantly, has always had an alibi, and hasn\'t done anything that would put her under suspicion.
......She\'s simply overjoyed at being made {f:5:Beatrice}\'s messenger, and certainly is not our 19th person.
 ..................I think.
That\'s right,
 I wonder what\'s written in the letter we picked up in Auntie Eva and Uncle Hideyoshi\'s room...
 Aunt Natsuhi should still have it with her...
