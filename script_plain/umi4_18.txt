"Amakusa, could you turn that off?"
"Whoops, my bad.
 You don\'t like M. Zakky?"
"I\'m just not in the mood."
Amakusa turned the radio off.
The world of cheery sounds was immediately swallowed up by the roar of the sea,
 and blotted out by the ocean\'s gray......
".........See it?
 Over there\'s where the harbor was at the time."
".............................."
The boat captain pointed, but I couldn\'t really recall how it looked twelve years ago.
......I had believed that my memories of back then would come flooding back into my mind,
 ...but no memories were coming back to me at all.
After the incident, the island was sealed off and left to the wild.
......Probably that\'s understandable, I had to tell myself, to stop myself from feeling somehow...sad and hurt.
.........Ah, but I at least remember one thing.
You could say that it would probably be the same anywhere on the sea, ......but at least this one thing, I do remember.
The cries...
of the seagulls.
 I do remember those.
......I almost never went to the ocean when I was young.
...So, to me, everything that symbolized the ocean meant Rokkenjima, and my family getting together.
In short, ......it was a symbol for the happiness of going out with my family.
However, at this point in time, it even seems doubtful whether that was happiness at all.
In my younger days, the trip had felt like a relaxed family vacation, but considering my parents\' situation at the time,
 it was surely a very difficult trip to handle, with the distribution of the inheritance filling the place with the smell of flaring tempers and fuses about to blow.
I can remember giggling all over the place, completely ignorant of my parents\' feelings...
"Rokkenjima, ......is it.
 The beginning of everything, and the last stop for all journeys."
Amakusa tried too hard in an attempt to speak for my innermost feelings.
The boat slowly rounded the island.
 ......As the angle changed, I hoped that my memories of the island\'s silhouette at the time might come back just a little,
 but in the end, even as the inlet was completely hidden by the cliffs, I wasn\'t able to remember anything...
"......Captain, that thing you mentioned...
about the other harbor...please tell me about it."
"Mmhm.
 .........They say Rokkenjima\'s only got one harbor.
 But that\'s only its outward appearance."
"An extra hidden harbor on the back of the island.
 .........That\'s Rokkenjima all over.
 It has a second face, which no one knows about..."
"............Rokkenjima is an island in the possession of the Ushiromiya family.
 But it has another face, as an island owned by Kinzo‐san personally......"
"One island, two harbors, two mansions, ......is it.
 He sure spent a lot just so he could keep a mistress."
"Who knew about this other harbor...?"
"Not many.
 Kinzo‐san, Genji‐san the butler.
 Those of us involved with the boats,
 and a very small number of the oldest servants.
 ......The last owner of the Nanjo clinic and that Kumasawa baa‐san knew as well.
 Naming \'em off like this makes it sound like there were a bunch of \'em, but I tell you now, it was only a very small number who knew."
"Please...tell me about that other mansion."
"......All\'s I was told is there\'s a mansion called Kuwadorian.
 Wasn\'t allowed to leave the boat, so I never once saw the place, though."
"So it was far away enough that you couldn\'t see it from the harbor?"
"Beats me.
 ......But it was a hidden mansion after all.
 Probably was built where you can\'t see it from the outside.
 ...Anyway, Kuwadorian was that island\'s biggest secret."
"There\'s a theory that BEATRICE was being made to live in Kuwadorian,
 or else was being confined there... What do you think, Captain?"
"......I carried over sundries meant for Kuwadorian, too.
 Oftentimes that included stuff only women would use, and fancy stuff at that.
 ......No doubt in my mind, that theory is true."
"So does that mean you never saw this BEATRICE woman directly, Captain?"
"Never.
 Came and went for close to twenty years, and never saw her once."
"Twenty years...!
 Whew, so that\'s at least plus twenty onto her age.
 Well, that shoots down my hopes for a mademoiselle."
"But one day, bang, all trips to and from Kuwadorian stopped.
 That was about thirty years ago,
 ......so around 1968, I think."
"Bang?
 You mean suddenly?"
"......We\'d come by the back on a specified schedule to carry food and trash one way or the other.
 ......Uh, when I say the back, I mean the harbor on the Kuwadorian side."
"I get it.
 ...So then?"
"So one day, I get a sudden message from Genji‐san.
 And he tells me, until you hear differently, we don\'t need you to go to the back anymore."
"And did you hear differently?"
"Not in particular.
 To cut a long story short, one day, suddenly, I was told they didn\'t need regular service at the back anymore, and not to bother taking food there either.
 ......Thought I\'d been given the boot at first."
"But it wasn\'t long before I realized.
 ......And I kind of got the picture from the reactions of the servants who knew of Kuwadorian, as well."
".........BEATRICE died, and there was no longer any need to take food or people to care for her?"
"That\'s what I think.
 I\'ve never been told to take another boat to the back since.
 But after that, Genji‐san came to see me face to face,
 and got real pushy, demanding me to take everything about "the back" with me to the grave."
"So, if that hidden mansion was abandoned for twenty whole years,
 .........why was Aunt Eva there?"
On that day twelve years ago...
......Ushiromiya Eva somehow escaped harm alone in a hidden mansion two kilometers away from the regular mansion.
Why was she in a hidden mansion that had been forgotten for twenty years.........?
"I saw that on the talk shows.
 Even I can\'t make heads or tails of that.
 Not once did I show Eva‐san to the back.
 I don\'t have the first damn clue how she knew about Kuwadorian or how she got there."
"I wonder if it was possible to go to the back where Kuwadorian is by land."
"......If, as we heard, the forest was dense and uncultivated,
 I seriously doubt a well‐dressed lady person\'d be able to push through it."
"So what about by sea?
 Maybe there was a motorboat or something."
"Are you kidding?
 That two‐nighter typhoon was awful.
 No way you could\'a used a boat."
"What if there was......an underground passage or something between the mansion and Kuwadorian.
 It would have been a pain to have to charter a boat each time he wanted to visit his mistress\'s house, right...?"
"A tunnel long enough to connect mansions on opposite sides of a two‐kilometer island like Rokkenjima...?"
"...Well, I\'d like to laugh at the thought, but this is a guy so rich he made a whole hidden mansion for his mistress.
 Guess I can\'t deny the possibility.
 ......What do you think, Captain?"
"I\'m a man of the sea.
 No good asking me about holes.
 But the Japanese military dug a twenty‐five‐kilometer tunnel on Iwo Jima.
 Wouldn\'t surprise me one bit if the Kinzo‐san could dig at least two."
".....................This really is a strange island.
 Even now, not one of us really knows a thing about it."
The boat reached the shore.
 There would be a short walk to reach the mansion.
"......I\'ll wait here.
 The mansion\'s that way.
 The path from back then\'s probably still there, but I\'ll bet it\'s covered with plants.
 Make sure you don\'t get yourself lost."
"Right, off we go, then?"
"Thanks, Amakusa.
 But you wait here too."
".........Eh, I had a feeling you\'d say that."
"I\'m just delivering something.
 You\'ll just be trouble for them if you\'re with me.
 I imagine your toxin is strong."
"Toxin?
 Hmm."
"I\'ll be back soon.
 Our main goal today is Kuwadorian.
 ......After I deliver this, I\'ll come right back."
Ange put on her knapsack and grabbed the flowers she was planning to offer.
"Take the hint, young\'un.
 ......Go on, gal.
 Your family\'s waiting for you."
I had never been on a road like this, but I had no trouble finding my way.
If I walked straight ahead, it would probably guide me to the final destination for everything.
The vegetation certainly was incredible, and you would lose track of the path if you were careless enough to let your attention drift.
......But the road that was left was much better than I had imagined.
Still, that didn\'t change the fact that it was a bad road.
......Contrary to the distance shown on the map, I was forced to walk a long way......
......The forest was deep and dark.
At the time, I had been threatened into staying away from the forest because a witch lived there.
Of course, that fear is gone now, .........but I feel it.
Other people may not be able to,
 ......but I can feel the presence, like an aura, of the Golden Witch BEATRICE...
Massive, oddly shaped rocks scattered here and there. Overgrown trees and ivy.
 ......The voices of birds and bugs.
Yeah, I can feel it.
 .........I can feel...that the witch...is here......
Ahead, an ivy‐covered construction site fence and warning sign stood.
"NO ENTRY — TOKYO METROPOLIS".
 That was written on it.
Oh, right.
 When you think "Tokyo", you tend to think of a city,
 but address‐wise, even Rokkenjima is a rightful part of Tokyo Metropolis.
......Apologizing to the sign for my mistaken impression, I climbed over the fence.
When I made it up the steep slope beyond that, ............my field of vision rapidly expanded,
 and a fresh sea breeze blew through my hair......
It was like the top of a little hill.
......Below me was a vast view of the island.
I could only see desolated forest and rocky crags spread out below me.
 ......But, somehow, I realized that the mansion was probably somewhere around there.
The steep downward slope beyond this hill had probably been caused by landslides from twelve years of wind and rain.
It had become a slant filled with crags that you might even call gentle cliffs,
 and though it would be easy to tumble down, it looked like climbing back would be pretty difficult.
.........It seemed that proceeding any further would be impossible.
If I continued any further, I wouldn\'t be able to return.
In other words, .........this is...the border.
Between 1986 and 1998.
 That day and today.
And this world and the other.
"............This is...
...this journey\'s...final destination, it seems."
As the strong wind blew Mammon and Sakutaro\'s hair, they looked down from the hilltop...
"......I can\'t make out a thing from here.
 Where\'s the mansion?
 Let\'s get closer."
‘Uryu, ...we can\'t.
 We won\'t be able to come back.’
......We won\'t be able to...come back...
huh.
He\'s right.
 ......This is 1998,
 ......and I am the Ushiromiya Ange who has been left all alone.
At first, it was a journey to die.
 But not anymore.
It has become a journey to accomplish something......
"Yeah.
 ......So, I\'m sorry, you two.
 As I was back then, on that day, I would have gone down this cliff without any hesitation."
"Come on, this is pretty lame for the skyscraper‐jumping Ushiromiya Ange."
"Sorry."
‘This place is just as good.
 .........Because you can feel the wind of that day.’
"..................
 ......Was the wind...really like this?"
‘Yeah.
 They will come any moment.
 ..................Everyone.’
Sakutaro said it as though it was completely natural.
......And...I believed it.
Mom.
 Dad.
 Onii‐chan.
All of my relatives, and those fun servants.
And............Maria onee‐chan.
"It\'s me.
 ......It\'s Ange.
 ...............I\'ve...come back."
When I started my final journey to expose the past of twelve years ago, its goal had been abstract, and I hadn\'t understood.
But now, ......I have no doubts.
This journey............was induced by all kinds of thoughts and fates over twelve years.
A journey to end things...for me, Ushiromiya Ange.
And a journey to end things...as the final witch of Mariage Sorcière.
I came here as the final daughter of the Ushiromiya family,
 and as the final witch......
"......Mom, Dad, Onii‐chan.
 ...Sorry.
 Let me greet Maria onee‐chan first."
A strong gust of wind from behind urged me on.
That gust took just my soul out from inside my body, ......to the vast forest beneath me.
And, though I couldn\'t see it from where I stood, I believed that it would fly me to the mansion on that day,
 to where everyone was...to where Maria onee‐chan was.
And so,
 ......even though my body was on the top of the hill, a strong wind blowing against me,
 .........my soul was now certainly dancing through that sky......
The vast, vast sky of Rokkenjima.
......Below me was the green of many trees.
But...I can tell.
 I can comprehend the presences of my family and relatives, and all the servants.
 .........And...Maria onee‐chan too.
I could even comprehend......Maria onee‐chan as a witch.
It was vast, more vast than any space I had imagined up until now.
".........Maria onee‐chan.
 Can you hear me......?
 Listen......!!"
Ange shouted to the Maria of that day.
That she had been through a long journey.
And that she had learned just how much she had wounded Maria on that day when she was young.
Having understood magic, I now understand everything about the world Maria wanted to show me.
It is so warm, and overflowing with kindness and happiness.
......She had wanted to become even happier by sharing that world,
 but I had trampled it.
"So now, I finally understand everything.
 ......I understand...magic...!
 Our magic is surely a very humble thing that exists all around us.
 ......But it isn\'t something that just anyone can see with their eyes.
 ............Magic is...
...yes, I can say it clearly."
——Without love, it cannot be ‘seen’.
I\'m sorry, Onee‐chan.
......I\'ve already been excommunicated from the witches\' alliance, but...
...after all this time, I now understand how wonderful it is.
And.........I know that after that day I wounded you, Mariage Sorcière was...
...transfigured into something different from what you truly desired.
.........Back in those days, even magic that allowed you to vent your anger by cursing people was probably important to you.
Your environment was unhappy enough for you to be allowed that.
"But...
......now, those unhappy days...are over.
 ......So,
 ......let\'s return your witches\' alliance...
.........back to the original, gentle Mariage Sorcière."
The grimoire was in my hands without me realizing it.
......The strong winds were rapidly blowing its pages one after another......
It had been a kind world at first.
What to do to create magic so that candy rains from the sky.
What to do to create magic so that tomorrow\'s dinner becomes cream croquettes.
What to do to create magic so that tomorrow\'s weather is good when you go out, and you have a fun day.
New magics of happiness were created one after another, coloring her world with kindness...
Those days were flipped through one after another,
 .........and the days and months began to flash by like memories...
The pages with drawings that were colorful...
gradually changed into pages colored only with black ink......
......Eerie magic circles, and demon summonings.
Evil magic for harming people.
What to do to create magic so that the class bully catches a cold.
What to do to create magic so that you‐know‐who in class gets seriously injured and dies.
What to do to create magic so that a bus with all the bullies on it falls off a cliff.
Malicious magics were created one after another,
 ......filling the pages and her heart...
"It was because I hurt you, Onee‐chan...
that Mariage Sorcière ended up like this.
 .........You aren\'t a black, evil witch.
 ......You were a white, ......pure, innocent,
 ......kind witch......"
"......I\'ll...return you to how you were.
 Originally, when you were scattering magic to make people happy across the entire world.
 ......I\'ll turn you back into that Maria onee‐chan."
"......That is the reason I came here.
 I was guided by fate.
 ............Onee‐chan, can you hear me......?
 Show yourself.........before me.........!!"
That voice rode an even stronger wind, and was sent twelve years into the past......
Then,
 ......the wind gradually ceased,
 .........and silence fell......
Crunch, crunch.
 ......I could hear the sound of gravel being stepped on.
I heard those footsteps, and was surprised at that miracle.
......Without a doubt, those footsteps were Maria onee‐chan\'s.
"............Ma‐......Maria onee‐chan........."
"Kasumi.
 ......Looks like I finally found you, eh, Ange‐chan.........?"
"........................"
......Before I knew it, Aunt Kasumi and her black‐suits, a total of seven people who didn\'t resemble Maria onee‐chan in the slightest,
 were standing there, surrounding me.
And it felt like my voice had been just about to reach Maria onee‐chan, too......
...Because of these guys\' toxin, .........the magic got interrupted...
Ange clicked her tongue at that, but Kasumi probably didn\'t hear it that way.
"............Oh?
 Are those flowers for your deceased family?
 ......How admirable.
 You\'re going to throw them, right?
 That\'s alright, we\'ll wait that long."
......Before what.
...Ange could more or less guess.
The way the black‐suits had their hands unnaturally stuck into their pockets made me realize that they were obviously in possession of handguns.
.........This is a deserted island.
There could be no more convenient place to dispose of someone.
I have absolutely no interest in the family matters of the Sumadera family.
...But if I die, all of that wealth will roll right into the Sumadera family coffers.
Unlike me, they probably have a great deal of interest in it.
Of course, the Ushiromiya Group has a stake in this, too—it seems that if the massive amounts of stock I own suddenly go to the Sumaderas,
 it\'ll be pretty bad for the Ushiromiya Group as well,
 and so they\'ve apparently gotten themselves embroiled in a secret feud over me.
......That\'s probably why President Okonogi gave me Amakusa as a guard.
............Having Amakusa wait on the boat was a regretful mistake...
"How long have you been waiting here in ambush......?"
"Since early morning.
 And I was getting thoroughly tired of waiting for you.
 There are no cafés or powder rooms here, you see."
"No toilets either, so I guess you had to elegantly drop a load behind a tree.
 .........ack—"
"One who, in spite of herself, is a lady with half Sumadera blood flowing through her veins will not use such filthy words.
 .........You really are Sumadera Kyrie\'s child, aren\'t you?
 Not a trace of grace."
She grabbed me by the hair and forced my face up to hers.
And then spat in it.
......My words are filthy, but her spit\'s not to be outdone.
".........Every time you talk about me, it\'s always with reference to Mom.
 ...Am I really that much like my mother?"
"Yes, you are.
 ...............That impertinent gaze.
 Your mouth and nose are the same too."
"......Unrestrained and irresponsible.
 ......She thought nothing of the long history and tradition of the Sumadera family, and selfishly flew out of the house.
 My entire life has been wiping up the messes she left behind...!"
"I guess that makes your life one giant pile of shit."
I was slapped on the cheek, my ear took a heavy hit, and for an instant, my head rang...
.........She pulled me around by the hair, and threw me onto the ground.
And without a moment\'s pause, she kicked the ground, covering me in sand.
"Yes, you truly have become so very like Nee‐san.
 That gaze!
 That gaze like you\'re somehow making fun of me.
 Yes, it\'s all coming back, all of it!"
".........You are pitiful.
 I imagine that since you were young, you were always compared against Mom and looked down upon.
 ......And for the entire rest of your life, you\'ll never be released from that misery."
"A little brat like you couldn\'t possibly understand.
 ......Your mother, you see, is a loser who threw away everything and ran away from the Sumadera family.
 Do you know how much...
how much trouble I went through because of that loser?!!"
"Any trouble you went through has nothing to do with me.
 Can\'t really do anything about what happened before I was born."
".........When is your life going to begin?
 ......It\'s never going to happen.
 You will continue to be sneered at by my dead mother, for ever and ever for all eternity until you die.
 ......In fact, why don\'t you die?
 Why are you alive?"
"You little insolent pissant...!!
 Men...!
 Make her some tea."
"Heheheh...
 Leave it to us..."
"You big‐mouthed shitty brat.
 Let us teach you a little lesson."
The black‐suits dashed up to me, violently grabbed me by the collar, and dragged me down.
"Do as you like until I finish this smoke.
 Teach my darling niece a little of her place."
Sumadera Kasumi.
 She was a pitiable person, to think of it.
To the outside world, the women of the Sumadera family were trained to be in a position to support and defer to the men in the prominent positions.
......But in actuality, strong leadership was demanded of them so that they could manage all of the people under them.
The role demanded of them was that of a female commander.
Taking charge of the Sumadera family with all its proud history required an extraordinary level of commanding presence.
It was an unimaginably heavy responsibility.
Normally, this would have been demanded of Kyrie.
Kyrie had undergone that harsh training.
And Kasumi, as the younger sister, should have been able to just take it easy.
No, in fact, she had lived like a lazy, selfish, and affluent princess, sneering at Kyrie, who had been given the heavy responsibility.
......However,
 Kyrie was suddenly disinherited.
She had refused the fiancé her parents had arranged, and had gotten pregnant by her lover, Ushiromiya Rudolf.
From the Sumadera family\'s perspective, even though the Ushiromiya family held a vast fortune, it was a family which had already collapsed, a family not in their league.
And to become not even a legal wife, but a lover to the second son of that family...
Normally, no one would be shown mercy for something so dishonorable, not even a daughter of the main family.
They would wrap her up in a mat, stand a pole on end,
 and throw her either into the Pacific Ocean if the pole fell to the right or the Sea of Japan if it fell to the left.
.........But Kyrie\'s punishment was nothing but disinheritance, an unbelievably lenient decision.
After that, the Sumadera family began receiving preferential treatment from a section of the Ushiromiya Group.
 ......There must have been some kind of backroom deal.
In other words, Kyrie took advantage of the Ushiromiya family\'s financial support to leave the Sumadera family openly.
Kasumi watched it happen in shock.
No, she even disparaged her dishonorable sister as a loser.
......But eventually...
...she learned that the heavy responsibilities Kyrie had borne would be passed on to her,
 and then, for the first time, she realized that she had been outwitted......
"Because of your mother, my life was turned into a mess.
 ......No, you could even say she killed me once.
 On that day, I was killed once and cast down into a hellish life..."
".........Isn\'t that just what you get for thinking you can breeze through life?
 ......gyack!
 .........*cough*, *cough*......"
"This girl doesn\'t know when to shut up!
 Oorrrrah!"
The black‐suit punched me in the gut, and I doubled over.
But I was quickly grabbed by the collar and made to stand up again.
As she continued to cold‐heartedly look down upon Ange, Kasumi blew out smoke......
The hard days after Kyrie left were floating through her mind.
Until then, she had been allowed to be simply a rich young lady, unrestrained and unaffected.
......Only Kyrie, the older sister, had been strictly trained, and she, the younger sister, had been able to live as nothing more than a princess.
Then, suddenly, everything was turned over to such a degree that her life tumbled and crashed......
"My life, lifestyle, way of living, ......everything was stolen from me.
 .........Do you know how much I was maligned based on my sister\'s dishonor by those relatives who didn\'t know the details...?
 ......I detested her.
 I detested your mother enough to make me spit blood..."
"Glad to hear it.
 I hope it continues for many years to come.
 .........gagghh!!"
A kick landed in Ange\'s side as she lay prostrate on the ground.
Ange didn\'t stand up again.
......So she continued to lie there like a caterpillar, getting kicked every time she spoke up.
"......I saw Nee‐san at an Ushiromiya Group party once.
 ......She was with her husband,
 .........looking very happy,
 ......and laughing.
 ......She...
...pushed everything onto me,
 ......and found happiness...
......only for herself........."
".........So what?
 How is taking it out on me going to make you happy?
 Is taking it out on me going to turn back time and change history for you or something?"
".........Ugugggh,
 .........gah,
 .........*cough*......!!"
"You said something a short while ago...
 When is my life going to begin?
 .........No matter how much I despise you or take it out on you, I cannot turn back time.
 ......So am I doomed to keep on hating Nee‐san like this for the rest of my life, even though she\'s dead?"
"Not if I can help it.
 ......How long must I be tormented by Nee‐san\'s ghost?
 And so I thought.
 .........If I could pull this off, I would be able to forget all of my hatred and start over."
Ange was about to respond to this with another bitter comment, but stopped.
...Because she would be kicked again if she responded.
......Even if Kasumi didn\'t say any more, it wasn\'t difficult to imagine what she meant.
Kasumi was thinking of bringing an end to her hatred of Kyrie by taking revenge against her daughter, Ange.
.........Talk about pushing your problems on other people.
"Come on, stand up.
 If you like this island that much, I\'ll bury you here deep.
 .........You don\'t want to die at your age, right?
 Don\'t you want to say "Sorry my mother caused you so much trouble", or something?"
".........You...
...wish.
 .........gkkhhh,
 .........glk, ......!!"
‘Uryuu!!
 Ange, Angeeeeee...!!’
"Ange‐sama, no...!
 You mustn\'t provoke these guys...!!
 You should at least make it seem like you\'re going along with them, so you can buy some time...!"
".........They do say...
that you should throw your foolish pride...
out with the garbage......"
‘Wh‐what about Amakusa‐san...?!
 If Amakusa‐san comes, I just know he\'ll......!’
"......No, it\'s no good, I can\'t see him...
 ......You idiot, Ange‐sama...!
 Why did you come without Amakusa...!"
I don\'t need you to tell me that, Mammon.
......I\'m already right in the middle of regretting it.
I walked a long way to get here.
 The forest was very thick.
......There\'s no way that the disturbance here will reach the boat......
As Kasumi took her sweet time smoking that single cigarette down to the filter,
 I was continuously laid into by the black‐suits however they deemed fit.
The moment I grabbed my head to protect it, the top of my head was kicked by someone at a bad angle, and my head filled with stars......
This feeling of stars flickering in a world twisted with gray...
...was one I knew well.
My life was very similar to the one Sumadera Kasumi led.
...Because I was tormented constantly with all kinds of bullying under the guise of education and training, to make me a worthy "successor to the Ushiromiya family".
Yes.
 Having the inside of my head filled with stars like this...is a feeling I know well.
When being reprimanded for some error in manners I seemed to have made,
 the lecture always turned to whether I was fitting to be the successor to the Ushiromiya family or not.
......On and on about the honor of the Ushiromiya family, and how important it was.
......By the time her rant reached that point,
 I would forget what mistake I was being blamed for in the first place.
No, actually, it was the same way for Aunt Eva too.
After all, sometimes she would ask herself "Umm, what was I saying again?"
...But in the end, she wouldn\'t be able to remember, and would say something like:
"The fact that I\'m angry must mean that you did something wrong.
 So whatever wrong thing you did is the problem, and it isn\'t important that I can\'t remember what it was any more."
...There\'d be some ridiculous reasoning like that, and then she would continue punishing me.
Yes.
 Aunt Eva\'s punishments weren\'t something that would continue until I learned something, or acknowledged my mistake, or apologized.
.........They would continue until Aunt Eva wanted to stop.
So even this violence was a bit nostalgic, in a way that made me want to vomit.
......I opened my eyes, ......and oh look, there\'s Aunt Eva.
Right next to Kasumi, who was smoking her cigarette,
 I could see Aunt Eva, the two of them looking almost as though they were laughing at me together.
When I think about it, even Aunt Eva\'s life might be worthy of sympathy.
......The responsibilities and pressures of members of the Ushiromiya family, which she had so often mentioned to me,
 were all things that she herself had suffered.
Because people cannot voice insults that they have never been subjected to themselves......
It was probably the same way for Aunt Rosa as well.
......As the youngest child of the glorious Ushiromiya family, she must have gone through many tough times.
So, just as Aunt Eva acted towards me...
And just as Sumadera Kasumi is acting right now...
......Aunt Rosa must also...have been the same.
People push the suffering they have been made to bear onto other people.
Otherwise, they can never escape from it.
......So on and on, in eternity and perpetuity, the chain of suffering and sadness never ends.
That is the reason............Maria onee‐chan\'s magic was...
...so incredible.
With her magic, ......she did not have to bear the suffering from Aunt Rosa.
That pain was probably pushed onto her.
Its weight probably tormented her.
......But Onee‐chan did not carry that burden on her own shoulders.
.........She exorcised it...and filled her world with happiness.
So, I\'m sure...
...that even if Maria onee‐chan had had children in the future...
...she would never have pushed the suffering forced down through the generations onto them.
......The chain of suffering and sadness,
 which had been inherited by and forced upon each generation for who knows how long,
 .........was, by Maria onee‐chan\'s magic, broken.
"............What is it?
 Do you have something to complain to me about?"
In the past, I would have snapped back.
......And cancelled out her hatred with hatred of my own.
...No, I cancelled out nothing.
 The weight of that which had been forced onto her bears down hard on my shoulders as well.
After all, even now, ......I hate her.
So,
 ............now that I knew of magic,
 ......I looked at the human called Ushiromiya Eva again.
.........What I could see through to...
...was the sad form of a human, no different from me, who had lost her family and who bore deep wounds in her heart.
Unable to withstand the pain of that torn heart,
 she was doing nothing except howling with a sad voice—like a lion crying in pain—like a child.
......It turns out...Ushiromiya Eva was also a person deserving of compassion.
She had needed someone to understand the difficulties and pain of her childhood days,
 .........and she, too, as the only survivor of the Rokkenjima incident,
 who was faced with the inquisitive eyes of all of society, who was publicly slandered, who had salt continually rubbed into her wounds,
 ......had needed someone\'s compassion.
In order to let her forget her pain and sorrow for least a moment,
 ............the black witch, the very same that possessed Aunt Rosa, ......taught her magic.
It was the same magic of anger and sadness that BEATRICE had taught Maria onee‐chan,
 when she was mourning for Sakutarou after he was torn apart.
......That same magic, that witch, had surely dwelled inside Aunt Rosa too.
............So I was wrong to hate Ushiromiya Eva.
...Perhaps...
......I alone was supposed to have become her ally,
 the only person in the world who could understand her.
......What did I say to her when I was young, when she returned alive all alone...?
Could it be...
......that the way I acted towards her was...
......as if she had come back by herself after killing all my family......?
...........................
 ......I can\'t believe it.
...Aunt Eva, who throughout my life has never been more than an object of and synonym for hatred,
 .........is turning into a...human who I can understand......
And so.
 .........I looked right next to Aunt Eva, ......at the form of the black witch who taught her the black magic......
Aunt Eva...was crying.
It was only natural.
.........Not only did she have no one who would understand her pain of having lost her husband and son all at once,
 ......but even I, her only relative, insulted her, ......saying "Give me back my mom and dad".
.........I can make the excuse that it was the mercilessness of youth.
...But......to her at the time,
 that was probably cruel enough to sever her heart\'s last thread.
..................In the following days, the talk shows and magazines publicly slandered her.
The truths of her late husband\'s business and character, and even those about her beloved son, were denied.
She no longer had anything left.
She could do nothing but cry and howl, ......trying to forget the pain and sadness for just a few moments.
Because only while howling could she feel the slightest bit of release.
And so, .........the black witch taught her how to howl.
The one I hated...was the black witch.
 The black magic probably did release her from that suffering for just a short time.
......However,
 it would never lift that weight from her shoulders.
To the contrary, it would force that weight on further victims,
 .........filling the world with the weight of hatred.
...............If Aunt Eva was to have a true witch nearby, one who knew of white magic...
......wasn\'t that...
.........supposed to be...
...me.........?
I had learned the magic to create happiness from Maria onee‐chan.
.........If I could have saved her......with that magic,
 ...............might we not have...
......built up a future with a completely different relationship?
All this time,
 .........I have hated Aunt Eva.
...So I never noticed the black witch beside her.
......Without love, it couldn\'t be ‘seen’.
I didn\'t have...
...any love for her......
So now, finally...
.........I\'ll glare at the black witch,
 ......the one I truly should hate.
"......Oh?
 .........What\'s thiiis?
 You can ‘see’ me?
 Ehheheheheh...!"
"..................Yes, I can.
 ......The one I should\'ve hated wasn\'t Aunt Eva.
 ......It was you."
"Hey, you\'re pretty good.
 To think that a lowly Human could ‘see’ a witch like me.
 ......And so?
 Are you trying to say something with that glare?
 Do you hate me?"
"...............Hate?
 ......Yes, I do.
 ......But...that\'s not quite it.
 ......I just...find you a little sad."
"Sad?
 
......*giggle*giggle*, ahhahahahahaha!
 What\'re you saying, come on, you can get mad!
 Why don\'t you just hate me with all your strength forever?!"
"......I won\'t hate.
 ......Hating you...
......means I\'m doing nothing more than inheriting Aunt Eva\'s hatred.
 ......I\'ll break the hatred.
 ......I\'ll accept Aunt Eva\'s suffering, .........exorcise it, and throw it away."
"Ahhahahahahahahaha!!
 What kind of epiphany do you think you\'ve had?
 Is your head alright?
 I mean, why don\'t you just give up and die foreveeeer?!"
"Kyaahhahhahahahahahaha!
 You guys, kick her more and more, okay?
 Not her face, though.
 It wouldn\'t do any good kicking her pitiful face only to make it better!"
"Guhhkk!
 .........*cough*!!
 ...............g\'......"
The black‐suits persistently kicked my stomach and back.
......As though they had been ordered to by the black witch.
"......Dear me, still nothing to you, is it......?
 ............You keep staring right at me.
 You hate me?
 I\'ll bet you do.
 I hate you too.
 *snicker*snicker*snicker*......"
Kasumi sneered at me.
 ......But for some reason, I had the feeling that she was crying behind that expression.
She\'s had a life just as unfair as mine forced upon her, and the pain of that never, ever heals.
......The sad lion continues to howl, gasping in pain from the thorn he can\'t get out...
"Hey, Sumadera Kasumi, take a look.
 That over there is what you used to be."
"......Doesn\'t that make you feel so much better?
 You used to be standing there, but now you\'re on this side, you know that?
 Eheheheh, isn\'t it delightful?
 Now the shoe is on the other foot!"
"...............Yes, it truly does feel...
......delightful.........
 Ahhahahahaha, how can you make that kind of face, Ange...?!
 Go on and cry, you want to, right?!"
"Kyahhahahahahahaha!!
 Yes, yes, of course she wants to cry!
 Go on, make her cry."
"You were made to cry back then, weren\'t you?
 So make her cry too.
 *giggle*, and Ange, it\'s alright, okay?
 Why not cry foreveeeeeeeer?!
 Kyaaaha‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah!!"
"...Aha, ...ahahahahahahaha!!
 Cry, Angeee!
 I want to see your crying face!
 Cry, and try saying "I\'m sorry, Aunt Kasumi"...!!"
"Yes, make her say those words.
 ......Those words hurt, right?
 Being made to apologize for something that isn\'t your fault......hurt a lot, didn\'t it......?"
"Make her go through the same thing...
 By doing that, you can relieve your pain."
"......Ehheheheh, yes, that\'s the way.
 Be more honest with yourself.
 Why not spit out your emotions more and more and more foreveeeeeeeer?!"
......The black witch stirred Kasumi up.
And Kasumi began to give herself over to that dark emotion.
......She was doing nothing more than turning her deep sadness into cheap booze and forcing it down,
 trying to forget for just a brief moment.
The words Kasumi insulted me with...
......were themselves...
...sad.
And...I couldn\'t forgive the black witch for taking advantage of Kasumi\'s sadness.........
.........I had gone limp on the ground, which seemed to have sapped the black‐suits of their enthusiasm for kicking.
...Or maybe the kickers had finally gotten tired too.
Kasumi hadn\'t ordered them to stop, but at some point, the violence had halted.
However, I was reflected in Kasumi\'s eyes, and they were burning me with flames of hatred.
......She had been tempted by the witch into doing that in order to relieve her own pain.
".........Sumadera Kasumi.
 You aren\'t done.
 You\'ve got much more trampling to do.
 Can you forgive what happened to your entire life with just this little bit of violence?"
"...I can\'t forgive what happened.
 ......It\'ll take a lot more than this for me to forgive that."
"Right?
 There\'s no way you can forgive!
 Do it more!
 More of the flames of hatred!
 Nothing can warm you except the flames of hate.
 You are freezing in the snow fields of anger and sadness, and the only flame that can warm you up is hatred...!!"
"Come on, say it!
 Scream it!!
 Why don\'t you burn yourself to ashes with a roar of hate foreveeeeeeer?!"
"U‐......USHIROMIYA ANGEEEEEEEEE!!
 Loathing you......is what allows me to draw breath!!
 Ehhehehehahhahahahahahahahahahaha!!"
"Sumadera Kasumi, that bouquet of flowers.
 .........These flowers are for your dead family, right, Ange?"
The black witch grinned at me unpleasantly, and used her chin to signal Kasumi to pick them up.
Kasumi picked up the flowers I was going to offer,
 .........brought them all the way over to me, dropped them in front of me, and made a show of trampling them...
Her expression was filled with hatred, ......and a frantic quality that simple hatred couldn\'t explain.
...It was as if trampling them over and over again was the only way to prevent the sadness inside her from reaching the bursting point.
So the sound of her trampling was downright sad.
".........Oh, this isn\'t enough to get to you?
 Then what about this?
 Sumadera Kasumi!
 Use this one."
"......N‐.........no......
 ...Not that........."
The object the black witch pointed at.........was Maria onee‐chan\'s grimoire.
Kasumi also noticed it, and picked up that book, which was heavier than it looked...
"What\'s thiiis?"
"*giggle*.
 ......Why not read it and laugh forever?
 Eheheh, you might split your sides laughing..."
Kasumi opened the grimoire,
 ......skimmed over the contents, and snorted derisively.
"Give it back......
 That\'s......Onee‐chan\'s............"
Of course, my hand couldn\'t reach.
......My stomach was once again kicked by the black‐suits, and I curled up on the ground...
"See?
 See how important this book is to Ange?
 Mock the things that are important to her.
 That works better than punching or kicking for a girl like her.
 ......You know that better than anyone, right...?"
Kasumi\'s face twisted for an instant, as though remembering something painful.
......But that quickly disappeared, changing into a scornful smile directed towards me.
"*giggle*giggle*.
 Wowww, what a freaky book.
 ......Did you write this.........?"
"......Stop it...... Give it back........."
"*giggle*giggle*giggle*, *giggle*giggle*!!
 Look at that face...!
 Mock it more, mock it more...!
 Teach her the pain of having your dignity trampled, that\'s the only way to soften your own pain...!"
"Heh, heheheheh, what\'s with this embarrassing book...
 ............I know some people develop a little interest in make‐believe fortune telling when they\'re young girls."
"But isn\'t this taking it a bit too far?
 Oh god, it says "magic".
 ......You\'re one of those, aren\'t you.
 You know, that thing in cartoons where they say some "blabbity‐blibbity‐woo" spell and transform into a witch.
 You\'re one of those people who like doing that, aren\'t you?
 .........This is just painful.
 *snicker*snicker*."
Cackling, Kasumi opened to a random page and showed it to the black‐suits.
The black‐suits looked too, and guffawed.
That laughter wouldn\'t wound me.
......But I couldn\'t forgive it.
 ...After all, that laughter was ridiculing Maria onee‐chan.
I don\'t hate Kasumi.
 ......For exploiting Kasumi\'s unhealing anger and sadness, ......I cannot forgive the black witch...
That black witch ate into Aunt Eva, Sumadera Kasumi, and Aunt Rosa,
 ......tormenting them for an eternity without letting their wounds be healed.
.........I can\'t forgive her......
......I can\'t forgive.........the black witch......
"Oh my god, this is priceless...!
 ......Magic for making candy rain from the sky, ......it says!!
 Ahhahahahaha...!"
"Let\'s see.
 Dissolve sugar in cold water purified by the sun...?
 Dip the magic wand in, and say the incantation, .........*cackle*cackle*cackle*, ahhahahahahahahahaha!!
 What the hell?!
 Ahhahahahahahahaha...!!
 Criiiiiiiiinge!!"
The black‐suits also rolled around, guffawing.
Then, grinning, the black witch whispered something into Kasumi\'s ear.
......Then, after glaring at me with a grin, ......Kasumi took that page—
"......Ah—"
Kasumi grabbed hold of that page, tore it out, crumpled it up, ......and threw it away......
‘Th‐......that\'s so mean... ......That was...Maria\'s magic.........’
"Oh, really?
 Heheh, how sad."
......It was one of the magics to summon happiness...
...that Maria had made with Sakutarou.
Anyone knows that making sugar water, coloring it with paint, and leaving it by the window...
...isn\'t going to make candy rain from the sky.
But after repeating that every day, ......one time when she got back from school...
...she found several pieces of candy scattered around that place...
.........How happy must that miracle have made Maria onee‐chan.
......What good care she must have taken of those candies, savoring them during her nights all alone with Sakutarou, to distract herself from her loneliness.
That......magic which Onee‐chan had created...
......was torn out, thrown away,
 ...and disappeared......
The entire miracle of happiness created by that magic,
 ......she tore out and threw away......
"Oh, this one\'s another classic...!
 Magic to make dinner be cream croquettes?
 Ahhahahahahaha!!
 ......What\'s this next one?
 Magic to make bell peppers taste nice?
 This is amazing, ridiculous!
 Ah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah...!!"
"Tear that too.
 Eheheh!!
 Why not tear it more and more foreveeeeeer?!?!"
With a cruel‐hearted, loud laugh,
 ......the black witch made her tear out Maria onee‐chan\'s magics one after another......
She...sneered at those happy magics,
 ......ripped them out,
 ......and threw them away......
"Stop it... Stop it......!!
 Don\'t......defile Lady MARIA\'s magic...!!
 Don\'t defile it......with your filthy toxin...!!"
Mammon cried and yelled, ......but she had no way of reaching Kasumi.
"Who cares, why don\'t you just be defiled foreveeeer?!
 Magical miracles?
 Magic to bring happiness?
 Doesn\'t exist, there\'s no such thing!"
"Pain and suffering, you see, can only be healed by pushing them onto someone else.
 ......Now you, you were what they call a "magic friend", right?
 *cackle*cackle*cackle*!
 Sumadera Kasumi, open up to her page."
"What\'s this?
 Magic friends, it says.
 ............The Seven Sisters of Purgatory?"
"Ahah, what a creepy name!
 *giggle*, it says they can fly at awesome speeds, and finish off the enemy for you.
 Ahhaha, Ange, if you can use this kind of magic, shouldn\'t you use it right now?
 .........Ahhahahahaha.
 Stupid!"
The pages that wrote of the Seven Sisters of Purgatory were also heartlessly torn away.
......The pages themselves were just paper.
They weren\'t Mammon\'s vessel or anything.
But the tearing, denying toxin burned Mammon from the inside......
Mammon\'s face twisted from the heat and pain...
".........ghhh, ...............kkkhhh, ........."
‘Are you okay, Mammon?!
 Hang in there......!!’
"......I can......handle it...
 ......It\'s not me......but Ange‐sama.........who\'s in pain........."
However, Mammon\'s expression was twisted in unbearable pain and humiliation......
‘Stop it, black witch......!!
 Why are you doing something like this?!
 Why......can\'t you use magic for happiness?!!’
"......Oh, you\'re a magic friend too, right?
 *giggle*, I\'ll defile you too.
 Sumadera Kasumi, look for this guy\'s page, too."
"What\'s this one?
 What\'s with this crappy scribble of a lion?
 ......Sakutarou?
 What a weird name!
 My best friend, it says.
 Really?
 This is your friend? Your close friend?
 This lion is? Is it, is it?"
"Ahhahahahahahaha!!
 It really is a crappy scribble.
 So this butt‐ugly lion is you."
"To think she had something like this as a friend... That Ushiromiya Maria kid\'s mind is so unbelievably wretched my sides are hurting.
 .........What a morrrrron.
 Why not give up and die foreveeeeeer......?"
‘U...ryu......
 .........Don\'t make fun......of Maria......’
"...............St......op......it.........
 ...Don\'t rip it........."
""No waay.""
There was a shrill tearing sound.
 .........And the page was filthily ripped out...
The picture of Sakutarou...
...that Onee‐chan had drawn...
...was violently ripped in half.........
"What a shhhhhitty drawi~ng.
 Kyahhahahahahahahahahahaha...!"
"You all laugh too.
 Aahhahahahahahahaha...!"
Obeying the pair, the black‐suits laughed crudely,
 ......and heartlessly trampled all over the paper that had been torn and thrown away......
‘Uuuuuuuuuuuu, ......hic!
 ......Uuuuuuuuuuu......’
"......Sakutaro, ......be strong........."
‘I\'m...not sad......
 ...I just......can\'t stand it......
 ......Maria\'s being made fun of,
 .........and I can\'t do anything about it...
 ......I can\'t stand it......’
"........................
 ......To Humans who can\'t ‘see’ us, ......it\'s as though we don\'t exist...
 ......We can only interact with Humans that need us.
 ............That\'s why.........we\'re furniture........."
As Sakutarou and Mammon......supported each other,
 ......they slumped down, ...sobbing...
I couldn\'t stand it either......
 ......Only those who can ‘see’ the world of magic can understand how wonderful it is.
It can\'t be explained to humans who can\'t understand.
 And so it is mocked.
.........If only you could show it...
......But you can\'t......
Because, in front of Humans who are filled with the anti‐magic toxin and who can\'t understand magic,
 .........magic cannot be used......
"I really don\'t get it.
 From this delusional diary, I\'ve got to assume that something\'s wrong with your head.
 ......It really is interesting to take a peek into your happy‐go‐lucky little mind.
 You creepy child."
"You and Maria.
 ......And that stuffed animal and the furniture over there too.
 *giggle*giggle*giggle*!!
 Ahhahahahahahahahahaha!"
"Aah, I could laugh.
 You don\'t have any friends, do you?
 You\'re allllways all alone, and stuffed animals are your friends, right?
 What a pitiable child."
"Ehheheheheheheheheh...!
 Don\'t worry, I understand.
 I know what it\'s like to live that way.
 .........So I\'ll be the one to recognize you for what you are.
 You really are a pitiful little child.
 Ehhehehhahahahahahahaha!"
.........So, to you,
 ......she looks like a pitiful child.
Yes, I\'m sure she does.
If a hundred people were to read Onee‐chan\'s diary and grimoire, all one hundred would probably get that same impression.
......I used to be one of them.
But you know,
 .........in spite of all that,
 ......Maria onee‐chan...
...still called this a world of happiness.
.........Don\'t deny...
......that magic, ...that happiness......
"Such a stubborn child, you are.
 ......Alright, fine.
 This is the last one.
 I\'ll tear apart the source of the absolutely ridiculous magic that you and Maria believed in.
 Sumadera Kasumi, read this page."
"Hmmm, what is this colorful page......?
 ...Let\'s see.
 .........Magic to...
...always be friends with Mama who I love...?"
‘N‐noooooooooo!!
 Not that page......!!’
"Oh?
 This magic is really simple.
 I think even I could do it without any practice at all.
 .........Even I can remember an incantation this short.
 Shall I give it a go?"
"*giggle*giggle*, it really is a short incantation, isn\'t it?
 Alright, give it a try, let\'s all burst it out!"
With expressions that ridiculed it from the bottoms of their hearts, the black witch and Kasumi......puckered their lips in the most exaggerated way they could,
 ............and said it aloud......
"Uu‐uu."
The black‐suits stared blankly, asking what that was supposed to be.
Then Kasumi answered, cackling.
"This is supposed to be the "incantation".
 Are you kidding me...!
 Ahhahahahahahaha...!!!"
"Come on, why don\'t you guys try it too?
 Uu‐uu‐uu."
The black‐suits imitated that moaning voice, making fun of it......
————“Uu‐uu.”
That was the incantation...for the magic that would let her always be friends with the mama she loved.
"What is this stupidity...!!
 If you could make family relationships better just by saying "uu‐uu", we would have world peace forever.
 Ahah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐ha!!"
"Uu‐uu‐uu!
 A stupid moaning voice!
 If you do this over and over again, people are going to think you\'re a poor kid with mental problems!
 Are you retarrrrrded?!
 Waaahahhahahahaha, waaahahahahahaha!!"
‘Stoooooop...... At least don\'t mock......that magiiiiiiiic......’
............One day when Maria onee‐chan and Aunt Rosa had gone on a picnic together.
It was written that this was one of the five happiest days of her life.
And Onee‐chan was singing her mama a song that she had just learned from her.
......Onee‐chan was happy to see that her mama was enjoying it very much.
 But partway through, she forgot the lyrics.
But her mama was enjoying it so much, so she tried to sing until the very end.
With "uu‐uu‐uu".
......She sung it with fake lyrics, but her mama was very pleased......
After that, "uu" remained as an incantation to remember that day she had spent in fun and happiness with her mama.
Of course, even though Aunt Rosa thought it funny at first, eventually she tired of hearing it,
 and later on, started to scold Onee‐chan whenever she said it,
 ......but to Onee‐chan, it was a memory of a fun day that she could never forget......
So among the magics that Maria created, it was the oldest and the first......
Kasumi stuck her fingernails into that page too......
"......Stop,
 ............don\'t tear it......
 At least spare...
......that page........."
"Ehheheheheheheheheh!
 No waay!!"
............With a shrill sound, a girl\'s world of happiness...
was...
erased.
"Uu‐uu‐uu!
 Aaaa‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah, aaaaahah‐hah‐hah‐hah!!
 Is this your magic of happiness?
 Hilarious, hilarious...!!"
"Why would you ever think that magic could make people happy?!
 Magic—listen now—is made of...anger...and hatred!"
"Happiness is what you call the feeling of release you get only when you\'ve pushed all of the hatred you bear onto someone else.
 The happiness you all are talking about is a phantom that doesn\'t show up outside picture books!!"
As Kasumi laughed her head off, she slammed the grimoire against the ground, and stepped on it.
"Can\'t stand it?
 Well? Can\'t stand it?!
 You white witches of happiness?
 If you can\'t stand it that much, why don\'t you show us?!
 Show us your magic!!"
"If it exists, then you just have to use it and show us, riiiiight?
 .........A witch that can\'t use magic isn\'t a witch!!
 So we are the real witches.
 You\'re just brats trying to escape reality with a dream of magic!!"
...............Then,
 .........if I can show you magic, ......will you...
......believe in Onee‐chan\'s magic.........?
"Huh?
 Kyahhahahaha, oh yes, oh yes!!
 I\'ll believe!
 If you can use magic and show me, that i~s!!
 Go on then, do it, you shit‐for‐brains little braaaaaat!!"
...........................
 .........
Silently, slowly,
 ......I stood up.
 ......The sensations of this small world, such as the pain in my body, felt truly insignificant......
"Oh, looks like you\'ve still got enough energy to stand up, Miss Great Witch?
 *snicker*snicker*!"
"Now that you\'ve stood up, what are you going to show us?
 Go on, show us your magiiic...!"
".....................Magic...exists."
"Whaa?
 What\'s this kid coming out with now...?!
 Did you guys hear that?!"
"Quiet!!!
 ............Heh, isn\'t that interesting.
 ...You people have always declined to show this power of miracles because of the anti‐magic toxin.
 .........Disciple of the white witch MARIA.
 Try showing me magic...!!"
"..........................."
"......Do you have any clue how many humans have believed in that miracle and been betrayed?"
".........*giggle*.
 Every one of them believed!
 Every one of them was betrayed and despaired!
 And they all learn that true magic can only be gained by the power of black witches like me...!!"
"...............Taking your hatred out on someone else is nothing more than a crime.
 That isn\'t magic.
 .........I\'ll show you what real magic is."
"...............Y‐you..............."
The black witch winced slightly.
However, Kasumi sneered at me even more.
"Show me, then.
 So? What kind of magic are you going to show me?
 Magic to make candy rain from the sky?
 Or else magic to make cookies multiply?"
"............Wagh?!"
The instant I opened my eyes, a tremendous wind arose.
"Wh‐......what is this, all of a sudden.........?!"
"Come, arise, the Seven Sisters of Purgatory."
".........Whaaat......"
There was a flash behind me, and in an instant, seven high‐level furniture were gathered there.
It was a power that far surpassed the magical power I\'d had in my prime.
It was a power that matched even Maria onee‐chan and BEATRICE.
"The Seven Sisters of Purgatory, right here...!!"
"......A‐Ange‐sama......!"
"You said it once.
 ......Because I lacked magical power and resolve,
 ......I could not use you or your sisters.
 ............This isn\'t some cheap emotion, like wanting to get back at my bullying classmates."
"...In order to protect Maria onee‐chan\'s, .........Mariage Sorcière\'s world,
 ......I now order you to show me the miracle of magic."
"I‐it\'s impossible...
 There\'s just no way, not with such a mass of toxin in front of us........."
The Seven Sisters also remembered what had once happened in that classroom.
......If they could have obeyed Ange\'s order, they would have.
......However, ......surrounded by the toxin that runs thick in Humans, they hadn\'t been able to display the miracle of magic.
......And they remembered very well how deeply that had hurt Ange......
But Ange spoke very quietly.
"In that case.
 You all believe too."
"......Huh?"
"............Mariage Sorcière was created to make people happy.
 ...And also to fight the black witch."
"The foolish black witch denies the world created by one of the founders, the Witch of Origins, Lady MARIA.
 ......In order to show her that miracle,
 ......and in order to protect that world,
 .........believe.
 In magic.
 In witches.
 Right now—in the miracle...!"
Kasumi gave an order to the black‐suits, and one of them took out a gun and pointed it at Ange.
"You\'re going to show us magic, right?
 Then show us, if you would.
 Use magic to shoot this man down with a fireball or lightning or something."
"You get one chance.
 .........Show us before I count to three, alright?
 If you can\'t, then you had best prepare yourself, okay?
 Ehheheheheh!"
"...........................
 ..................Shoot me."
"What\'s with this kid.
 Hehheheh, she\'s fuckin\' crazy."
The black‐suit pointing the gun laughed at Ange\'s composure.
"Ahhahahahahaha!!
 Are you serious?!
 This girl\'s living in cloud cuckoo land!
 In that case, get yourself shot! Why don\'t you just die foreveeeeeeer?!"
‘Ange...!!
 ......I‐it\'s impossible!
 You can\'t block bullets with magic......!!’
"No.
 There\'s nothing to be afraid of.
 ............To my magic, to the Seven Sisters of Purgatory, bullets are like nothing."
"A‐Ange‐sama........."
Mammon was flustered by Ange\'s absolute trust.
......She would have loved to live up to that trust, if only she could.
 On that day as well.
But, ......she had been unable to do anything, and she had hurt Ange.........
"Hehheheh, you little shit.
 You can use magic, huh? Then goddamn show us already."
"What\'s the hold up?
 Show us some magic, right now!!"
"Come on, no need to hold back!
 Shazow!
 Blast me with some magic, I dare ya!!
 Hihhehhehheh!"
The black‐suits jeered at her.
But Ange simply concentrated her mind in silence......
"Why not just shoot and kill her forever?!
 She\'s even telling you to shoot her!"
"......This kid\'s already lost her mind from fear.
 Bye‐bye, Ange‐chan.
 ......Go and play witches as much as you want in heaven.
 ......Shoot her."
"Heheh, you sure?"
"Shoot!
 Die, Ange!!"
"Magic it up, brat, if you can!!!"
The black‐suit cocked the gun, and, sneering, he...pulled the trigger.
"................................."
A gunshot rang out,
 .........and the world...stopped.
A red spray scattered,
 .........and chunks of flesh flew.
"...uh, ...............ah......"
"What are you doing, Mammon?
 ......You would let this boorish pebble of a bullet reach Ange‐sama?"
Lucifer had lined up the bullet perfectly, and with a single swing, ......had sliced it in two......
And......in the chest of the black‐suit who had apparently fired the gun......there was a hole as big as a fist...
".........Every once in a while,
 it\'s alright for me to go first, right?"
Half of Leviathan\'s body was covered with blood, and she wore a cold smile.
......Then, slowly, .........the pitiful prey that she had brought down...fell over.
"Y‐......you pierced...a Human......!!!"
"Idiot!
 Do you still not believe?!
 In our master\'s magic power...!!"
"Are......you...kidding me.........?!?!
 You ma‐manifested...in front of this many Humans?!?!"
"Wh‐.........what the...what?!"
Kasumi and the rest were thrown into confusion...
He certainly seemed to have fired the gun......
However,
 ......it hadn\'t hit Ange,
 .........and why...
...was the person who fired...
...instead......?!
"......This is...magic.
 ......Great job, Leviathan."
"I am most honored...!!
 You foolish Humans who dare oppose our master!
 Now is the time of judgment! Prostrate yourselves!!"
"H‐how......?!!!
 You shouldn\'t be able to bring magic into the world of Humans...!!
 They shouldn\'t be able to ‘see’ magic, they shouldn\'t be able to be touched by magic!!
 ......How?!!"
"............Because this...is true magic."
"...... ......aaaaaaaaaaaaaAAAAA...!!"
"Wh‐what are you people doing?!
 K‐kill her, kill her!!!"
One of the black‐suits who had finally come to his senses pulled his gun, aimed,
"Did you think I\'d overlook the disrespect of pointing a gun at our master......?
 Die."
Those words were his funeral.
 ......The man had already been struck through the chest by Lucifer, who had become the Stake of Pride in an instant.
Thump!
 The sound of the second person falling brought it home to the black‐suits that their lives were unmistakably in peril...!!
"Aaa...waaaaaaaagggh!! Hel‐hel‐heeeeelllllp......!!!"
Almost paralyzed with fright, the man turned on his heels in an attempt to escape from that place,
 ......and in that instant, the Stake of Sloth......
"............Be thankful that this is the only recompense for your violence against our master.
 Die!!"
A hole as big as a walnut opened in his right eye, and his head split.
Belphegor was sprayed with blood, and her face twisted demonically with the joy of being able to use her full power...!
"Ahh...waaaaaaagghhh?!
 Who?!
 Who\'s there?!
 Where are you?!"
The black‐suits panicked, pointing their guns in every direction.
But they didn\'t understand what was happening.
They only knew that something terrifying was coming for them from somewhere,
 but they didn\'t know where...!!
"Idiots!!
 Th‐the enemy is right in front of you!
 The witch\'s furniture is after you!!!"
But they could not ‘see’...!!
Because they couldn\'t believe in magic, they could not ‘see’...!!
Just as the black witch said, Satan was standing boldly right in front of the black‐suit.
However, the black‐suit couldn\'t ‘see’ that at all...!
"*giggle*...!
 You think Humans could see our forms?
 Perceive us?
 Ahhahahahahahaha, you stupid Humans!!
 Time to pay your foolish compensation for forgetting your awe of magic!!"
"H‐hieeiiiiiie!!!
 What is this?!
 What\'s going on?!"
".........You cannot ‘see’.
 Because you have no love."
"......Impossible!!
 There are so many Humans here, the anti‐magic toxin is everywhere...... How can you manifest your magic?!
 What...are you?!?!"
"............A witch.
 And unlike you, a real one."
"Khhh... Wrraaaaaaaaaaaaaagghhh, damn youuuuuuu, you biiiiiiiitch!!"
As though announcing his candidacy for the fourth victim, one of the black‐suits pointed his gun at Ange.
......And pulled the......
Ange glared at him coldly, and simply ordered.
"F‐fucking diiiiiiiiiiiiiiieeeeeeeee!!"
"Next.
 Satan."
"Satan the Wrathful, already right here!!"
"Slowpoke!!
 You think a simple bullet could hit Ange‐sama or any of us now?!!!"
The Stake of Wrath......pierced and smashed the bullet fired by the black‐suit,
 and continued straight on, towards the man\'s face—
".........Know your foolishness, and regret it in hell!!
 Die!!"
With a terrible explosive sound, the upper half of the man\'s head was smashed.
Bathed in scattered flesh and blood, Ange quietly asked one more time.
"...So, Aunt Kasumi.
 .........Do you still...
not feel like believing in magic?"
"Th‐
this is crazy...
 ......This can\'t be real...!!
 I, I won\'t accept it...!!
 There\'s no way magic is real......!!!"
"Yes, that\'s right...
 There\'s no way magic exists...!!
 There\'s no way witches exist!!"
‘Ma‐......magic exists!!
 Witches exist......!! Uryuu!!’
".........Yes.
 Magic exists.
 Witches exist.
 ......And in this world filled with anger and sadness, you can make them into the key that opens the door to a world of happiness...!!
 I won\'t let someone like you......deny that!!"
‘Everyone holds the key to a world of happiness in the palm of their hand...!
 And no one......has any right to steal that away......!!’
"You poor Human, who cannot understand this...
 .........If there had been magic in your life, it would surely have been very different, and much more peaceful."
"Not once in your entire life were you ever able to meet with a true witch, and for this,
 ......I pity you."
"Eee......eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeekkk!!!"
Kasumi let out a piercing scream.
At the same time, the two remaining black‐suits came for me at once, and thrusted their guns against my head.
......Like they were trying to use me as a hostage against something their eyes couldn\'t ‘see’.
.........Against the Seven Sisters of Purgatory, high‐level furniture who had now reached the level of weapons, this was completely and totally pointless.
"Dammit, where are you?!
 You don\'t stop attacking, and this bitch is dead!!
 Show yourself!!"
"Kyahhahahahahahaha!!!
 What\'s this guy on about?! And his guts look so tasty too.
 .........Ange‐sama, leave the next one to me!"
"Go ahead. Kill him."
"I am so very grateful...!!
 Diiiiiee!!!"
The man\'s chest split, and his guts poured out.
 ......This terrible way of dying threw the other man into a total panic.
However, Asmodeus\'s form was already at his back,
 embracing his neck with her arm, ......and smiling obscenely......
"What a cute kid.
 ......Hey, where do you want me to pierce you?
 *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*, Ange‐sama, do you have any preference?!!!"
"Head."
"Certainly, my masteeeer!!
 Die!!"
The final black‐suit had his head smashed by the Stake of Lust,
 and as his insides scattered, he twisted and fell.
In that gruesome world where six people lay in a sea of blood,
 .........witch and Human confronted each other.
".........Sumadera Kasumi.
 I sympathize with your pitiable life from the bottom of my heart.
 ......I can give you magic to seal up that unfillable hole in your heart.
 If you will believe in that magic, that is."
"D‐don\'t be so......ridiculous......!!
 This, this is, ...I won\'t accept it!!
 Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeekk!!"
As Kasumi slowly retreated backwards, scared out of her wits,
 .....she picked up a handgun that someone had dropped.
Then, shaking, she pointed it at Ange...
"That\'s right, Kasumi...!
 Shoot her with that gun...!!
 Turn your hatred into a bullet and shoot...!!"
"Hiee...hiie...!!
 I\'ll kill you... I\'ll kill you...!!
 If I don\'t kill you, my life will go unrewarded......!!"
"Yes, kill her!
 Pull the trigger!!
 Take all of the anger and pain from your shabby life until now!!
 Use it all against her!"
"If you don\'t, you won\'t be released from your pain and anguish!!"
"............Stop it, Aunt Kasumi.
 ......You mustn\'t lend an ear to the black witch."
"I\'ll kill you...... I\'ll kill you......!
 Because of your mother,
 ......my entire life...
...has been a wreck......!!"
"Then maybe, starting now bit by bit, you can turn that life into something bright and peaceful, with my magic.
 If you simply believe in magic and have a change of heart,
 it can open the door to a new world for you."
"There\'s no such thing!!
 The salvation she speaks of is obviously just some fairy tale!"
"Your life is already covered with thorns until you die...!!
 Let her hear your cries of agony!!
 You can\'t regain anything that was lost... Right? Sumadera Kasumiiiiiiiiii?!?!"
"Yes, you might not be able to regain anything.
 But I\'m sure you can create something new.
 So, Aunt Kasumi.
 Throw that gun away.
 .........I might be able to teach you of a world of happiness too."
"Hiee...
......hiie...hieeiii......!!
 You,
 .........you don\'t know......!!
 Because your mother ran away,
 .........I was forced to marry her fiancé as a substitute...!!"
"You know I had a man who promised to spend his life with me?!
 You know I was forced to break up with him?!
 You think you understand how I felt when I was made to wed in your mother\'s place,
 ......and was forced to consummate the marriage with a man I had barely even talked to?!?!"
"I wanted to kill her!!
 But Nee‐san just went and died on her own!
 That\'s why I\'m going to kill you!!
 Otherwise, my thorn‐covered life will never eeeeeeeend!!"
......From Kasumi\'s eyes,
 frenzied tears dripped down.
This poor woman...
 ......Even she had such clear and beautiful tears.
But for that very reason, ......she hadn\'t been able to withstand her sad pain,
 and had had no choice but to listen to the black witch\'s temptation...
"..................I feel so sorry for you.
 ......In that case, the least I can do is to forever release you and your soul from the bonds of resentment.
 .........That might be the only bit of charity I can give you now."
"Diiiiiiiiiiiee, Ushiromiya Angeeeeeeeeeee!!!"
"Goodbye, Aunt Kasumi.
 .........Take a long rest in a quiet world."
I no longer feel any anger or hatred towards you.
I just want...
to let your soul rest in peace.
Kasumi\'s handgun spat fire.
Slowly, that bullet continued through a world frozen to the utmost limit, ......making its way towards ANGE\'s forehead.
"Mammon."
"......Y‐......yes!!
 Mammon the Covetous, right here...!!"
"Thanks."
"......Huh?"
"It was because I met you and Sakutarou that I was able to understand everything."
‘......Ange......’
"Look away, Sakutarou.
 .........Mammon.
 Release that woman.
 And...protect the honor of Mariage Sorcière...!!"
"Ye‐.........yes!!
 ......Prepare yourself, Sumadera Kasumi!!"
Even though the world was frozen, the Stake of Greed flashed like lightning,
 .........and was already through Kasumi and out the other side...
"If you possess the slightest virtue, you shall have an audience again on the mountain of Purgatory!!
 .........Diiiiiiiieee!!!"
The upper half of Sumadera Kasumi\'s head shattered.
......Her cage of flesh was broken,
 ......and she was finally released......
".........And now...it\'s just you.
 ...........The black witch.
 ......At this point, I feel bad for even seeing a resemblance to Aunt Eva in you."
"Heh, ......heheheheheh.
 ...If my form still looks like Ushiromiya Eva,
 that means you still haven\'t been able to forgive "me" inside yourself."
"I understand, Ange.
 ............You also want to be released from your thorn‐covered life more than anything."
"...................................."
"In that case, ......I\'ve thought of something interesting.
 I\'ll show you magic as well.
 .........I won\'t be the one to kill you."
With the worst smile on her face,
 the black witch changed her form into something like a black mist,
 ...or else a vast swarm of black flying insects, which began to swirl around me.
Then that black mist began to amass bit by bit, ......shaping itself into the form of a human.
".....................What\'s this supposed to be......"
Ehheheheheh!
 I think you know very well what!
That woman you hated and despised the most!
And that woman hated and despised you the most as well...!
When the black mist cleared,
 .........over there was...
.........Aunt Eva\'s form,
 ......as she had been while alive.
......In her hands...she was holding a gun.
"...............Aunt Eva...
...died."
"*giggle*, long time no see, Angeeee.
 ......I\'ve returned from hell to kill youu!
 *cackle*cackle*!!"
Aunt Eva glared at me, laughing madly.
"But......I\'m not that surprised.
 Aunt Eva was that kind of person."
"I imagine my funeral cleared your mood up quite a bit, didn\'t it?
 It did for me too, because it meant that I never have to see your face again...!
 But I did have just one regret.
 And this is it!!"
".........Killing me?
 ............Was that your last request?"
How pitiful.
 ......Even after death,
 ......Aunt wasn\'t released from her suffering......
"It was the black witch\'s power that was the source of my magic.
 Anger and hatred taught me how to work hard and persist.
 Completely different from the escapist magic that you speak of!"
"......The magic you speak of is nothing more than stress reduction through outbursts of anger.
 ......Our magic is different.
 It can remake the entire world.
 .........It\'s of a completely different class than your ill‐natured magic."
"*snicker*!!
 In that case, I\'ll settle it here, once and for all—which comes out on top, black or white...!!
 By my black magic, I have performed a miracle that has allowed me to revive and point a gun at you like this, even after death.
 With what kind of miracle will your white magic fight back?"
"I have taken you in amongst the anti‐magic toxin.
 You won\'t be able to call the Seven Sisters any more.
 That miracle just now won\'t occur again...!!"
"...............But it will, regardless—that\'s the reason it\'s called magic.
 ......Alright.
 Mammon. Lend me your power."
......But Mammon didn\'t respond.
 She didn\'t appear.
Certainly, as she said,
 the anti‐magic toxin had burned everything up like a wasteland parched by a blazing sun...
.........This might be a little tough.
"It\'s useless to call out.
 Never again...
will the Seven Sisters of Purgatory answer you!"
"Like I said.
 I can call them anyway... That\'s what makes it magic, right?"
"........................
 ......You\'re a sad child, Ange.
 So long.
 The simple days we spent together were reasonably fun.
 This is goodbye.
 ......It must be nice for you that this was your final stop."
"Yeah, totally.
 That\'s very thoughtful of you."
"Thanks.
 Then this is farewell."
The barrel of the gun rose slowly,
 ......so that you could see all the way down it.
And,
 .........the trigger was slowly.........
Then,
 ......there was a loud bang from the gun.
...Not in the sense that it fired.
 ......It exploded.
............You\'re...kidding me......
......In shock, inside frozen space,
 ......Eva looked at the exploded gun.
When time unfroze, the fragments would probably smash into her face all at once...
"......Mammon the Covetous.
 Right here."
".....................You\'re...kidding me..."
Behind Eva\'s back, Mammon stood.
 .........She had already penetrated the target I had given her.
 ......Which was...the gun.
"Is this......enough magic for you?
 ............Aunt Eva."
"......A‐
.........Angeee........."
Then, time unfroze.
Fragments of the ruptured gun and gunpowder gas burned her face.
Letting out a shrill scream, she rolled around covering her face......
......It was pitiful.
"......Unlucky.
 ......This is game over.
 Aunt Eva."
I signaled to Mammon.
 ...To free Eva quickly from her pain as she writhed around with her burnt face.
"............Thank you, Mammon.
 ...I\'d like to apologize again, now, from the bottom of my heart, for calling all of you powerless on that day in the classroom.
 You were excellent furniture for protecting witches."
".........It is I who should be grateful.
 ......I feel truly honored to have been able to meet a good witch and a good master in the end, and to have had the opportunity to fulfill my duty as furniture...!"
Mammon understood.
This would be the final job I would ever give her.
Mammon quietly walked close.
Then, she looked down upon her.
"......Aunt Eva.
 Thank you for sticking with me until today.
 This is farewell.
 <Have a nice dream>.
 <See you in hell>."
"<Cool>."
Then, ......the light sound of her forehead being perforated rang out.
......The battle of gunpowder smoke, delirium, ......and white and black magic...was over.
It felt like it had been a long, .........truly long journey.
And the world slowly...
...sank into darkness.........
The stars that should be sparkling.........lay not in the sky, but were scattered beneath me.
......When I recognized that the pearls and rubies were creating a river of white and red,
 I realized that it was a vast nighttime scene that was spread out below me...
I was in the sky of that nighttime scene, neither standing nor flying,
 ......but simply floating in the air.
......From nowhere in particular, I could hear the sound of one person clapping—
a truly dull applause.
I understood.
 ......It was the one who ordered me to go on this journey,
 ......BERNKASTEL.
"...............Congratulations,
 Endless Witch, ANGE BEATRICE.
 At the end of your travels, you understood everything about magic."
"......Yes.
 .........I now...understand everything about magic.
 .........I am...a witch.
 ......The last witch who inherited the magical world created by Mariage Sorcière."
".........No one besides you...can tear BEATRICE\'s world to pieces."
"And it was through coming to know magic.........that I learned also how to resist it."
"................................."
"......Magic is made of love and sadness and anger.
 ......No matter how cruel a witch BEATRICE might have been,
 the source of her magic is exactly the same."
".........And that\'s why, honestly, I wish I could leave that world of hers alone.
 ......After all, in her eyes at least, that world is complete as it is."
"............But then you\'d have to give up on your family."
".....................
 ......That\'s right.
 So, although I feel bad about it, I have to fight.
 .........Because the very reason I left on this journey to become a witch...
...was so that I could bet on the small probability that I could take my family back."
"Unless you kill BEATRICE, only worlds of isolation can exist for you.
 ......As one who has traveled through billions of fragments, I can guarantee it."
"............I understand.
 ......I don\'t have room for compassion.
 ......I must make my heart a demon,
 .........and tear her heart to pieces."
"......It is good that you are steady in your resolve.
 I was worried that, as another witch like her, you might grow attached and lose your will to continue."
Coming from a person like her, whose face was almost always expressionless, those words felt a bit hollow.
BERNKASTEL.
 ......The enigmatic witch who invited me on this journey.
....................................
"There were moments when I suspected that you might have been lying to me."
".....................Why?"
"......I am the Ange of 1998, so even if I save my family, that will only bring relief to the Ange of 1986.
 ......It won\'t do anything for me.
 So I sometimes felt like I was being deceived."
"........................
 ......That is correct.
 I deceived you."
"......But now I\'m grateful.
 .........After all,
 in the end, you did teach me the way to take my family back."
"............I didn\'t teach you anything.
 ......If you have come to know that, it\'s a state of understanding that you reached on your own as a witch.
 That place you have reached is different from mine.
 .........I myself cannot comprehend it, but if it is as you say, then congratulations."
"I am not a player in this game, but a piece.
 You said this to me, right?"
"............Yes, I did."
"Now, I fully understand that role.
 ...............A piece doesn\'t need emotions.
 It just has to give its all for the sake of victory."
"............Yes.
 That\'s exactly right.
 A game is where you each make the best possible move, right?
 If you allow your moves to get distorted by hesitation and indecision, your opponent will be confused as well."
..................Sorry, BEATRICE.
But...don\'t hold it against me.
......“Ushiromiya Ange” still needs her family.
So I have the right to fight you...so that I can take them back.
And you have the responsibility to accept my challenge.
.........So please...don\'t hold it against me.
In exchange...
if you do win in this game,
 I\'ll give you my blessing as well.
Now, let\'s go.
 .........As the piece I am, it\'s finally time for my true turn.
Sorry, BEATRICE.
I can\'t hand Onii‐chan over to you...!!!}
