"Totally!
 Why do guys turn into total morons when they get together?!"
Jessica\'s room was filled with laughter.
"It was one hell of a reality check...!
 I thought this guy was a bit cool, a bit mature.
 And then I see him with some of the other guys in our class, talking about dirty stuff with this creepy laugh!"
"It\'s true that boys always act like little kids when they\'re together."
"Well, it\'s not like girls are any better!"
""Ahhahahahahahaha!!""
The fun chat between girls continued without end.
Tonight, Krauss and Natsuhi were out late at a meeting on Niijima.
Normally, Natsuhi was always watching, so Jessica would make sure to be curt with the young servants,
 but when Natsuhi wasn\'t around, Jessica never did that.
She had invited the servants of similar age to her room, and they were chatting away noisily...
All of them were at the age when they wanted to know about love.
Jessica enjoyed talking about love all the more thanks to the rigid and constricting way she had been brought up, and she seized upon this chance...
"What about you, Milady? You\'ve got charm, you\'re the right age...
 Aren\'t there any boys you\'re interested in?"
"W‐well, I\'d like to fall in love, but there really aren\'t any...g‐good ones around...!"
"I think you should be a bit more proactive when it comes to love.
 You act relaxed now, but it won\'t last long!
 Once one of your friends starts going out with someone, it\'ll turn your world upside down."
"Th‐there\'s no way that\'ll happen...
 None of my friends are traitors...
 I, I think."
"Ah, no, no, no!
 The one thing you definitely can\'t count on from a girl you call your friend is that she won\'t fall in love before you!
 If you met someone you liked, you\'d betray your friends and go out with the guy without a second thought, wouldn\'t you?!"
"A‐ahahahahahahahahahaha......
 Wh‐what about you, Shannon...?!
 It\'s not fair if I\'m the only one who has to talk!"
"I, umm, ......don\'t have anyone like that around..."
......Not around.
He\'s far, far away, ......and like Orihime and Hikiboshi, I don\'t get to see him very often.
In fact, ......I don\'t even know when I\'ll be able to see him again.
......However, I believe that he\'ll come for me someday.
 ......I believe it.
"Don\'t you betray me, okay, Shannon?!
 If we get boyfriends, we\'ll get them together, okay?!
 Right? Right? We promised, right?!"
"Oh, you wouldn\'t think it, but it\'s girls like Shannon‐chan...
who are the type to beat you to the punch!
 *giggle*giggle*!"
"Shannon, fess up!!
 You aren\'t going out with anyone, are you?!
 You aren\'t, right?!"
"I, I\'m not. Really......"
"Really?!"
"R‐really..."
"We\'ll get boyfriends together, okay?
 No matter what happens, okay?!
 Cross your heart and hope to die, stick a needle in your eye!!"
"Y‐yes......
 I promise......"
"That\'s the face of a liar!
 I\'m willing to bet Shannon‐chan\'s the first of us all!
 I can tell.
 It\'s always the quiet ones that go first...!"
"Shannon, how could you?!
 Fess up, fess up!!"
"P‐please stop, Milady...!
 Th‐that tickles...!
 A‐ahahahahaha...!!"
......Amid cheerful laughter, another lazy Sunday afternoon passed by.
I worked my way out of the fight and looked up at the sky through the window.
......I wonder if Battler‐san is somewhere out there right now...
surrounded by his friends and chatting about the same topic we are.
I only hope that you\'re thinking of me...
...the same way that I\'m thinking of you...
But if I beg for that, it\'s the same as admitting that I don\'t trust you.
.........I\'ll wait.
And when you do come for me, I\'ll announce then and there that I\'m quitting my job.
I\'ve already prepared myself for it.
......But...you haven\'t come yet.
That isn\'t because you won\'t come, ......but because I\'m not resolved enough yet, right?
It\'s because I haven\'t clearly envisioned a future with you, right?
I\'ll wait.
 ......No matter how long.
......Until you come for me, riding a white horse...
I will always treasure our promise.
The promise of our precious resolve......
"No, never make a promise with a guy.
 You can\'t count on them!"
Thinking that she had read my mind, I spun around.
Of course, she hadn\'t...
"Well, as far as that goes,
 I think guys and girls have different ideas of what\'s important."
"They do, they do! Totally different.
 On the whole, girls tend to be dreamers, and guys just do stuff without thinking."
"I guess understanding between the sexes is pretty much impossible after all."
"At least, I think it\'s pretty hard.
 Girls often have the bad habit of thinking they know exactly what the guy is thinking right away.
 They search for hidden meanings behind words that guys say for no reason in particular,
 and just get the wrong idea."
"Ah, yeah, I\'ve known girls like that.
 Girls who\'ve taken what anyone could tell them was just some meaningless comment as a sign that the guy is totally into them.
 Yeah, I see it all the time."
"It\'s painful to watch when a girl gets the wrong idea."
Ahhahahahahahahaha.
 The pair of them laughed together.
......When a girl...gets the wrong idea.
 Could that be......me...?
No, that can\'t be.
After all, Battler‐san made a clear promise to me.
He said he\'d come for me riding a white horse.
......I mustn\'t doubt.
I\'m sure this conversation I\'m hearing is just another one of God\'s trials.
So, I won\'t listen.
 I won\'t even think twice about it.
"If there\'s one thing I never want to be, it\'s one of those embarrassing girls who thinks a guy\'s heart is linked to hers for no reason."
"Ahhahahahahahahahahahaha."
Those demonic sneers tormented me and tried to lead me astray.
......I\'m sure he\'ll come to the next family conference......
But Battler‐san didn\'t come to the 1982 conference either......
More and more things keep changing away from the way they were at the last family conference he came to.
Kyrie‐sama, Rudolf‐sama\'s new wife, now blends in perfectly here,
 ......coming down off the boat with a familiar stride.
Her daughter, Ange‐sama, is growing well, and all of the family focus their attention on her.
Also, Maria‐sama, who was so small at the time, is already five years old.
 She is full of energy, and old enough to enjoy playing with George‐sama.
Neither Jessica‐sama nor George‐sama brought up Battler‐san\'s absence.
The other relatives were the same way.
 ......No one touches upon the subject, as though they\'ve forgotten that Battler‐san is missing.
Maria‐sama was only three when she last saw Battler‐san.
I doubt whether she even remembers him.
......In just two short years...
All trace of your existence......has been erased from the Ushiromiya family conference.
That made me sad.
 And so I said...
"......It looks like Battler‐sama didn\'t come back this year either."
"True.
 ......Do you miss having him here?"
"Well, ......umm......"
"Uncle Rudolf and Auntie Kyrie don\'t even bring him up anymore.
 ......It looks like Battler‐kun was much more serious than we thought."
"I wonder if he really will stay away forever."
"Looks like it was leaving the nest after all.
 He\'s spread his wings and left for a new stage of life.
 That\'s my assumption."
"......He\'s always been crazy and reckless.
 Well, what more\'d you expect from a guy?"
"Well, we know Battler‐kun.
 I\'m sure he\'s adapted to his new life and is enjoying himself.
 So, there\'s no reason to worry."
Even though George‐sama said that with a smile, his words disconcerted me.
He\'s "enjoying himself", so there\'s "no reason to worry"...?
 .........What is that supposed to mean......?
"This is Battler we\'re talking about, so you can bet he\'s forgotten all about us and is having a great time."
"Yeah, I\'m sure that\'s the case.
 And I think that\'s best for him.
 Battler‐kun must have given a lot of thought to himself, his family, and his late mother, and made the independent decision to start a new life.
 So, I hope he lives that new life with conviction.
 Forgetting about the Ushiromiya family would do him a lot of good."
George‐sama smiled at me, expecting me to agree.
......After a moment of shock, I smoothed my expression over and found the expression he was expecting.
Is Battler‐san......living happily,
 ......having forgotten about the family, about me, about our promise......?
That can\'t be true. It just can\'t be.
Battler‐san must be striving to reach that day of resolve just like me.
I\'m not mistaken about that.
He promised me.
He said he\'d come riding a white horse.
I never asked him to say that.
He said he\'d come for me on the day I resolved to live life for his sake.
He made that promise himself.
For two years,
 I\'ve believed that.
I\'ve done all I could to make it through God\'s trials and the whisperings of demons that tried to throw me from my path.
And yet, ......the things both George‐sama and Jessica‐sama are saying...are so cruel.
Battler‐san has forgotten about us and has started a new life?
Why are they telling such obvious lies......?
But that night...
I dreamed of Battler‐san for the first time in a long while.
The Battler‐san in my dream.........wasn\'t the Battler‐san I believed in.
......It was the Battler‐san that George‐sama and Jessica‐sama had spoken of,
 .........the one who had forgotten everything and started a new life.
Morning arrived.
 I woke up with a tear‐stained face.
The me in the mirror......whimpered through tears that she couldn\'t wait any longer.
If you\'ve managed to wait this long, why can\'t you wait any longer...?
This is a trial.
 ......We have to believe in him and wait.
But the me in the mirror spoke.
 ......It was sharper than a fragment of glass.
.........We talk about this promise, ......but did we actually make a promise with him...?
Don\'t you remember what Jessica‐sama said?
 ......That some girls are dreamers who get the wrong idea?
Don\'t you remember what George‐sama said?
 ......That Battler‐san has gotten used to his new life......and has forgotten about the Ushiromiya family?
.........He wouldn\'t be the only one to forget.
Without me asking about Battler‐san, everyone on this island would have forgotten his name.
Even Rudolf‐sama doesn\'t say his name anymore.
If I weren\'t here to remember his face,
 ......perhaps his existence would have been erased from the hearts and minds of everyone here.
......I don\'t believe it.
 So, I won\'t doubt him.
Battler‐san must still remember our promise.
We\'re both waiting for the day of resolve, the day we\'ll be together.
 ............Battler‐san.
My mind is firmly made up.
Does the fact that you\'re not here mean that I\'m still not resolved enough?
No.
 ......It\'s because you and God are testing me, isn\'t it?
In that case, I will endure.
Until that promised day inevitably comes.
.........So, ......please.
 Battler‐san.
I want some sign......that you haven\'t forgotten me.........
That...was the crack that ran across my ceramic heart.
At last, I had to acknowledge the possibility.
......The possibility that something terrible and dreadfully sad was happening......and I was pretending not to notice.
Battler‐san...makes me yearn for him.
Battler‐san...makes me sad.
Battler‐san...makes it hurt.........
Battler‐san.
......Do you still remember me, now.........?
And then......came the third family conference since Battler‐san left.
If the number of beds was going to increase, we would be told about that when setting up.
The fact that nothing has changed in particular......means that he probably won\'t be here this year either.
Clinging to a final bit of hope, I stood by the docks, watching the boat draw closer.
"Hey, Shannon‐chan.
 You\'re looking as pretty as ever."
"Careful, Ange.
 Watch your step."
"Hey, Shannon. You know, I love visiting Rokkenjima...!
 Uncle Krauss really should hurry up with his plans to turn it into a resort."
"Why bother?
 It\'d be such a waste."
"Eheheh, maybe it would.
 How have you been, Shannon‐chan?
 I think you\'ve gotten a bit taller since last time."
"......Thank you very much."
"And the weather\'s good again this year...!
 We should count our blessin\'s that we can bring the whole family together like this without a single one of us missin\'."
"Please allow me to guide you to the mansion......"
So, after all, ......Battler‐san has been so thoroughly forgotten that he might as well not have existed in the first place.
The sadness must be showing on my face.
Not wanting anyone to see it, ......I turned my back to the family and led the way up to the mansion.
Then, ......suddenly, someone mentioned Battler‐san\'s name, and I jumped.
"What, you saw Battler‐kun?"
"Is he doing well...?!"
"Yes,
 he\'s doing very well.
 I took Ange and had some tea with him the other day."
I was surprised.
 ......So, Kyrie‐sama was in touch with Battler‐san.
According to her, the fight between Battler‐san and Rudolf‐sama had calmed down a long time ago,
 but both were so stubborn that they hadn\'t found a good chance to make up.
And since Battler‐san had gotten used to living with his grandparents and going to school near there,
 it wasn\'t going to be easy to get him to come back home, especially considering that the grandparents were adding extra complications.
"......It\'s just too bad.
 I think Asumu‐san\'s parents were even more angry than Battler‐kun was.
 This isn\'t just an issue between Battler‐kun and Rudolf‐san anymore."
"Then will Battler be coming back sometime soon?"
"He will make up with Rudolf‐san, but it looks like he doesn\'t intend to return to the Ushiromiya family.
 ......Such a shame.
 Though I do understand how he feels."
It was a bit of a relief to hear that some of the bad feeling had died down in these three years.
Taking Asumu‐sama\'s parents into account, it\'s no surprise that things haven\'t gone as well as they could.
But if Battler‐san doesn\'t hate Rudolf‐sama anymore, ......then someday...
......Surely he\'ll come back.
 He\'ll have grown so much.
My resolve will never waver again.
For some nights these past three years, I\'ve felt sad and resentful.
But now, ......it feels as though those three years were something I needed.
After all, ......the seeds of love, the faint feelings I once had for you...
...have budded powerfully, waiting for the day that we\'ll be reunited.
This is how honest my feelings for you are now.
.........I...love you.
I want to see you again as soon as I can.
Until that time, ......I\'ll keep this sprout of love warm and growing for you......
I won\'t doubt the coming of that day anymore.
Just as I think of you, under the same sky...
...I believe that you are thinking of me.
......I\'m sure this news about him is a sign that God is cheering me on.
So, I asked God one more time, inside my heart.
Since my feelings for Battler‐san have not wavered for a day these past three years...
Let me know that he feels the same way.
I know that asking for that is a sin.
However, now that we\'ve reached a three‐year turning point,
 ......I want some gift from God, any gift, to show that I have not waited in vain.
That is what I prayed.
"Oh, that\'s right.
 It\'s been so long since Battler‐kun last saw you all, right?
 I thought you might be feeling lonely, so I told him to write you letters.
 Here they are."
..................Huh...?
Did God......really hear my prayers?
I felt as though my heart was going to leap out of my chest.
"A letter from Battler?
 Awesome!
 What\'d he write?!"
"Did he say anything about how he\'s been doing lately?
 I can\'t wait to read it."
Kyrie‐sama pulled a brown envelope out of her bag and handed it to George‐sama.
Just one?
When George‐sama opened it, several folded letters came out.
"Looks like this one\'s addressed to me.
 ......They all have different names on them.
 Here, this one\'s yours, Jessica‐chan."
"Thanks!"
"And this one\'s for Maria‐chan.
 Will she be able to read it...?"
"I\'ll read it to her later.
 Thank you."
"There\'s even one for Ange‐chan.
 Now of course she can\'t read."
"*giggle*.
 I\'ll give it to her when she does learn."
"He says he\'s doing great and having a blast...!
 That\'s awesome."
"......Umm,
 ......is that...
all of them...?"
"Yep.
 Looks like that\'s all of them.
 Thanks a lot."
George‐sama handed me the empty envelope.
......Apparently, he thanked me because he thought I was offering to throw it away for him.
And, clearly, ......there was nothing inside it.
There was no letter for me...
"Whoa.
 The more I read, the more fun it looks like Battler‐kun\'s been having.
 Living every day to the fullest."
"That\'s what it looks like in mine, too.
 If he\'s happy, then I guess that\'s what counts."
"*giggle*.
 That\'s so mean of Battler‐kun.
 It sounds like he forgot about us until you told him to write those letters."
"Well, you know what he\'s like.
 Battler‐kun enjoys life.
 And I hear he\'s popular with the ladies at school, too."
"Wow...!
 Incredible!"
"There should be plenty of girls who like those hilarious, melodramatic lines of his.
 Makes sense to me."
"I wonder if he really does plan to stay away."
"It looks like he does.
 In my letter, it says that he doesn\'t plan to return to Rokkenjima."
I know that all these letters and the things written inside them...
...are trials from God.
The absence of a letter for me,
 the information that he\'s enjoying life and has forgotten about Rokkenjima,
 ......are all just trials upon trials.
He is...
 God is...
...testing me.
The fact that I\'m the only one without a letter is proof of that......
 ............I...
............wanted to believe that............
......But...
......at last.........
I couldn\'t believe any longer...............
"......It might\'ve been an important promise to you,
 ......but it looks like it wasn\'t for Battler."
"................................."
"......No way.
 ......Then, that promise about him coming on a white horse was..."
"I was a dreamer... It was just an illusion I created......"
"To Battler, they were probably just meaningless words to make him sound cool."
......What a ludicrous story it might seem to an outside observer.
That promise with Battler might have been an illusion the whole time.
We don\'t even know......if they felt the same way about each other in the first place.
Love is an illusion.
When both sides see the same illusion, the love becomes true.
However, when the feelings of each side are different, ......then it\'s nothing more than a joke.
"This is Battler\'s sin."
"......That he created the illusion......of a promise."
"No."
".........Huh?"
"......It\'s that he didn\'t even remember."
"If he had simply broken his promise, ......I could have confronted him about it.
 I could have regretted, or I could have recovered.
 .........However, since he didn\'t even remember, I am unable to question him about it."
".............................."
"I am unable to hate Battler‐san.
 ......After all, Battler‐san didn\'t even break his promise."
"There just wasn\'t......any promise from the beginning."
"......It was nothing more than a sad.........joke."
.........I kept on crying and crying.
I dug my fingernails into my pillow, soaking it with my tears.
How much easier it would be to hate something...
But I can\'t hate anything.
I just couldn\'t get over my miserable arrogance,
 ......which had led me to believe for three whole years that he felt the same as I did.
"......I am to blame for this.
 ......My irresponsible words led you to believe that Battler made a promise..."
"No.........
 This isn\'t anyone\'s fault.
 ......It\'s all because I assumed that he felt the same way I did..."
"Battler did not make a promise.
 However, that does not mean his feelings were anything to be laughed at!
 Though there might have been a difference in degree when compared to yours,
 it is true that he liked you!
 Of that, there can be no doubt."
"......Please, ......just stop it......
 ......I\'ve believed that he liked me the way I liked him, ......without ever doubting that.
 .........Please don\'t try to cheer me up.
 ......I\'d rather......that you mocked me........."
Before I knew it......
a dull inescapable pain had pierced my chest.
When I pressed my hand against my chest, I realized what that pain was.
It was the bud of love, which I had sown the seeds of and raised in my heart.
Its roots had spread throughout my chest,
 ......tormenting me like a metal wire wrapped around my heart.
Rather than roots, ......they looked more like fissures running through my heart.
The only way to kill the pain would be to tear out the roots of love.
But no matter how much I clawed at them, it was only my heart that got torn and scratched.
 ......The roots of love didn\'t move at all.
If my feelings for Battler‐san were to turn to hate, without any lingering interest or regrets,
 ...I\'d be able to pull out these roots easily.
They would probably leave a hole behind, but at least they wouldn\'t hurt me anymore.
But they won\'t come out.
 ......Even though it hurts so much, those roots of love are still stuck in my heart.
"......Shannon..............."
"I...
 .........Even now,
 ......I love Battler‐san...
......so much.
 ......I miss him.
 I want him to come back......
 I believe he will come back someday,
 ......and I want to wait for him...
 ......But...
...now it\'s just...
...too much........."
As I sobbed, the tightness in my chest grew even stronger.
As long as I love Battler‐san, that pain will always continue.
Because I love him, I want to hold onto that pain forever.
But......it was written right there in the letters for George‐sama and the others.
Battler doesn\'t plan on returning to the Ushiromiya family.
He\'s forgotten about me and Rokkenjima,
 ......and has started a new life with a different name.
I have to endure all this aching, biting, agonizing pain...
......and wait forever for someone who will never return...
"Is this another trial......?
 To wait for him forever?
 ......Is that what God is asking of me......?
 I can\'t do that......
 I...
...want to be with Battler‐san.
 But if this is the trial...
that I must go through for that...
...it\'s just...
......too painful......"
"...................................."
BEATRICE hung her head in shame.
If she hadn\'t encouraged Shannon so much, it probably wouldn\'t have been this painful.
Shannon may have been the one to sow the seed of love in her heart.
However, BEATRICE had irresponsibly watered it and told Shannon not to give up.
......BEATRICE scratched at her chest, trying to share Shannon\'s pain...
"........................This is...my fault."
BEATRICE mumbled to herself.
"......How can any of this be your fault?"
"For three years, I tortured you with the illusion of a promise that never happened.
 ......If I had not nourished the bud of love within you, ......you would not have suffered so."
"................................."
"Shannon.
 This may sound harsh, ......but listen."
"...............What is it...?"
"Forget Battler.
 ......There was no bud of love in the first place."
"......No.
 I\'m the one who nourished it.
 ......No matter how painful it is, I can\'t forget it."
"But you cannot bear that pain any longer, can you......?"
"......................................."
Wordlessly, Shannon held her chest and hung her head.
I......yearn for Battler.
Even now, that feeling burns inside me,
 ......and no matter how much it hurts, I can\'t let it go.
I\'ve spent three years pretending not to notice that pain.
Now, I know that I feel it.
And now that I know, ......it\'s unbearable...
"So, you cannot throw away your bud of love for Battler?"
"..................I can\'t."
"However, at this rate,
 ......the bud...the roots...will kill you."
".............................."
"People need a universe to survive.
 ......And one person cannot create that universe alone.
 Two are needed."
".........A universe......"
"Together with Battler, you created the universe of that bud of love.
 ......Now that one half of that pair is gone, your universe has crumbled.
 ......People cannot......complete a universe on their own."
"But...
...the other person who creates my universe,
 ......Battler‐san, won\'t come back..."
"Then you must create a new universe with someone else."
".........You mean, ......create one with someone other than Battler‐san?"
"I will give you that someone."
"......Who are you.........talking about......?"
"A creature to bury the pain in your heart and heal you.
 ......He will not betray you.
 ......Yes, ......let it be a sibling.
 ............I will give you a little brother."
"A little brother..............."
"A boy you have always been close to at the Gospel House, whom you love as if he were your real brother.
 ......That, I shall give to you.
 ......Together with him, you will create a new universe."
"......Will that little brother......make me forget about the pain of my love for Battler‐san......?"
"Indeed.
 .........You need a universe."
"Then, ......what will happen to the bud of love...
...in my heart?
 .........My feelings for Battler‐san won\'t change.
 ......I can\'t make them wither."
"..............................
 ......I shall accept that bud and those roots...
in your place."
"......You will............?"
"You can forget the pain of love and create a new universe.
 ......I will accept the bud of love in your place.
 ......It means that I will accept the pain as well, ......but I will also learn of the single element I do not possess,
 ......the element of love."
BEATRICE......wanted to know love.
She wanted to feel what Shannon had felt in the world of humans.
".........And,
 if Battler ever does return,
 if the bud still has not withered and you still desire it,
 I shall return it to you.
 ......What do you think of that?"
"...................................."
Still hanging her head, ......Shannon gave a small nod, but said nothing.
It would mean release from this unbearable pain.
And...it would mean giving the bud of love to the witch, to hold in her place......
Shannon spread the hands that she had held to her chest.
As she did, a faint light slipped out of her chest and floated in the air,
 ......gradually swallowing everything with its brightness.
As the brilliant light began to fade away, Shannon and BEATRICE, still facing each other,
 were now inside a vast, starry sphere, like a planetarium.
They were the only ones in this pitch‐black starry sea.
.........Shannon felt as though she had seen this place once before, but she could not remember.
Then, I made another announcement.
"The world shall be modified.
 ......Let the bud of love travel from Shannon to BEATRICE."
This way, Shannon won\'t be tormented by the bud of love anymore.
On top of this, so that Shannon can create a new universe, ......I\'ll give her a little brother.
The backstory for the little brother will be a younger boy at the Gospel House with whom Shannon was close.
For a name, ...............let there be the {ruby:on:音} character, as Gospel House rules state.
............Yeah, I\'ve decided.
......That\'s a perfect name to go with Shannon\'s.
He\'ll be......a quiet, reticent boy.
He\'ll come to Rokkenjima as a new servant.
There, he\'ll establish an immediate rapport with Shannon.
As a duty‐minded boy who loves Shannon like a big sister, he\'ll always be there for her......
Let\'s have him be a special servant like Genji, who is permitted to serve Kinzo directly.
 ......Yeah.
 That sounds kinda cool.
Then, BEATRICE.
From now on, you will carry the bud of love.
In other words, ......the role of being infatuated with Battler and waiting for his return will go to you.
While you are still the witch who reigns over Rokkenjima\'s night...
You have also been waiting for Ushiromiya Battler, ever since that day three years ago.
Along with this change in setting, I\'ll give you a new form as well...
He did tell us what his ideal woman would look like once, remember?
......A woman with a great figure and long, golden hair, like a foreign model.
 Golden hair.
 Long hair.
 A great figure.
......Yeah.
 Something like that.
That\'s what the new BEATRICE will look like.
Come now, hold that bud of love in your heart as you wait for Battler.
......You will learn of love at last...and pay the price of pain.
Yes, this will be the setting for my new world.
For Shannon, a new servant like a little brother will come.
He will be a silent, reticent boy.
 A duty‐minded kid who loves Shannon as a sister.
And the bud of love that has tortured Shannon......will go to the witch, BEATRICE.
She will just be holding onto the bud of love for the time being.
However, while she holds onto it, she will be a maiden in love with Battler.
For that time, you will be able to learn what love is......
Come, let the world be modified.
Oh, I am one yet many.
Awaken, us.
And stretch your wings in this new world......
.........Slowly, .........I opened my eyes to the gentle rays of the morning sun.
..............................
How long has it been since I woke to such a pleasant morning?
......The face in my mirror is tear‐stained and pathetic.
However, ......my heart is as clear as the morning sun.
I could still clearly remember that strange dream.
However, I could feel myself forgetting it rapidly...
The place I\'d been in my dreams......had been such a strange place.
A peaceful, calm place.
......There, ......I had left behind the pain I had carried in my chest until yesterday.
So this morning, my heart was at peace...
"Good morning, me........."
My tear‐stained face really looked pathetic.
However, my expression was bright and cheery.
I still do...
...love...
Battler‐san.
But, ......I think I\'d say...
......I\'ve calmed down.
It feels like I\'ve put something precious safely away in the place it belongs.
............Battler‐san.
 When will you come back, I wonder...
When you do, I\'d like to talk about mystery novels again.
......Oh, I almost forgot.
A new boy servant will be coming today, won\'t he?
One of the rare servants who will serve the Master directly.
What kind of kid will he be?
 I hope we get along well......
What was his name again?
I think......it was......
