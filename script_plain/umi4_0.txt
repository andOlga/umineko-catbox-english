"Wahahahaha, you alright, Battler‐kun...?!
 We\'re already on the ground, y\'know, you can\'t fall any further than that, wahahahaha...!"
"Uu, *giggle*giggle*!
 Gonna faaall, gonna faaall, *giggle*giggle*!"
In the lobby of the Niijima airport, Maria dashed around in excitement.
Battler\'s uproar in the plane must have been very funny to her.
"Hey, Maria!
 That\'s enough!
 ...Sorry, Battler‐kun.
 Don\'t take it badly."
"Man, you\'re {i:pathetic}.
 A grown‐ass man like you still can\'t handle vehicles?"
"Urgh, shut up...
 All humans have one or two things they can\'t handle..."
"Battler‐kun, why don\'t you come with your aunt on an overseas trip sometime soon?
 What about Europe?
 I\'m sure you\'d conquer your fears after the half‐day plane trip.
 *giggle*giggle*giggle*!"
"...Stop it, Mother.
 I\'m sure Battler‐kun\'s dislike for vehicles is inherited."
"Oh, from Asumu‐san?"
"......For some reason, she just couldn\'t handle vehicles.
 Pretty much anything other than a bicycle or a car.
 Whenever we tried to take a trip somewhere far away, that woman was so annoying with the "no not this, no not that,
 I\'m scared I\'m scared, I\'m going to fall I\'m going to fall, scream scream"."
"Children tend to learn that things which their parents can\'t seem to handle are dangerous.
 Battler‐kun must have seen Asumu‐san doing something like that and learned that vehicles are scary."
"*giggle*giggle*.
 Could it be Asumu‐san\'s genes, I wonder?"
"Beats me.
 Those\'d be some damned annoying genes.
 .........Stop talking about Asumu.
 Right now, the one who\'s here is you.
 Right?"
"...You\'re right, sorry."
"Heyyy, the cars are here!
 Exactly three of \'em.
 All in, all in!"
"Gonna fall, gonna faaall!!
 Where\'s the parachuuute, where\'s the parachuuuute!!
 Uu‐uu, *giggle*!!"
"You little rapscallio~n!!
 Wait, wait, come back here, you!
 I\'ll sentence you to the tickle punishme~nt!!"
"Ehheheheheh.
 It\'s good that they\'re in high spirits.
 If Battler‐kun and Maria‐chan weren\'t there, the atmosphere in that plane would have been very stiff."
"Thanks.
 I\'ll take that at face value.
 ......Hey, brats!
 The taxis are here!
 Save the games for later."
"Uu‐uu!!
 Taxiii, taxiii!!
 I\'m gonna be first iiiiin!
 *giggle*!!"
"Hey!
 Maria, and you too, Battler‐kun, stop fooling around!
 You\'ll bump into someone!"
The tone of Auntie Rosa\'s voice became a little frightening.
Battler, too, had started to think that perhaps he really was fooling around too much...when, just as expected, he bumped into someone.
"Oh, sorry..."
"Battler‐kun, your family is going in the car over there.
 You\'re keeping them waiting."
Rushed on by George, Battler made an apologetic gesture to the person he had bumped into and ran up to his parents, who were telling him to come quickly.
With clunking sounds, the doors on the three taxis were shut one after another, and they departed, heading for the harbor......
......As their taxis dashed away...
...the entire world grew suddenly dull,
 ......and slowed to a halt.
Voices, the wind, and even sound—
absolutely everything ceased, and as if they had been frozen in the instant a photo was taken, everything moving or about to move...
...stopped.
People, machines, clock hands, even the dust dancing in the wind—frozen.
People who were in the middle of walking—frozen, with one foot still raised.
Scraps of paper dancing in the wind—frozen, pinned in midair.
......And among these stationary figures in this world that had come to a standstill, a single one...moved.
It was a woman.
 The very woman that Battler had just bumped into...
It was truly the slightest of movements.
Her gaze dropped, her shoulders lowered a minuscule amount, and she sighed.
...That was all.
In a normal world, that probably wouldn\'t even count as movement,
 but in this still world, it looked very out of place.
...Then something else moved.
It was a black cat that had been dozing in the shadows near the taxi rank.
It came up right behind the woman,
 ......and leisurely...changed its form into that of a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}.
It wasn\'t a cat.
 It was a witch.
Of course, the woman was also a witch.
As the witch stood there, her gaze still downwards, she muttered...
".........I can\'t stop them...
...from going to Rokkenjima, can I..."
"You cannot.
 On October 4th, 1986, you are not here."
"......So if I had been here, it might even have been possible to stop them all from going...?"
"What verbal acrobatics a six‐year‐old girl could possibly perform to persuade them to turn back,
 I can\'t even imagine.
 ......But yes.
 If you had been in this place, the probability wouldn\'t have been zero.
 If there is a probability other than zero, I can find a miracle."
"......If I hadn\'t been sick,
 ...and they hadn\'t left me behind......"
With her head facing downwards, the witch tightened her fists...
...They were trembling very slightly.
"You were sick in bed starting October 3rd, 1986.
 And Beato\'s game board is a snippet of time beginning on October 4th.
 ......You are not given the possibility of not getting sick.
 ...In other words, you are fundamentally an existence which can never step up onto the game board."
"Thanks for being so patronizing.
 ......I\'m aware of that.
 ......I know that just seeing Mom, Dad,
 .........and Onii‐chan healthy and happy like this,
 ......that alone...
...is a very wonderful miracle...
 .........I know that all too well..."
Ange had been trying to stand in the way of her family, and prevent them from going outside the airport, ......towards Rokkenjima.
...But that was impossible for Ange, who could not exist there on October 4th, 1986.
Just receiving a shoulder‐bump and words of apology from her older brother...
...Even though he hadn\'t known that she was his sister,
 ...that was still such a miracle,
 ......it could have moved her to tears......
"............I\'m sorry for the sarcasm.
 I won\'t waste the miracle you\'ve given me."
"I\'m glad to hear it.
 ......Now, let\'s go with them.
 To Rokkenjima.
 Soon, all of the pieces will be gathered.
 ......The curtain will open on the fourth game.
 Beato and Battler will already be seated by now."
"......To Rokkenjima......
 ............To the day my...
no,
 ......the day {i:everyone\'s} fates changed...October 4th, 1986,
 ...on Rokkenjima........."
...What happened on that day?
I will expose that.
 Learn that.
 And I\'ll take them back...!
As she stood there with her fists still clenched, she surely turned her face to the heavens.
A single teardrop from the depths of her eyes dripped down into the air.
And when time started moving again, the two witches\' figures were sucked into a blowing gale, and erased in an instant.
