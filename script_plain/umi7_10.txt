"Yasu.
 What\'d you do with the small broom?"
"......Didn\'t you use it to clean the window frames?"
Ah, ............
The small broom is a small, thin broom that looks like a large paintbrush.
We use it to clear out the dust in small corners, like window frames.
It\'s one of the cleaning tools I was put in charge of...
"Come on, that was your responsibility, right?!
 What\'re you doing, stupid?!"
"Quickly, go and find it...
 You have to do it before Madam finds out..."
"What\'s up?"
"Yasu lost the small broom again.
 Is this kid some sort of genius at losing things?!"
"That\'s why I\'m always telling you, never give things to Yasu.
 Yasu\'s always careless and losing things."
"Don\'t say that, can\'t you see this kid\'s working hard...?
 Come on, quickly.
 I\'ll wait for you."
O‐okay......
Not wanting to hear the servants complain even more, I spun around and headed off.
If you lose a tool, you get in trouble.
 If no one knows who did it, we all get yelled at,
 so one of them will probably tell Madam that it was my fault.
Still, it\'s my fault that I lost it in the first place.
I wonder when I lost it.
When, when......
We did a big clean of the entire chapel today.
The chapel is a large building behind the mansion.
 However, no one ever goes near it, normally.
Even so, we\'re ordered to clean the chapel a few times each year.
Kinzo calls it a sacred building, so Natsuhi is very strict about it......
We cleaned every little nook and cranny, from top to bottom.
It took all day.
I\'d been put in charge of cleaning the window frames, but I was also given many smaller tasks.
While those small jobs kept me busy, I must have completely forgotten about the small broom...
...and left it lying around somewhere.
......I hate myself for doing this.
This isn\'t the first time this has happened.
It happens all the time.
Every time I set something down, it always disappears.
It goes somewhere else. Vanishes.
I\'ve come to think that these might be pranks by the witch {f:5:Beatrice}.
The ghost of the witch {f:5:Beatrice} borrowed the power of Rokkenjima\'s evil spirits to become reborn.
Until Kumasawa‐san told me, I never knew the meaning of the shrine on the rocks by the sea.........
"Kumasawa told an old, old tale, passed down among the local fishermen.
 Rokkenjima used to be known as Akujikijima,
 and terrible evil spirits who ate human souls lived there......"
"Hey, Kumasawa!
 Let us hear too!"
"Tell us the scary, scary tale of Rokkenjima\'s evil spirits!"
"Hoh‐hoh‐ho, very well, very well.
 Rokkenjima used to be called Azukijima.
 However, even deeper in the distant past, it was known as Akujikijima.
 It was rumored that sailors who got too near the island were dragged down to the bottom of the sea and had their souls eaten."
"......Those frightening spirits do exist on this island, you know?
 Hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho."
"It was Kumasawa\'s favorite ghost story.
 Every new servant who came to the island heard about it.
 .........Normally, such a story would be laughed away; however, on Rokkenjima, an island home to nothing but the Rokkenjima mansion,
 which rumbled with eerie thunder on stormy nights, people listened to the story with unusual respect."
"So the shrine by the coast is there to seal evil spirits away!"
"And the Master has that weird occult hobby, too!"
"And the mansion is so creepy, something must be lurking around somewhere!"
"Hoh‐hohoho.
 True, true.
 Sealing up the spirits was all that the traveling ascetic could manage.
 The seal just manages to hold them, but to this very day, they wander through the mansion, night after night, searching for a victim.
 Hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho......"
"Have you seen the Master\'s study?!"
"I have!
 It\'s like some kind of demon laboratory!"
"There\'s that rumor about the Master researching demons!"
"They also say he\'s researching how to revive his mistress, Beatrice!"
"Didn\'t they say he was gathering children to be sacrifices for his magic experiments?!"
"Waah, scary!
 What will I do if the Master asks me to come into the study alone?!"
"I heard that, long ago, one kid went into the study and never came out!"
"She must have been a victim of an experiment to give Beatrice\'s ghost a new body!"
"Hoh‐hoh‐ho.
 Yes, {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama has become a ghost, and wanders around searching for a body.
 The VIP room on the second floor is where {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama dwells...
 You must always be respectful when cleaning that room...
 Otherwise...
.........uhihihihihhihhi~!"
"In the eyes of those teenage boys and girls with their fertile imaginations, the ghost story was both terrifying and fascinating.
 By experiencing and sharing in a story together, a kind of solidarity forms.
 Then, sharing in that experience becomes obligatory,
 and accepting the story becomes a rite of passage for joining the group.
 That process was an old one that had repeated many times as the story was passed down."
"That\'s right.
 Back when I first started work at Rokkenjima,
 I heard that story from Kumasawa‐san and the older servants."
"I heard about it too, mostly from Nee‐san."
"I heard it too.
 From Kumasawa‐san, mainly."
"So, not only the timid‐looking Shannon,
 but a boy, Kanon, and a big adult, Gohda, believed in the ghost story?"
"Well, I didn\'t really {i:believe}..."
"There are tales of ghost stories and jinxes in all jobs.
 There were several stories of the sort at the hotel I once worked at."
"So, you thought it was stupid, and you didn\'t pay it any mind?"
"......I think there was a need to blend with the community."
"That\'s it.
 Ghost stories and jinxes are all the local rules of your workplace.
 If a newcomer turns his nose up at them, he can\'t expect to blend in."
"Exactly.
 ......If I said witches couldn\'t exist, that it was ridiculous, then I\'d get into a fight with Nee‐san.
 It was easier if I just appeared to go along with it."
"Come on. If you look at it that way, you\'ll be cursed...
 There was one servant who got seriously injured..."
"Hahaha, all workplaces have stories like that.
 No matter how incredible the ghost stories or the tales about the company founder are, you accept and believe them.
 That\'s what it means to blend in with your new workplace."
""Wow!
 Everyone\'s so mature!""
I went to each window around the chapel in the order I had cleaned them, searching carefully in all the places I might have left it.
I had been cleaning the windows with it, so I\'d probably set it down near one of those.
......When did I leave it behind, I wonder?
Now that I think about it, I don\'t think I had it anymore when I reached the last window,
 so I must have completely forgotten to clean that window frame.
"..................Ah."
Through the window, I could see the others leaving in groups.
Shannon turned around and glanced up in my direction, looking worried.
......I don\'t want to be responsible for making everyone wait, so it\'s actually a relief that they\'re leaving without me...
Still, ......naive though it may have been, I wanted them to wait......
The sun\'s beginning to set, and the chapel\'s getting darker and darker.
I don\'t want to hang around in a place like this all by myself.
I\'d better find the small broom fast.
No, that\'s not all.
 I also need to clean the window frames I forgot.
Madam is strict.
 She\'ll probably check all of the windows carefully.
If she does, I\'ll be the one that gets in trouble tomorrow.
But really, where did I lose it?
 Why did I lose it?
The darkness grew and grew.
......When it became dark enough that I would need a light before long, I began to panic.
I dashed around and around the chapel, tears streaming down my face...
As I stumbled about pathetically,
 I could feel the presence of a prankster witch, giggling at me from under the door and up by the ceiling.
The ghost of {f:5:Beatrice}, the Master\'s mistress, wanders about in search of a body to this very day.
As she gains the power of Rokkenjima\'s evil spirits, her strength steadily grows, and she waits for the day of her resurrection.
And, ......for some reason, she\'s singled me out,
 and if I ever take my eyes off something for a second, she snatches it away and hides it.
This isn\'t the first time this has happened.
Whenever I look away, .........keys, handkerchiefs, pencils, erasers...
all of them vanish almost right away.
I put things down planning to use them later, or because that\'s obviously the right place to leave them,
 and still they disappear as soon as I turn around.
It isn\'t someone hiding them as a prank.
It\'s happened many times when I\'m the only person around.
......Everyone always says I\'m too careless and forgetful, and they laugh at me, get mad at me.
I do try to be alert,
 but like some kind of bad joke, I lose things easily when I forget about them for just a short while.
So, sometimes, I think "I bet this eraser is going to disappear just like everything else", and I stare at it.
 That\'s the only time when it doesn\'t disappear.
 Nothing disappears when I\'m alert.
So then I think I\'m safe, but the moment I start to think that and relax just a little bit, a {i:different} thing will disappear instead...!
 Why is it always me......?!
{a:c:
*giggle*giggle*,
 ......ehehehehahahaha......}
......Yeah, I hear it.
I can hear that witch laughing at me as I lamely run around in circles...
{a:c:
*giggle*giggle*,
 ......ehehehehahahaha......
Ahahahahahahahahahaha......}
Listening to that voiceless laugh, I finally slammed my hands against the wall, crying tears of frustration.
"Please, just stop it...!!
 Why do you always hide my things and get me in trouble?!"
The witch answers.
Fool.
 ......Isn\'t it obvious?
Why else, except to entertain myself by watching you wander about pointlessly?
 *cackle*cackle*, hyahhahahahahahahahhahhahha...!!
I felt so frustrated.
 I knew all along that that was the reason, but the witch being so blatant about it was incredibly annoying.
I can tell.
 That small broom {i:is} somewhere in this chapel.
No, that\'s not quite it.
 Until the very moment I walked up to this window, I\'m sure it was right by this window frame.
That\'s right, I\'m sure I put it right here by this window.
But the prankster witch {f:5:Beatrice} uses her magic,
 and just before I reach this spot, she instantly teleports the small broom to the next window over.
The instant I approach the next window,
 a hole appears beneath the small broom, swallowing it up.
And it comes out by the next window after that.
It lands right there, perfectly still, as though it was there the whole time.
And this happens over and over again!
As I run up to one window, the small broom falls into a magic hole and goes to the next window.
 And when I go to that window, it goes to the next window...!
That\'s exactly how she\'s teasing me, I can tell!
So no matter how much I search, it\'ll be useless.
But if I stop searching, it\'ll be just sitting there by one window or another.
So, this isn\'t a search.
 It\'s a test of endurance.
I keep chasing after the small broom,
 and {f:5:Beatrice} keeps making it escape to the next window over, trying to make me give up.
This is an eternal chase...that\'ll end only when one of us gives up...!
So, I keep going around in circles searching the windows, even when I know I\'ve already searched them.
If it\'s not by this one, then the next one, and the next one.
And the witch keeps moving the small broom to the next window, and the next one...!
"Just give it a rest...!!
 How long are you going to make fun of me?
 This isn\'t the only time, you always do this, always!!"
{a:c:
*giggle*,
 heh
heh
hah
hahahahahahahahahaha}...!!
The shrill, voiceless{FIXME?} laugh of the formless witch continues to mock my sobbing.
The witch is right beside me, laughing at me.
As I dash around the chapel, she\'s following along with me, taunting me.
Then...
she must be...
there.
She\'s right behind me, ......just over my shoulder,
 cackling away at this very moment.
I know that turning around won\'t help, since she has no form.
I can try to look, but I mustn\'t look with my eyes.
Once my eyes tell me there\'s nothing there, I won\'t be able to {i:{y:1:‘see’}{n:1:"see"}} anymore.
I learned that from the Director of the Gospel House.
 ......You mustn\'t try to {y:1:see}{n:1:look} with your real eyes.
 ......You must {y:1:‘see’}{n:1:{i:see}} with your {i:mind\'s} eye.
The whole world is filled with God\'s love.
 In the many blessings of everyday life, one can find God, and angels, and the Holy Ghost.
{y:1:If you try to look at them with your eyes, you won\'t be able to see them {i:or} ‘see’ them.}{n:1:If you look with your eyes, you won\'t be able to see them.}
 So you won\'t be able to feel them or understand them.
Instead, you must quietly understand them with the eye of your heart.
You don\'t look and have your eyes reflect their image.
You {y:1:‘see’}{n:1:"see"}...and picture them in your mind.
In this way, I learned how to recognize beings not of this world at the Gospel House.
......This power doesn\'t only allow you to {y:1:‘see’}{n:1:"see"} God.
It allows you to {y:1:‘see’}{n:1:"see"} {i:all} those not of this world.
".........Please, stop it now.
 Stop this prank."
"...............Hoh.
 ......So, you can speak to me?"
"I\'m clumsy, bad at my job, ......and I do forget where I put things a lot.
 ......But I know which things were my fault, and which things were because of your pranks."
"How amusing...
 Not only can you perceive me in my formless state, but you even understand my little game.
 .........It seems you are a more interesting creature than I thought,
 Yasu."
......I\'m usually called Yasu when one of the older servants is laughing behind my back at some mistake I\'ve made.
So, when I hear that name, it feels bad.
She deliberately called me not by the blessed name given to me by the Gospel House, but by that unblessed name.
Upsetting the heart is a classic move for evil beings to make.
That is their way of attempting to prevent others from perceiving them.
To beings like witches, being understood is like shoving them out into the light of day.
"......It won\'t work.
 In the Gospel House, I learned how to perceive those not of this world.
 So, I already understand you."
"Very interesting.
 ............I am a being so faint that I would scatter in a gentle breeze, yet you hold me in the grasp of your perception.
 ......I have taken a liking to you, {i:Yasu}!"
"It won\'t work.
 I understand you now, and you\'re in my grasp.
 No matter how many unpleasant things you say, you\'ll just expose the ugliness of your heart."
Without turning around, ......I slowly let my field of vision fill the entire chapel.
It was as though the viewpoint of my soul was floating out from the shell of my head.
......See,
 ............inch by inch,
 ......my field of vision is floating out of my head...
...and drifting upwards.
As I looked down at myself, standing there with head hanging and eyes tightly shut...
...my mind\'s eye...
...very slowly...
......rose up to the ceiling of the chapel.
And when I looked down from there...
...I looked down at myself, standing in the center of the chapel, .........and the witch standing behind me.
......Apparently, the witch realized that she was being {y:1:‘seen’}{n:1:seen}.
She turned around...
......and raised her eyes to look at my mind\'s eye, floating by the ceiling...
......At last,
 I could {y:1:‘see’}{n:1:see} the witch {f:5:Beatrice}...
...with my mind\'s eye......
"A mere {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}...
...grasped my form......?"
The demonic lips......twisted in an ugly curve.
It was clearly a challenging, repulsive, ......demon\'s smile...
She wore a blood‐red dress and hat.
 The design was completely different from anything {y:0:Humans}{n:0:humans} wore.
Her hair was blonde.
 It had countless beautiful curls, like a princess from a picture book,
 ......but there was no trace of cuteness about her.
"......I thought you were a little different from the other {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s,
 but it seems I was mistaken."
"........................"
"You are not just a little different......you are {i:entirely} different from other {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s.
 *cackle*cackle*...!"
"You sad witch, who can be seen by no one, heard by no one.
 ......Have you been pulling these pranks all the time just to catch the attention of {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s...?"
"I use what little magic I have to interfere when {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s aren\'t looking, but no matter what I do, none of them think of it as magic.
 ......They decide that they just made a little mistake,
 and blow my existence away like the candles on a cake."
"If so, then I\'ve just saved you.
 Because I understand you...and perceive you."
"......Saved me?
 *cackle*cackle*cackle*!
 To me, this meeting with you is nothing more than a new way to kill time."
"It\'s getting dark.
 I don\'t have the time to play with you anymore."
"Well, well, so it is.
 My apologies. When one is engrossed, one hardly notices the time."
".........Please give it back.
 My cleaning tool."
"That small broom, or whatever you call it?
 It\'s right there, by the next window."
"But as soon as I get close, you\'ll move it to the next window over."
"*cackle*cackle*!
 My magic is as elusive as my very own form.
 With no more than a snap of my fingers, everything here is under my total control...!"
The witch snapped her fingers, and various things throughout the chapel were sucked into black pitfalls beneath them, disappearing.
No, they didn\'t disappear.
 The instant they vanished into the dark holes, other dark holes appeared in completely different parts of the chapel, and the vanished objects fell out of those.
Chairs, musical scores, clocks, and vases started appearing and disappearing all across the room.
I felt as though countless tools were flying about the chapel......
"I can perform these acts, but I choose not to.
 After all, this would be a bit more than a prank, don\'t you agree...?"
I wonder where a witch draws the line between pranks and magic.
When she snapped her fingers again, all of the objects flying about so energetically returned to their original spots,
 and silence fell.
"I\'ve taken a liking to you.
 ......You say you have me in your grasp?
 *cackle*cackle*!
 That works in reverse.
 I have you in mine."
".............................."
The Gospel Director told me that I mustn\'t try to {y:1:‘see’}{n:1:"see"} evil beings.
If you {y:1:‘see’}{n:1:"see"} them, they will haunt you.
Now that I understood this witch, a bond had been formed between us.
"That is correct.
 Now that you have acknowledged my existence, I have formed a bond with you.
 ......After all the years I have spent in boredom, it will be nice to have someone to talk to, even a child as young as you."
"I\'ll talk to you from time to time.
 So, will you stop pulling pranks like this?"
"No, I won\'t be here to talk to you, but to play with you!
 *cackle*cackle*. And if we\'re playing, pranks are just part of the game, right?"
"................................."
"Heheh.
 ......Very well.
 I\'ve had enough fun for one day.
 The sun has sunk and the moon is full.
 I am tired after appearing in front of you for so long.
 Let us call it a night.
 That single broom provided me a great deal of entertainment...!"
"Please, give it back."
"No.
 I will keep this as a token of our meeting.
 I assume that you will be fine with this?"
"......If I said I\'m not, would you give it back to me?"
"I never listen to {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s!
 .........However, I might lend an ear to a friend."
"......If you give it back, ......I\'ll acknowledge you as a friend."
"*cackle*cackle*cackle*...!
 Foolish {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}, was that your idea of an attractive proposal...?!
 ......If you want to make a deal with me, try drawing a mysterious magic circle or two!
 .........And yet, I might be willing to consider your offer."
"What do you mean, you might...?"
"I shall take my time in deciding whether you are worthy to be my friend.
 ......After all, witches are like demons!
 If you ask us for an answer, we will never give one right away.
 *cackle*cackle*!"
".........Alright.
 Then, .........I\'ll leave the small broom with you.
 Please give it back when you decide to become my friend."
"Very well.
 Will this broom become a bridge of friendship between us, or not?
 ......I will hang onto it for now, making my decision in my own good time."
When the witch snapped her fingers, the broom for which I had searched so long fell out of a hole in the air,
 landing between the fingers she had just snapped...
"This is goodbye.
 ......This game with you was far from boring.
 Let us play again sometime."
"If you\'re my friend, that is."
"When a cat toys with a mouse, does it try to become friends with it first?
 *cackle*cackle*, ahahahahahahahahahaa!!"
The witch faded away......
As she did, my mind\'s eye slowly closed......
When I returned to my body, I felt suddenly tired and let out the breath I\'d been holding.
......Of course, when I turned around, there was no one to be seen.
I couldn\'t feel the witch\'s presence anywhere anymore.
It had gotten very dark by this time.
I decided to leave the chapel.
There\'s no point in searching for the small broom any longer.
......Not until the witch decides to give it back.
I went out of the chapel.
The chapel key had been left in the lock.
I used it to lock the door.
............What am I going to do about the small broom?
There\'s nothing I can do.
 I can\'t even blame the witch.
I must acknowledge that I\'m responsible for giving the witch a chance...
"..............................nn—"
I happened to glance downwards......and saw a small broom lying there by my feet.
It was the broom I had been searching for all this time.
......Don\'t tell me...
that it\'ll be swallowed up by a dark hole the instant I bend over to pick it up...?
No.
 This is...a sign from the witch.
A sign that she acknowledges me as a friend.
I picked it up.
Oh, I am one yet many.
"The first friend I made after coming to the island was apparently not a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} at all.
 However, when I think back on it, it was only natural.
 What other sort of friend would you expect to make on a witch\'s island?
 This was the first meeting between me and {f:5:Beatrice}."
"......However, as the more perceptive among you may have noticed, this was not a meeting with the real {f:5:Beatrice}.
 The witch I then called {f:5:Beatrice} would later be known by another name."
"......However, the fact remains that she was clearly not human.
 And being bonded with one who is not human means being bonded with their world.
 I still had no means of knowing the strange fate that awaited me on Rokkenjima......"
