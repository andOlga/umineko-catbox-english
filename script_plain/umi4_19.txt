The world whitened......
It wasn\'t "white".
 ...It was the blindingly bright color of gold.
That place......was the beautiful Ushiromiya family rose garden.
However, the roses were all gold.
......The nectar was also golden.
 The butterflies gathering there were gold as well.
............This is...the Golden Land............
The promised land that the witches of Mariage Sorcière would ultimately be guided to...
There, all wishes come true, and all magic and dreams come into being.
............In that garden of gold roses...
............were two, and only two, witches.
At my uninvited appearance,
 the atmosphere trembled with unrest.
.........What was to them an ominous wind shook the golden roses.
The incredibly beautiful scene formed by the golden rose petals scattering in the wind...
was, without a doubt, something not of this world......
The two who had been taking a walk through the golden roses noticed me and reacted in surprise.
"......Ange......?
 .........Beato, it\'s Ange......!!"
"...............How did you get here...?
 .........Leave us alone.
 I no longer invite anyone here."
Beato spoke coldly.
 .........She seemed like a completely different person from the boldly sneering woman she had once been.
She had closed off her heart, and shut herself up in a world where she was alone with Maria onee‐chan.
A world where she could always be alone with friendly Maria onee‐chan,
 conversing about magic while drinking tea.
......No one to hurry them, and nothing to hold them back.
A world where not a single person who might hurt them existed.
Yes, to the two of them, that was a small and complete universe......
".........Sorry.
 ......I can\'t have you shutting yourself up in here.
 .........The game won\'t move on unless you come back."
"I said I was tired of it and I\'m done with it.
 I will not return to the game anymore."
"...............Beato is going to be here all the time with me.
 We\'ll drink tea here together, and think of lots of ways to play...!
 You can play with us too, Ange."
"......MARIA.
 We decided against that.
 As long as I have you, I am satisfied.
 Tell me that you too are satisfied as long as you have me."
".....................
 ......Yeah.
 ......Thank you.
 The only person who needs me that much is you, Beato.
 So I\'ll be with you.
 Just us is enough."
".........MARIA...... ......Thank you......
 ............I am grateful........."
Beato held Maria tight,
 even creating a small, warm universe within their joined arms...
.........It was probably the birth of the smallest universe in the world.
...The smallest universe in the world, which a pair who needed each other could create...
No matter how small it was, that world was complete.
............But I have to tear it apart.
.....................
"......Sorry,
 .........but I can\'t let things be that way.
 I came to smash this Golden Land of Mariage Sorcière."
"............Why...
...would you break...
...my world.........?
 Wh‐who has this world inconvenienced, outside Maria and myself......?!"
"This game that you started, and then walked away from without finishing,
 is keeping Onii‐chan waiting forever!
 If you don\'t return to your seat, the match will never end...!!"
".........Hahahahaha...ha...!
 There is no longer even a single player in that game.
 Battler vanished, and I came here and vanished as well.
 That game is already over."
"It is not over!
 You started that game, didn\'t you?!!
 Take proper responsibility and see it through to the very end!"
"Either defeat Battler, and give birth to the world you truly wished for,
 or be defeated and release everything swallowed up by your magic!!
 Take responsibility until the very end!!"
"...............Don\'t, Ange.
 Beato will spend her time in this world with me, just the two of us together for eternity.
 ......And I don\'t need anything else either, as long as I have Beato.
 ......All wishes come true here.
 Everything is here."
............This Golden Land is made up of nothing more than the crystallization of Maria onee‐chan and BEATRICE\'s thoughts and feelings.
......To drag Beato out of this world,
 ......I have to...
...destroy it.........
..................Destroy this Golden Land,
 .........which must be the final world of peace for BEATRICE......
"Onee‐chan. That\'s wrong.
 This Golden Land is a liar.
 It hasn\'t granted the one wish you truly wanted to come true."
".........That\'s not true!!
 Everything is granted here!
 Look, there\'s even a nice Mama here!!"
Gold butterflies gathered behind Maria,
 forming into a kindly smiling Aunt Rosa.
.........And after smiling sweetly at me,
 she softly became golden petals and crumbled.
"Anything can be created here.
 Even you can be, and Battler, and George onii‐chan, and Jessica onee‐chan...!!
 You can summon as many as you want, and everyone is nice...!!
 You come too, Ange, let\'s play together......!!"
............Sorry, Onee‐chan............
"And what about Sakutarou......?"
".........—"
Upon hearing Sakutarou\'s name, Onee‐chan\'s face looked like she was choking.
"Stop it......
 Do not speak that name......"
Beato\'s expression changed as well.
And she put her arm around Maria, hugging her as if to protect her.
.........Sakutarou\'s name was still taboo for Onee‐chan.
"Why can\'t I say it?
 It\'s the name of Maria onee‐chan\'s best friend."
"......Why won\'t you invite that close friend to this wonderful Golden Land?
 Why, in this Golden Land where all wishes come true, is Sakutarou the only one you can\'t summon?"
"Th‐...that\'s because......
 ......It\'s alright, MARIA.
 You don\'t have to remember Sakutarou—"
"............Sakutaro was killed by Mama!!!!"
Maria onee‐chan flew into a rage with a terrible expression on her face.
Surprised by that voice, butterflies flew up throughout the garden,
 ......blowing around like a typhoon of flower petals.
"Yes, I know.
 Aunt Rosa......took your precious stuffed animal Sakutarou, and tore him apart......!!"
"GYAAAAAAAaaaAAAAAAAAAAaAAAaaAAHHHH!!!"
Maria\'s scream became a storm and violently scattered the golden petals and leaves.
It was truly a storm of gold.
"Stop...!!
 Stop stop stop...!!!
 Why are you trying to reopen the wound in MARIA\'s heart...?!
 Don\'t defile the sleep of a dear friend precious to both Maria and myself...!!"
"In that case, why won\'t you revive that precious friend for her with your magic?"
"I would have if I could...!!
 But that stuffed animal was an article Rosa created herself!
 The magical meaning of that unique object being torn apart is—"
"You aren\'t fooling anyone.
 Why can\'t you revive Sakutarou?
 There\'s only one answer.
 It\'s because you aren\'t a real witch!"
".........I most certainly can revive him...!!
 With my magic, I can revive him as often as I want, like this!!"
"I could even bury this garden in Sakutarous...!!"
"Yeah, I\'ll bet you could, with your magic!
 But Onee‐chan definitely wouldn\'t be able to see the Sakutarous you create!"
"............You know why, right?
 I\'ll say it again.
 It\'s because you aren\'t a real witch...!!"
"Stop iiiiiiiiiit!!
 Why do you keep saying such mean things, Ange...?!
 Beato can use a lot of magic...!
 She\'s a very wonderful witch...!!"
"Sakutaro was the one thing she couldn\'t revive, ......but she can do anything else...!!
 So I can......put up with...
not having Sakutaro......"
"No, Onee‐chan, that\'s wrong.
 .........There\'s nothing a witch can\'t do.
 As soon as she couldn\'t do that,
 BEATRICE was not a real witch."
"Tha‐that\'s wrong......!!
 It\'s because Sakutaro\'s stuffed animal vessel was something Mama made by hand herself, and—"
"And that\'s why she can\'t revive him?
 Is BEATRICE\'s... Is your magic that inconvenient?"
"Gah, .........i‐......in that case, ......do you claim that you can revive Sakutarou?!
 Can you do that with your magic?!"
"I can."
".........What........."
"Maria onee‐chan!!
 I\'ll show you some real magic.
 I\'ll revive Sakutarou for you!!"
"......Re‐
.........really......?
 Even BEATRICE couldn\'t do it, you know......?
 ...Ca‐
.........can you really......?!"
"Yes, I can!
 In exchange, promise me.
 Once I\'ve revived Sakutarou..."
"Yes...!"
"Leave this Golden Land."
"............!"
"I, I will not permit that...!!
 This world is MARIA\'s and mine together!!
 If MARIA leaves,
 ......it will break...!!"
The minimum amount of Humans it takes to create a universe is two.
If that breaks down, the world is destroyed.
To drag out the witch who shut herself away in the Golden Land, I have to destroy this world...!
"......Yes, and that is the proof that you are not a witch.
 ......A real witch can create a universe alone."
"The Mariage Sorcière Alliance of Witches!
 ......The very existence of this alliance proves that you are not a witch...!!"
"N‐no...!!
 I will not give up MARIA...!!
 I hate you, leave right now...!!
 Get out of heeeeeeeeeere!!"
"Dragging everyone into a game of your own accord, then getting bored and chasing them out when your mood changes!!
 How selfish can you be?"
"Watch and learn, BEATRICE!!
 And you, Maria onee‐chan!!
 This...is true magic.........!!!"
"Ca‐......can you really revive Sakutaro...?!"
"There\'s no way!!
 This is a Golden Land for Maria and me alone...!
 There is not a single piece of magic that an outsider like you could use here!
 As you are now, you couldn\'t even create a single butterfly!!"
"Be quiet, Beato!!
 Don\'t get in Ange\'s way...!!"
When Maria yelled,
 ......the storm abruptly stopped, and the area returned to silence.
.........As the massive amount of golden petals that had been blown upwards quietly drifted down,
 ......that scene looked so fantastical, as though a golden snow was falling......
Maria, thinking about this unlikely, if‐only miracle,
 unconsciously joined her hands together as though praying.
......Beato\'s heart raced as she watched Maria do this.
.........If the extremely unlikely were to happen,
 ...Maria would,
 ......this world would......
But......it\'s inconceivable......!
 An absolute impossibility...
That stuffed animal, the only one of its kind in the world, was torn apart and thrown away,
 and not a thread remained.
Reviving it is an absolutely certain impossibility......!!
This is my Golden Land...!
A world where magic that isn\'t mine certainly cannot exist!!!
"G‐
......go right ahead,
 ......I defy you to do it, Ushiromiya Angeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!"
At Beato\'s scream, the world lost its sound.
I slowly...recited the incantation...for true magic......
"...............Come, try to remember.
 Maria\'s close friend Sakutarou."
".........Try to remember what form you had."
".........Try to remember what a lovable stuffed animal you were."
"Huh, ..................ah, ...ah........."
"....................................!"
......Expressions of shock rose to both of their faces.
Then, ......pushing Beato\'s elbow aside, Maria dashed forward......
".........kutaro.........
 .........Sakutarooo.........!!"
Then,
 ............she threw her arms around him and me both.
"......It\'s alright.
 Sakutarou...won\'t disappear.
 ............
 ‘Uryu,
 Maria. I\'m back.’"
"Sakutaro,
 ......Sakutaro......
 ......uuuuuuuuuuuuuuu,
 waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaauuuuu!!
 Sakutarooooooo......
 I missed you......
...so much..............."
It was, unmistakably,
 .........that lion,
 ......that Sakutarou stuffed animal.
Maria had forgotten its softness, its texture, its stitches,
 .........its everything.
But,
 .........the instant she hugged the stuffed animal, everything came back to her vividly......
‘Uryu.
 Maria,
 ......I\'m back.’
"Sakutaro, Sakutaro...!!
 Is your body alright?
 You aren\'t hurting anywhere?
 Even though something so......horrible was done to you, you\'re alright everywhere......?!"
‘Uryu...!
 Ange revived me with magic, so I\'m perfectly fine...!’
"I\'m so glad......
 I\'m so glad......
 Welcome back, Sakutaro......
uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu!!"
‘I\'ll always be with you from now on, Maria.
 Together forever.
 ......So don\'t...
let go of me, okay.........?’
"Yeah, ......won\'t let go......
 ......Never ever....................."
Then, still hugging Sakutarou,
 she looked up at me with tear‐filled eyes...
"......Thank you, Ange...!
 .........Your magic is amazing......
 ......Why?
 Why were you able to revive Sakutarou?!
 Even Beato couldn\'t do it...!"
"..................Impossible...
 ......Impossible......
 ......How?
 ......How can a human other than me use magic in my Golden Land?!?!
 This is...
......completely impossible.........!"
"What are you so flustered about, BEATRICE?
 ..................This is...magic, right?"
"It cannot possibly be magic...!!
 
This is my Golden Land!!
 
A world where magic that isn\'t mine certainly cannot exist!!
 And my
 
magic was not able to revive Sakutarou...!!"
"There\'s no way it could!!
 
That stuffed animal was a special stuffed animal!
 
Rosa made it for her daughter\'s birthday, and in the entire world, only one of its kind—
.........—
...............u...
...............hh......"
".....................See,
 ...it\'s magic, right?"
"Ah...
......oh......
......ahh...
.........aaahhh,
 .........aah...h...hh...hhhh......"
With this miracle that she could not possibly accept,
 .........Beato...understood all of my magic......
And she looked at Maria and Sakutarou innocently frolicking around,
 ......looked at me,
 .........and then...
......fell to her knees,
 ......with even her hands pressed to the ground,
 ...............and cried.
"BEATRICE...! This is really magic, right...?!
 It\'s magic, right?!
 BEATRICE...!!!"
"...............Mm.........
 ......It is magic......
 ......That is...
......true...
......magic........."
"How can Ange use a magic that even Beato can\'t do?!
 How?!
 How?!
 Ange\'s awesome, Ange\'s an awesome witch!
 A real witch who\'s much, much more amazing than me......!!!"
"Yes, that\'s right, Onee‐chan.
 ...............I am the Witch of Resurrection, ANGE.
 ......There is nothing that cannot be revived by me."
"Oh wow, oh wow!!
 Even Beato said that the magic of resurrection was the hardest!!
 ANGE, you\'re awesome!!
 A real real Great Witch......!!!"
At that moment, Maria\'s and Sakutarou\'s forms flashed gold,
 ......and the two became golden flower petals, and crumbled away......
As the two became a golden wind and swirled together,
 .........they left for some other place of peace.
Beato had, ......as promised, banished Maria from the Golden Land.
"......Goodbye, ...Maria onee‐chan.
 And be happy forever.
 ............It\'s alright, I\'m sure "you" exist in Onee‐chan\'s world as well.
 But that doesn\'t refer to you."
"...............I am happy for you,
 ......Maria......
 ......As your close friend,
 .........I celebrate this reunion...from the bottom of my heart........."
On Beato\'s face......was a mixture of what was probably every expression a human could muster.
That expression—
it was joy,
 it was anger,
 it was sadness.
".........That is the basis of magic, isn\'t it.
 ............Without love,
 without sadness,
 without anger,
 ............magic cannot be ‘seen’."
The ground shook.
 ......An earthquake.
.........It gradually caused greater and greater fissures,
 and began to tear BEATRICE\'s final paradise apart.
Golden butterflies fluttered about trying to escape, but there was nowhere to escape to.
...Nor for BEATRICE.
The Golden Land began to crumble away.
The earth gave way like a floor falling through,
 .........and BEATRICE was sucked into the depths of a jet‐black darkness.
Then, she was mercilessly slammed against a jet‐black floor.
......It was a small, nondescript, and very dimly lit smoking room.
There was no door to exit by, and while there were windows,
 ......they let no light into this place—BEATRICE\'s smoking room.
Even as Beato moaned from the pain of being slammed against that cold hard floor,
 she shakily rose to her feet......
A seat was there.
......And the game table, ......still just as it had been when she had left it.
The game board, too, was preserved in the same state in which Beato had abandoned it.
"That is your seat.
 Sit."
"...............So, this is the only seat...
......for me to sit in........."
Beato put a hand against her own seat, ......and laughed sadly.
"Win, or lose.
 That is all you are given.
 A tie during the process of reaching that point will probably be permitted."
".........But the one thing I will not allow is for you to suspend the game and throw it away!
 Either win and survive, or lose and disappear!
 Until one of those two things happens, you will not be permitted to rise from that chair!!"
"Isn\'t that your only duty as the host of a witch\'s game, as the Golden Witch BEATRICE...?!!"
Laughing weakly, Beato...
...sat down.
......Then she rested her elbows on the table, covered her face with both hands,
 .........and managed to put together a smile with just her mouth.
".........Not permitted to escape an unwinnable game.
 .........Very well, then.
 ......Why don\'t I repeat this......until I lose......"
"Spare me the pity show!
 Win.
 Use the very best moves you have...!!
 You started this game!
 You have a duty to make the best moves possible!!
 Enough with all this indecisive fooling around!"
Just then, there was a heavy sound.
......Beato felt a cold and pitiful sensation on her leg.
"......Gotcha...!
 I finally got you, eh, Beato~?"
"Oh, if it isn\'t the great Lady LAMBDADELTA...
 .........To think that you were still here."
Beato\'s foot was locked in an ice‐cold steel shackle,
 ......fastening her to the chair she sat in.
......She would no longer be able to escape from this seat.
"Oh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho!
 You won\'t be able to escape anymore, got it?
 I\'m more persistent than I look. Surprising, huh?"
"............I\'m more surprised that you weren\'t already aware of it."
"You are not permitted to leave early or suspend the game.
 You\'ll fight for all eternity, in order to win, of course.
 .........You don\'t want to lose, right?
 You wanna little peek at the kind of wonderful world you\'ll be thrown into if you loooose?"
"Don\'t worry...
 You can win... Until you do, I, the great Lady LAMBDADELTA, will stick right by you and look after you for all eternity...!!"
".................................
 ......Hmph, ......hahahahaha.
 .........But even if I wish to fight, I have no opponent across from me, correct......?"
".........It\'s alright, I\'ve found Battler."
When BERNKASTEL appeared and clapped her hands,
 Battler appeared from the sky and plopped into the opposite chair.
Battler\'s eyes were slightly opened, but there was no sparkle in them, almost like a doll.
Without the one pillar that established his soul,
 ............he had fallen into the very depths of darkness, and had been drifting about all this time.
......By rights, he should have dispersed and vanished like mist.
BERNKASTEL had managed to scrape him together.
It was surprising that she had managed to bring him back into a human form.
However, even though his body had returned, his soul had not.
......It was blown away when his existence was denied by BEATRICE.
It wouldn\'t come back easily.
"...............Battler won\'t run from this fight either.
 Not until he beats you.
 ......We won\'t permit such boorishness as to throw everything away and run just because the chances of winning have grown slim."
"Not even he himself wants that.
 ............Right, Ushiromiya Battler...?"
Battler didn\'t answer.
 ......His heart was still...dead.
His eyes wavered slightly at the question, but he couldn\'t answer.
"Battler...!
 Get ahold of yourself!
 You are here.
 And the enemy is before your eyes...!
 Fight!
 Fight to win!!"
Battler lazily and incoherently parroted her words.
.........He was back.
But the trauma inflicted on his soul was no small thing.
That was only natural.
BEATRICE had woven her red, and he had been denied.
He had learned that the mother he had respected was not his birth mother,
 .........and he didn\'t know who he was.
......I am not...
...Ushiromiya Battler............
"Don\'t talk stupid!
 You are Ushiromiya Battler and no one else!"
"No matter who else admits that or denies that, make sure you believe it yourself...!!
 You are the only one who can create your own world, you know.
 Don\'t lose the world where you are Ushiromiya Battler!"
"...............Then,
 ............who...
...am I.........?
 I\'m not Mom\'s kid......
 Where was I born from......?"
Battler asked while gazing lazily up at the ceiling, with eyes that still hadn\'t regained their sparkle.
Of course, she answered right away.
"Yes, that\'s true.
 Beato declared it with the red truth.
 ......So I\'ll declare it too.
 
Ushiromiya Battler is not Ushiromiya Asumu\'s son."
".........Hmph, ......in that case, he is not qualified to be the opponent in my game, is he..."
"Repetition request for BEATRICE.
 "Ushiromiya Battler is not Ushiromiya Kinzo\'s grandchild"."
".............................."
As Beato wrinkled her forehead,
 ......a pained smile rose to her face.
"Declining to repeat, I see.
 Beato declared two red truths:
 "
You are not Asumu\'s son",
 and
 "
No one except Kinzo\'s grandchild Battler is qualified to be her opponent"."
"The following theory will see you accepted as qualified without any contradictions.
 This is my blue truth—listen to this...!"
The one who is qualified to be Beato\'s opponent is "Kinzo\'s grandchild, Ushiromiya Battler",
 and whether that person is "Asumu\'s son" or not is not an issue.
In other words, you can be Kinzo\'s grandchild even if you are not Asumu\'s son.
As long as you are Rudolf\'s son!
"Hmph, what a stupid word game."
"...............Blue truth, valid.
 Beato, your counterargument with the red truth?
 If you cannot counter it with the red truth, there is no problem with Battler\'s qualifications as an opponent."
"................................."
.........Battler was still out of it.
He still couldn\'t really understand what she was saying for him.
......But even so, his spirit was starting to come back bit by bit...
"..................Then,
 ............who...
......am I......?"
"Get ahold of yourself!
 You are Ushiromiya Battler!
 Yeah, maybe Asumu okaa‐san didn\'t give birth to you.
 But so what?!
 That doesn\'t change in the slightest the fact that she was a mother to you, right?!"
".........For example, what is Ushiromiya Ange to you?
 You might not share the same blood, but she\'s still your little sister, right?!
 It\'s not about blood, it\'s about bonds, isn\'t it?!"
"............Well...yeah......
 ......Even though we don\'t share the same blood, ......Ange is...
......my little sister."
"Say it in red!
 Say that Ange is your little sister!!"
".........
Ange is......my little sister.
 .........ah, ............it worked."
She hugged Battler, who was still out of it and slumped in his chair, strongly from behind.
 So strongly that it hurt.
"I don\'t know why Asumu okaa‐san wasn\'t your birth mother.
 But still, until today you believed that she was your mother, and you still do, right?!
 In this world, there are plenty of people without even a mother,
 ......without even a family!!"
"Did Asumu okaa‐san ever let you feel lonely?
 Never, right?!
 Don\'t throw your peaceful family away so easily!!
 Your family bonds have gotten way too thin after leaving your family for six years!!"
"You have to feel those family bonds much, much more strongly!
 Remember!!
 For Asumu okaa‐san\'s sake, don\'t lose your affection because of some stupid ravings from a witch!"
"...........................
 .........You\'re right......
 ......Mom was......always on my side......"
"...............Where is this place......?
 ......It\'s dark......
 ......I wanna go home......
 Where\'s...
all of my...
...family.........?"
The light still hadn\'t returned to Battler\'s eyes.
But......tears formed there.
"Your little sister is waiting at home for you to come back.
 She needs you at least to come back, ......or she\'ll be all alone forever...!
 For your little sister\'s sake if nothing else, please win this witch\'s game...!!"
"............Ange......
 My...
...little sister.........
 ......But the thing is...
......I don\'t know anymore...
 .........Why do I...
have to keep repeating this incomprehensible, cruel game with Beato forever......?
 ......I\'ve...
...had enough........."
"In that case, hurry up and finish off this game and go back home!!
 Ushiromiya Battler, how long are you going to play around in a place like this?!
 Your little sister is waiting for you to come home!!!"
.........That\'s right.
Battler was caught up in this strange game before he even knew it.
And, unable to understand what he was fighting for,
 he was taken along at the witch\'s pace, toyed with and made to fight, for a very long time.
That should have been the simplest and first question.
......Not understanding that is why he loses his purpose for fighting...!!
It\'s why my voice doesn\'t reach his ears...!
What he needs is not some vague purpose, like winning against the witch, or because she\'s unforgivable.
......He needs to become aware of a purpose for which he must win.
".........That\'s right......
 ......I want to go home......
 ......To Mom and Dad,
 ......and Ange......
 .........I\'ve had enough,
 ......enough of this place......
 ......I\'ve had enough of witches, I\'ve had enough of games and murders......
......enough,
 enough......"
"Battler\'s soul...is starting to come back."
"...............But it can\'t quite reach."
"You\'ve had enough, right?!
 Then fight so you can return to your family!!
 Destroy BEATRICE and come home!!"
"No, ......no more witches...!
 Enough of Beato, ...enough of everything...and you too, you\'re probably just another one of the witch\'s allies...
 I could be betrayed again at any time...!!"
"
I can\'t trust anything, I can\'t trust any words that aren\'t red...!!
 Leave me alone, leave me aloooooooooone!!"
Battler\'s soul howled.
 She hugged his head from behind, so tightly that it hurt.
"
Hurry up and come home, Onii‐chan!!
 
Don\'t leave me all alone!!!"
"...............Huh......?
 .........Who...
...............are you......?"
"
It\'s me, it\'s Ange...!!
 
No one\'s coming back home, Onii‐chan, not you, not Mom, not Dad!!
 
I\'m so lonely!!
 
Please, hurry up and come home!"
"......A‐.........Ange......
 .........So you were.........Ange............"
"
That\'s right, I\'m Ange!!
 
The Ushiromiya Ange of a world where no one comes home...!!
 .........
My entire family...never came home from Rokkenjima that day...!!"
"
The witch before your eyes stole away my whole family, even you...!
 .........
Only you can finish her, Onii‐chan!!
 
Finish her...!!"
"
And take your family back!!
 
And then.........come home to me......!!!"
"...............Beato stole...
...my family........."
"......Hmph, ............as she says.
 I will not run away or hide from it.
 ......I stole Ushiromiya Ange\'s family away from her."
"Battler is my toy!
 His father and mother too, all of them are my toys.
 ......I won\'t give them back to you.
 ......You may continue to wander alone forever, awaiting the return of your family that is never to be......!"
From Ange\'s arms that held him, ............the very painful, sad, and lonely days...
...that his little sister, left all alone, had gone through...flowed into Battler......
......Because he had been playing around in a place like this,
 ............his little sister had been left all alone, .........and had been forced to endure...
.........such painful days...............!!
"...Ange, .........Ange.........!!
 Shit, ......I\'ve, .........what have I been doing.........?!!
 Thanks a bunch, Ange...
 Onii‐chan......has been forgetting something important this whole time......!"
Battler tried to turn around,
 but Ange was clutching his head with an incredible force, so he couldn\'t.
......Sweat?
Hot drops splashed the back of Battler\'s neck.
......What they were...he discovered by holding Ange\'s arm as she clung to him.
.........Because it stained Battler\'s hand...his fingers...red.
".........Blood...
 ......A‐Ange?!
 A‐are you alright?!
 H‐hey......?!"
It dripped and splashed.
He didn\'t know what was going on.
Battler couldn\'t tell for sure because he couldn\'t turn around,
 but the hot drops staining his entire back were surely......blood.
"............In order to save you, Onii‐chan,
 in order to come here,
 there was a single rule that I wasn\'t allowed to...
...break...
 .........This...
.........was it.
 .........Letting you...
......find out...
...that I was...
...Ange........."
......It was so hard.........
My onii‐chan was right before my eyes, ......and I couldn\'t even tell him.........
If I\'d just followed the rule, ......I would have been able to stay by your side forever.
.........You and me together...
...playing the game against the witch...
...for eternity......
"But...
......that\'s no good."
"............Onii‐
......ah...
.........chan,
 ......you have to go back."
".........Back home,
 ......your sister is waiting for you......"
".........That person isn\'t me,
 ............but this way, your sister...
will find her salvation........."
"Ange?!
 Ange!!
 There\'s so much blood...!!
 So much, so much!!"
He wanted to turn around, but he couldn\'t because of how tightly Ange was gripping his head.
However, judging by the blood that was pouring out and Ange\'s pained breathing,
 he realized that something seriously wrong was happening to her right now.
"............Don\'t...worry.........
 ......I am just......a piece......
 .........You know, in chess, ......they have this thing called a <sacrifice>......"
"Sacri—......what?!
 Who cares about that!!
 Let\'s get you some first‐aid quickly!!
 Let go for a second, Ange...!!"
".........A <sacrifice>...is a thrown piece.
 For the sake of the strategic vision, you intentionally let a piece go, in full awareness of the loss..."
The ultimate goal in chess is victory against the opponent.
......So sacrificing a few individual pieces is no problem if that can bring you to victory in the end.
Ange had made a levelheaded decision.
.........She had been told over and over again that she was a piece, not a player.
......In order to act like a piece and save Battler, right now, she herself needed to become a sacrificial piece.
............Battler had to be made aware.
His purpose in playing this witch\'s game must not be something abstract like finishing off the witch.
He needs to win the game, he needs to release himself, and he needs to bring his family back home.
Why?
 .........Because he has family—a little sister—waiting for him to come home.
A being created to bring Ushiromiya Ange\'s voice to him...
That is who ANGE BEATRICE is—who I am...!!
I will use the piece I am as a sacrifice...
to give Onii‐chan the will to fight, to give him purpose!
Onii‐chan, my purpose is not to play with you in a witch\'s game for all eternity!
I came to bring you Ushiromiya Ange\'s mourning and sadness!
 That is my unshakable purpose!
"......Ange!!
 Ange!!
 Aaaaaaaaaarrrghhh!!!"
The white, skinny arm holding Battler......was pale and transparent, almost like wax.
...But it was stained, so cruelly, with fresh blood......
"...I\'m.........
...going to disappear now, but......
......you fight with all you\'ve got,
 .........and make sure you...
...come back to me, okay........."
"............I\'ll be waiting,
 ............always...............
 ......I planned on helping you out a whole lot more than this,
 ......but I couldn\'t do anything.
 ......Sorry....................."
"D‐don\'t worry about that......!!
 You......taught me, didn\'t you......?!
 You taught me why I have to win...!
 And that...I absolutely have to win, and come back to you......!!"
"What have I.........been doing, lazing about playing in a place like this......?!!
 Yeah, I\'m not playing around here anymore...!!
 I\'m gonna come back, you better believe I\'ll come back!!
 I\'m definitely gonna come back, bringing a souvenir, I promise......!!!"
".........I don\'t need one,
 .........so just promise me one thing......"
"What is it? I\'ll promise anything...!!"
"......In a second, I\'m going to take my hand away......
 It must have hurt, right......?
 I held you so tightly...
 .........Sorry........."
".........I\'m alright,
 ......you don\'t have to turn around, so...
.........before I go...
...show me you at your...
...coolest.........
 ......Rise from your seat,
 ......point at the witch before your eyes,
 ......and declare that the game will recommence........."
Ange\'s hand......slid...
......and disappeared behind me.
The stark marks of her fingers were left behind in the blood that had been oozing from her fingernails...
But I turned around right away.
To take care of Ange\'s wounds...!
"Angeeeeeeeee...
eeee...ee.........
........................
 ......Ange...?"
"Aa~ah, and you even promised that you wouldn\'t turn around..."
"......A‐......Ange.........
ah, aahhh, ...wh‐where\'d she......"
Behind my chair,
 .........as though......about ten watermelons packed with blood...
...had all been smashed,
 ......there was a sticky, pulpy...
...mountain...
And around that mountain of blood and minced meat,
 ......the clothes and shoes Ange had been wearing...
...lay crumpled as though they had been thrown off...
......As though a human\'s insides alone had been pulverized and discarded.
......As though Ange, who had been standing there until just a second ago, had been crushed.........
"Ange......?
 Wh‐......where is Ange......?
 Where did Ange disappear to......?
 H‐hey!
 Where did Ange disappear to?!"
The two young‐looking witches said nothing,
 .........and just silently looked at the mountain of blood and meat and clothes.
But, ......I didn\'t want to accept it.
......I did not want to accept it!!!
"..................I was right in front of you.
 .........Watching the whole time.
 Watching what happened.........to Ange behind you."
"......D‐......do you know......?
 .........Where did...Ange go.........?"
".........While she still lived,
 pinch by pinch, massive red‐hot pincers...
...tore chunks of flesh the size of a thumb off of her,
 ......and threw them away."
".........I was watching.
 I watched as countless cruel tools, red‐hot from the witch\'s furnace, approached Ange from behind,
 and one bit at a time, ......pecked at her flesh, twisted it off, ripped it off in chunks, ......and tore her to pieces."
"............Ange should be proud.
 In order to exchange her last words with her brother,
 ......she withstood the gasps of pain until the very end...
 ......She should be proud of that."
......Like hell that happened......
But......rolling there,
 ......on top of that mountain of flesh and clothes,
 ............was, without a doubt, what she had been wearing on her head: those pink‐bead...hair ornaments.
To be honest, I was thinking they were a bit too childish and didn\'t really suit her...
......So I remembered them well.
...............Why has Ange been wearing these cheap hair ornaments all this time......?
No, no,
 ......this can\'t be Ange,
 ......it couldn\'t be,
 ......uug...uuuuhhhuuuuuuu...!
".....................That was honest, Beato."
"Battler didn\'t see it,
 so you could\'ve just said that she turned into butterflies and flew away, or something."
"......Y‐
...you guys also...
.........s‐......saw...
.........that happen......?"
"Y‐
......you watched Ange...
...get torn into...
...little bits...?"
"You were watching,
 .........and yet...
...you kept your faces...
...that calm.........?!"
Without answering, BERNKASTEL, LAMBDADELTA,
 and BEATRICE looked at me,
 ......some in pity, ...others in derision.........
She was calling herself Gretel,
 so after what happened with VIRGILIA in the last game, ......I was thinking up until now that she might be Beato\'s underling,
 and I was making sure not to trust her even though she was on my side...
And then,
 .........just as I learn that it was actually Ange,
 ......I\'m not permitted to see her face...
.........and when I turn around,
 ......I find...
......something...
......like this...
 ............uuuuuuoohhhhh.........!
"What does it matter?
 .........About your little sister."
"......What......did you say............?"
"You will never return from this place in any case.
 .........Whatever happens to your little sister in a world where you don\'t come home has nothing to do with you."
"As long as you play here, the Anges of countless worlds will live in isolation,
 and the same pain of her final moments just now will be forced upon them, diluted over a period of more than a decade."
".........However, that is of no importance, correct?
 It cannot be ‘seen’ by you from here.
 You cannot observe it.
 An unobservable truth cannot be proven except by the red truth."
"Therefore, your anxiety over Ange\'s future unhappiness might well be an ungrounded fear.
 ............She might, surprisingly enough, have an easy life ahead of her, never needing to work, thanks to Rudolf\'s inheritance, right?
 *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*...!"
......That was...
...a lie.
From Ange\'s arm, every part of the sad world that follows had poured into me in an instant.
It\'s all because...
......I keep on...
......lazing about forever...
......and playing in a place like this.........!!
......I...
never thought about anyone but myself......
I have to defeat her!
 I have to take back my family,
 ......and come back to Ange who\'s waiting for me, ......as soon as humanly possible.........!
Because even as I hang around with the witch like this,
 Ange\'s heart continues to be torn to bits by sadness...!!
"............Ange, ......is this...
......what you wanted to see......?"
......Towards the cruel witch who had indifferently spoken of Ange\'s brutal last moments, slowly,
 ......and yet...
...with all my might,
 ......I pointed......
".........BEATRICE......"
"Mm."
"............Resume this game.
 .........I won\'t run away anymore, ......and I won\'t let you get away, either."
"As I like it.
 I can no longer escape or hide.
 .........Let us settle this between us for certain.
 .........One will win.
 One will lose, and be destroyed.
 No other resolution exists."
".........I will win.
 No matter how long it takes, I will definitely defeat you...!!
 In this match, there will no longer be any compromise, interruptions or losing by default!!
 I won\'t run away!
 You won\'t get away!!"
"Come take me down, with everything you\'ve got...!!
 There\'s no need for any stupid tricks or deceptions, no need for interacting with each other weirdly or acting all friendly!!
 You and I are enemies...!!!
 I have to settle this as soon as possible, .........and bring my family back to Ange!!!"
......Unwavering purpose.
 ...Absolute, certain willpower.
A Human\'s certain willpower becomes certain magical power.
......That acts as a miracle, and makes it a promise.
Yes, this is a promised certain miracle.
..................Is there not even a one in ten‐billion chance...
no.........is it certain that there is not even a fragment of a miracle...
that could make my victory happen?
Before I knew it, a cold, stiff chain had bound my other leg without a sound,
 fastening me to the chair...
............All that is left to me is either to be killed by Battler and be defeated,
 or resist that, and repeatedly tie for all eternity.
......No, I guess that\'s "repeatedly tie until I prepare my heart for death".
Either way.
.........I must now fight only to lose.
I have already been bound in eternal chains.
And Battler won\'t let me escape either.
......Should I pathetically beg for his forgiveness...?
Should I ask for compassion by appealing to his pitying heart...?
Should I disregard appearances and prostrate myself?
Because of the chains, even that will not be granted me.
......Checkmate.
The perfect endgame.
.................................However.
I am the Golden Witch, BEATRICE.
The demon lord of gold who reigns over the Golden Land.
It may be a losing battle, but still there exists an attitude befitting my stature.
And I have the right to beautify my death in a manner fitting for me.
".........And I likewise.
 I will make you accept the existence of my magic, and open the door to the Golden Land on this island.
 You shall become the guest of honor at the very first tea party."
"Everyone besides you has gathered already, you see?
 Because the arrival of the guest of honor has been delayed, the tea party cannot begin.
 Your father, mother, cousins, and everyone else are getting tired of waiting for your arrival."
"Yeah, suits me, suits me absolutely perfect!!
 Magic and witches, what a load of bullshit...!!
 I\'m done playing games with you!!
 Here we go, BEATRICE...!!!"
"I suggest you hold nothing back, for there will be no compromise, interruptions or losing by default.
 One will win, and one will be destroyed."
"If you have no desire to lose, then you must defeat me, kill me.
 However, I will not go down without a fight.
 I can resist repeatedly, until you prepare a fitting end for me."
"Are you capable of doing that?
 ......Yes, I\'m sure you can.
 I know you can.
 Now...come kill me.
 ..................
 .....................Am I making you uncomfortable?
 Then let\'s go with something more familiar.
 ....................."
"Hyahhaha!!
 Like hell I\'ll be killed,
 even if I can\'t win, I can still frustrate the hell out of you by not giving you the victory, riiiiiiiiight?!"
"Hoh, that\'s a good look on your face!
 ......*cackle*cackle*cackle*,
 uhhyahhahahahahahahahaha,
 aaakkyakkyakkyakkyakkya!!"
"Try and kill me,
 just try and kill me, Ushiromiya Battleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeer!! Rrrrrooooooooooooooooohhhhaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh!!!"
