"Battler‐san returned to the guesthouse at {nobr:3 a.m.}
 Then, the rest of you split up about thirty minutes later, is that correct?"
"Yes, that\'s right.
 We were getting pretty tired by that point.
 We decided to take a short rest before starting up again."
To smoke out the murderer of the first twilight,
 Erika closely questioned everyone involved to check their alibis and evidence.
To confirm these, she went around the mansion with them,
 and when needed, took several trips out to the guesthouse through all the rain.
......Her vitality was admirable.
......Though she was an uninvited guest,
 everyone had long since stopped feeling anything strange about the way she imitated a detective...
"......It seems Erika is also steadily building her foundation."
"It\'s useless.
 Whether alibis exist or not, she can\'t deny our existence.
 ......Kinzo escaped through the window and is now one with the mists of Rokkenjima.
 She can never capture or deny him."
"When all\'s said and done, perhaps you could say he\'s escaped to the underside of the chessboard."
"In that case, maybe it would be appropriate to say he\'s been stored away."
"......Come to think of it, about those corpses from the first twilight.
 They\'ve been stored away too, right?"
"Yes.
 They\'ve been put away in my darkness between the human world and the other."
"......And that would‐be detective won\'t be able to find them...?"
"Of course.
 It\'s absolutely impossible for a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}.
 .........Want to check?"
"Just in case.
 And we also need to take this opportunity to reexamine what Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}\'s goals are likely to be from now on."
"As they say, if you know your enemy, you need not fear the outcome of a hundred battles."
"If you know the truth, you can win a hundred battles without fighting."
"Pukkukukukuku.
 Quite so."
Gaap opened up a large pitch‐black hole in the sky and had it swallow all of them up.
She invited Beato and Ronove to the gap between worlds where she had hidden the corpses......
......That place was nowhere in this world,
 and existed at no time of this world.
In other words, it truly and literally was a place not of this world.
In this place, questions such as "Where is this?" and "What time is it?" had no meaning.
Every single place led to here, but no place could be reached from here.
Furthermore, all times connected to this place, but no time could be passed to from here.
In short, ......this place was just what they said it was: the underside of the chessboard.
No, perhaps it would be most appropriate to call this the captured pile, where pieces that have left the game go......
......Then, deep within this pitch‐black world,
 five corpses came into view, illuminated by a glow like a faint spotlight......
The five pitiful corpses with their necks sliced open had been arranged neatly.
Their eyelids were shut and their hands joined.
{n}Apparently, even Gaap had respect for the dead...
"Oh my.
 .........There are five sacrifices for the first twilight in this game?
 Not six?"
"Oh, it\'s you, Master.
 I was worried about where you\'d gone.
 The game has already reached the first twilight, and as you can see, the first victims have emerged.
 ......Now it\'s time for the real show. I\'m getting all excited...!"
"I see.
 .........The version of you that\'s here looks to be in high spirits.
 I\'m pleased."
"Hm??
 If you took away my high spirits, my bewitching <body>,
 and my pleasant disposition, I\'d have nothing left!
 Wahaha."
For some reason, {f:5:Virgilia} praised Beato for her high spirits.
Though Beato was taken aback at such granny‐like words coming out of {f:5:Virgilia}\'s mouth all of a sudden,
 she answered while bumping a fist against her chest.
{f:5:Virgilia} had been absent often during this game.
She might even have been away from her seat when Battler solved the epitaph and during the uproar that followed.
Apparently, she had been absent for so many critical points...
that she didn\'t have a very good grasp of what had happened so far in this game...
"For now, we\'ve got five corpses.
 ......All slit through the neck, as you can see."
George, Jessica, Maria, Rosa, Genji.
Something sharp had sliced open all five of their necks......
Those gaping wounds opened wider than their mouths,
 ......and made it feel as though they would no longer need their mouths to breathe.
"......I see.
 So, 
anyone looking at George, Jessica, Maria, Rosa, or Genji\'s corpses could confirm at a glance that they are dead}."
"Hmm?
 Red?
 Well, there\'s no point in me holding out against you.
 That\'s right,
 
at a glance, anyone could confirm that these corpses are dead, so it is absolutely impossible that they are just people playing dead}."
"Why did Lia use the red......?"
"Who knows.
 ......However, she is always thinking of Milady.
 She must have something in mind that will benefit Milady."
"......Hmmm."
But they had hidden the corpses here so that no one could use the red...
Despite that, however, Ronove was right—{f:5:Virgilia} always thought of {f:5:Beatrice} first.
The way that these corpses, which Gaap had gone to all the trouble of erasing, had now been confirmed with the red made a slightly displeased expression rise to Gaap\'s face.
However, in the end she remembered that she was only a guest and shrugged.
"Why did you have Gaap hide the corpses?"
"Well,
 since the epitaph has already been solved, this game of mine is different from usual.
 I now have serving and protecting Natsuhi as my goal."
"...........................
 How would concealing their corpses protect Natsuhi?"
"......We\'ve more or less figured out what our opponents\' moves will be.
 This is probably a trap made to corner Natsuhi.
 Most likely, they\'ll sort through alibis for the first twilight and find them for everyone except Natsuhi."
"Last night, Natsuhi‐sama was the first to leave the family conference, and then rested alone in her room.
 ......Unfortunately, she has no alibi whatsoever until the next morning."
"We have already ensured that Kinzo\'s existence is impossible to disprove.
 ......However, the enemy has one remaining method of breaking through that roadblock."
"I see.
 .........They can corner Natsuhi and make her confess that Kinzo doesn\'t exist."
"Mm.
 The enemy is probably after something like that.
 By watching the movements of the pieces involved with the family conference, we quickly realized that Natsuhi was isolated,
 noticed that trap of theirs, and countered with this move."
"The corpses disappear!
 Everyone has alibis, and no one exists who could have moved them.
 Not only does this support the claim that a witch exists, it also throws doubt on whether they were actually dead in the first place,
 making it just about possible for Natsuhi to avoid being a suspect."
"In other words, it\'s possible for Natsuhi‐sama to claim...
that the sacrifices of the first twilight were only playing dead."
"Even though many people confirmed their deaths for certain in the cousins\' room...?"
"‘Confirmation’ is nowhere near red truth...!
 No matter how strongly they claim to have seen unmistakeable corpses, the red truth doesn\'t exist in the human world!
 Because the corpses don\'t exist, Natsuhi can discount their words as a mistake,
 a trick, or by saying that all of them were lying,
 and it\'s possible for her to do this over and over to buy time for herself."
"In the human world, which lacks the red truth, perpetual check is an effective move."
"An endless argument with both sides denying the other\'s claims.
 ......Not pretty."
"True.
 However, beauty is secondary to victory.
 If someone who cannot achieve victory seeks it, it is nothing but a poison to them."
"They do say that might makes right.
 Wahahahahaha."
"And even if I don\'t think it\'s beautiful,
 those Voyager witches will probably like it and say it isn\'t boring..."
"............I see.
 I\'ve managed to grasp the flow of this game.
 ...It seems that it will get quite nasty."
"We\'re fully aware of that.
 ......And we already know that Natsuhi is probably about to be lured into yet another trap."
"A trap?"
"Mm.
 Someone Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta} created, who calls himself a man from 19 years ago, has already threatened Natsuhi.
 She was ordered to go into a closet in a certain guest room at {nobr:1 p.m.}, which is only a few minutes away, and hide there.
 ......Krauss was taken as a hostage, so Natsuhi can\'t resist."
".........I see.
 How relentless.
 ...Can you protect her?"
"Of course.
 After all, Natsuhi isn\'t the culprit.
 No matter how much they treat her as one, both truth and illusions are on our side.
 There\'s no way we can lose.
 *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!"
Natsuhi threw her cup of black tea to the ground in protest to show the anger that flowed throughout her entire body.
"......Wh‐what do you mean by that...?!!
 A‐are you......saying that you suspect me?!!"
"I hear what you\'re saying: you left before anyone else, returned to your room, and didn\'t leave that room until morning.
 I am simply explaining that I need you to prove that, otherwise it won\'t count as an alibi."
"Prove it...?!
 How...?!!"
"Any way you like.
 All you have to do is prove objectively that it was impossible for you to commit the crime.
 .........Everyone else is cooperating.
 I would very much appreciate it if you could also be a little less harsh with me and please give me your alibi and evidence."
"......That\'s right.
 The whole night is a blank space in time for Natsuhi nee‐san.
 ......After she left the conference saying she was going to bed, she might have gone to the guesthouse and attacked George and the others..."
"Don\'t be so ridiculous!!
 Why would I kill George‐kun, and most of all, whyever would I kill my own daughter?!!"
"Calm down.
 ......We\'re all equally suspicious.
 It\'s sad, but we all have to prove our innocence."
"Yeah.
 We\'ve all been thinking frantically about how to prove our alibis for last night so we can clear up the suspicion against us."
"I know you can\'t like being suspected, Natsuhi‐san.
 If it frustrates you, shouldn\'t your first priority be searchin\' for some way to prove your own innocence...?"
The relatives spoke as though they were all under equal suspicion,
 but the mood about the place didn\'t feel so peaceful.
Erika was still in the middle of confirming everything,
 but other than Natsuhi, who was unwilling to prove her alibi,
 everyone else had an alibi which was reasonably credible.
Only Natsuhi, who claimed that just being suspected was an insult, was uncooperative with Erika,
 and her position began to grow more and more perilous......
This parlor was no longer a place of comfort for Natsuhi.
{n}And the sound of the cup smashing had made that decisive.
"Th‐......this is ridiculous!
 Why must I be suspected when I\'ve lost a daughter...?!!
 You\'re maliciously trying to make me look like the culprit just because I went to bed early last night!
 I cannot stand this humiliation any further...!!"
"Oh, so what are you going to do about it?
 Show us some kind of alibi that proves your innocence.
 As if you could!!
 Give me back my George, you murderer!!"
"Give it a rest, Eva...!
 ......Natsuhi‐san, you\'re probably a little tired too.
 Of course, so are we.
 Why don\'t we take it easy for a bit...?"
".........Seriously.
 We\'re a little too high‐strung."
"Aunt Natsuhi......
 Where are you going...?"
"This search for alibis and culprits is truly ludicrous...!
 When the typhoon passes and the police arrive, everything will be exposed to the light of day.
 There\'s no reason whatsoever for us to play detectives.
 Am I wrong, Erika‐san?"
"Generally speaking, you would be right.
 However, I have the authority to do this."
Who gave her that authority?
 No one asked.
It was an authority given by words of power from a higher world,
 so the pieces weren\'t even allowed to doubt it...
"I will take my leave.
 I have no intention of playing along with your pointless questioning until the police are here.
 If you suspect me, feel free to do so.
 I will leave it to the police to investigate that and clear my name."
.........It may be a bit late to mention this, but—well, no, this happens every time.
As usual, the phone couldn\'t connect to the police.
Natsuhi said the police would come, but that wasn\'t exactly true.
Strictly speaking, the boat to pick them up would come tomorrow, and they would be able to use the radio on that boat to contact the police.
Well, ......it\'s not like I\'ll let everyone live that long anyway.
...*giggle*.
"......Natsuhi‐san, it\'s dangerous to be alone...
 Perhaps it would be better if you......"
"Why not let her?
 That might make for some excellent proof.
 If Natsuhi nee‐san gets murdered in her own room, that\'ll be excellent proof of her innocence."
"Quit it, Aneki.
 .........It\'s probably best if we all get a bit of rest.
 Our bodies won\'t last until tomorrow."
"Rest is fine, but let\'s not let our guard down, okay...?
 We might not make it through the night, much less tomorrow."
"............Aunt Natsuhi.
 If you\'re returning to your room, make sure you lock it tight, close the windows and shutters, and stay safe.
 ......I don\'t want to suspect anyone.
 And more than that, ......I don\'t want there to be any more victims."
".........Thank you, Battler‐kun.
 .........Then I\'ll return to my room.
 Gohda, you\'re in charge now.
 I know this is a horrible situation, but make sure that the guests at least have everything they need."
"Y‐yes, Madam......
 I shall do so......"
With everyone watching her, Natsuhi left the parlor.
From their faces, she could tell that they were expecting the classic mystery pattern...
that the first person to quarrel and leave the circle would become the next victim.
............Natsuhi......couldn\'t disobey because of the threat against Krauss, who had been taken as a hostage.
Very soon, it would be {nobr:1 p.m.}, the time that had been arranged.
She was to hide for an hour in the closet of a specific guest room.
It was easy to suspect that this bizarre order was a trap to select her as the next sacrifice.
She thought of various ways to resist,
 but all methods would be useless against a culprit who had a hostage and was observing her from close by...
So Natsuhi could do nothing but obediently follow his orders,
 and then claim that she had been forced to do this for her husband\'s safety...
As the arranged time had drawn near,
 Natsuhi had intentionally acted annoyed and smashed the cup on the ground to give her an excuse for slipping out of the parlor.
.........At any rate, no matter how cowardly a trap it may be, ......I cannot disobey now.
I am now the one who carries the burden of the One‐winged Eagle.
......Now that my husband, Krauss, has been captured,
 I must protect it even if I have to crawl through the mud...
".............................."
......Of course, I am prepared to do that.
 I am Ushiromiya Natsuhi.
Even if I am not permitted to bear the One‐winged Eagle on my clothes,
 .........Father gave me permission to bear it in my heart......
".............................."
......I think dashing away in a rage got me here without raising too much suspicion.
So far......everything has gone well.
Before my eyes was the doorknob of the specified guest room.
{n}......However, ...I wondered about the lock.
The servants are under orders to always lock any unused rooms.
......What will I do if it\'s locked...?
I dashed out of the parlor pretending that I was returning to my room.
Going back and asking a servant to unlock this guest room would be obviously suspicious...
If possible, ......I\'d like to get this eerie hide‐and‐seek over with without anyone noticing.
In that phone call from the one who claimed to be a man from 19 years ago,
 he said that I would win if no one found me, but lose if anyone did find me.
He said that he\'d release my husband whether I won or lost,
 ......but as a person with a hostage taken against me, I\'d rather not lose...
I don\'t like it at all, but I have to go along with this game.
I softly gripped the doorknob, ......and I could feel that it was unlocked.
Did Shannon or Kumasawa forget to lock it after cleaning?
......Or did that man unlock it in advance......?
That man...
...couldn\'t be waiting for me in this room, could he?
And then...
...he\'ll...
........................
All that about hide‐and‐seek might have been just an excuse.
I kept the fact that I was coming here secret, and all of the other people think I\'m resting in my room.
If I were to be killed in this situation, in this room,
 ......it might create a new baffling murder case, like an extension of the one which occurred this morning.
".........I‐...if that\'s what he\'s up to, so much the better.
 ...It will be a good chance to confront the culprit directly..."
Natsuhi had some experience with using a {ruby:Japanese polearm:naginata}, but only from casual lessons.
Unlike Eva, she couldn\'t brag about being able to hold off any single ruffian indefinitely.
As she was now, she had no realistic chance of prevailing over a man with malicious intent on her own, and no weapons that could make that possible.
".............................."
She readied herself......and slowly opened the door.
She couldn\'t afford to stand around in the corridor and risk being seen by someone...
The atmosphere inside the guest room......was ice‐cold,
 and she could sense no trace of a person waiting impatiently for her.
All she could hear were the unsettling sounds of the wind and rain.
At first, that seemed to be proof that no one existed to threaten her,
 ......but before long, it only stirred up the uneasy feeling inside her all the more...
The closet was just off to the side of anyone entering the room.
Lined up inside it was a set of hangers where guests could hang their coats.
This closet, which had nothing hanging in it, was large enough for even an adult to hide in...
She softly opened the closet.
 ......Of course, there was nothing inside.
She would have to hide quietly in here for an hour.
The room had a wood floor, but something like a carpet had been laid in the closet.
......It seemed that sitting down wouldn\'t be a problem.
She had been sure that someone would be waiting for her in this room,
 or that a strange letter would be lying in the closet.
......She had even imagined the worst, that her husband\'s corpse might be inside.
However, none of these things she imagined turned out to be true.
All that was here was a cold guest room...
and a lifeless closet which silently urged her to go inside......
"............And he told me...to hide in here for an hour...
 ......He\'s making fun of me."
Natsuhi shrugged, turned around, then locked and chained the guest room door.
"This way, no one will be able to get into this room.
 ......In other words, no one will be able to find me for the next hour.
 I win.
 What a stupid game of hide‐and‐seek."
This would certainly result in a total victory in the hide‐and‐seek game against that mystery man.
......However, it was such an easy victory, it made her feel uneasy.
This is normally against the rules of hide‐and‐seek...
......Even if I win, won\'t this displease the culprit?
And everyone thinks I\'m in my room right now.
If they find a room with a chain set, that will be an impossible locked room to them.
Erika was dashing around the mansion to confirm everyone\'s alibi.
If she notices that the chain is set on this room, there will probably be an uproar which will end in them cutting the chain and searching the room.
......If that happens, I\'ll be found hiding in the closet right away.
It would be easy for me to honestly confess why I was hiding.
But that man insisted that I not reveal that.
......If I tell them, ......I might be endangering my husband...
Thinking of it that way, setting the chain.........no, even locking the door might be a bad idea.
That\'s right.
 This room was unlocked when I came here.
If it were to suddenly become locked, it\'s conceivable that it might catch someone\'s attention.
......It\'s better if I don\'t do anything unnecessary...
{n}That man only told me to hide......
"............So in the end, ...I have no choice...but to do what he says......"
I hate doing it, ......but I can\'t disobey.
I undid both of those two precious locks,
 ......went into the dimly lit closet filled with the smell of old wood, and managed to close the door from the inside.
......Pitch black.
It reminded me of when I was young, when I used to hide somewhere and then surprise my mother,
 but that peaceful recollection wasn\'t enough to kill off my anxiety.
It really is pitch black.
From in here, I won\'t even be able to check my watch to see if an hour has passed.
I\'ll probably need to open the door a crack every once in a while to let in enough light for my watch.
......For now, .........I sat down and folded my legs.
I thought about holding my knees to my chest, but it hurt my back when I tried.
I\'m not as young as I used to be.
Even though I and the rest of my class were made to sit on the floor clasping our knees in every PE class as grade schoolers,
 I now have to struggle just to sit down.
Just sitting down here for an hour...
will probably hurt a lot......
"........................haah............"
I can\'t believe.........he expects me to sit in the darkness for a full hour, listening only to the wind and the rain.
Ironically, Natsuhi had made Jessica do the exact same thing in the past.
She had done it to scold Jessica\'s persistent bad habits and teach her a lesson when she was a little girl.
She had thought that making Jessica stay put in the darkness would sprout a desire to reflect on her mistakes,
 and that, this way, she would understand what she had done wrong.
......To Natsuhi, it almost felt like......she was being made to do the same thing.
If that was the true purpose of this hide‐and‐seek......
.......................................
"......How naive of me."
This must be my naivety, the hope that if his goal is to make me repent,
 nothing will happen here during this hour...
Uncertainty and fear of that man\'s shadow are not what I need right now.
Will someone suddenly come to this room, open this closet,
 ......and do something horrible to me now that I\'ve come here in total secrecy as promised?
......That\'s what I should be worrying about.
The culprit, ......or one of his accomplices, is very close by.
{n}If they weren\'t, they wouldn\'t be able to observe me so thoroughly.
I don\'t want to think it, but it\'s highly likely that the culprit bought off one of the servants.
The culprit was able to hide an eerie card with "autumn" written on it in my room.
My personal room is always locked.
{n}That trick wouldn\'t have been possible without a key.
Instead of believing that they obtained the key when the servants weren\'t looking,
 it\'s much more realistic to assume that one of the servants lent the culprit a hand...
"Still,
 .........h‐how...
......did they know that autumn is my favorite season.........?
 .........How ghastly........."
The thought that this mystery man might be peeking into my heart sent goosebumps running across my whole body...
It\'s true that I like autumn, but I\'ve never said that out loud.
{n}I don\'t think anyone\'s ever asked me, either.
......I could even ask my husband what my favorite season is and he would probably be stuck for an answer.
............N‐no.
{n}There was one time, one time I told it to a single person.........
That\'s right.
 ...............Shannon...
On an autumn day long ago, I happened to be in a good mood,
 and I mentioned that autumn was my favorite of the four seasons.
......I can\'t believe it... Then the culprit, or one of their accomplices, has to be Shannon...!
"Only Shannon could know that I like autumn...
 ......In that case, ......this is clear proof that Shannon is involved...!
 That card with "autumn" on it is proof...!
 ......Incredible...
 After ten years of being provided for by our family........."
I trembled and shook with rage.
......Didn\'t Kinzo once say that the emotion of anger...
is the fastest sedative to cure fear and uncertainty?
It\'s easy to tell the most fearful humans from within a crowd.
They\'re always the first to get angry.
......I remember him telling me that.
So I realized that this anger was a sign that I was actually frightened,
 and I tried my best to remain calm...
......However, this is a fascinating clue that I can use to turn things around.
Shannon may not be reliable as a servant,
 but if she\'s the accomplice used by that mystery man, this might actually be convenient.
She\'s a timid girl.
 If I threaten her, she\'ll probably spill the name of the mastermind in an instant.
I\'ll tell the police about this in secret.
{n}I\'m certain it will be a big clue that will help in arresting the culprit.
"......That card was probably meant to surprise me and control me,
 ......but he\'s actually dug his own grave."
{a:c:

I never told anyone except Shannon that I like autumn}.}
This is unshakable proof that she\'s working with the culprit......
Though I\'d thought this time in the closet would crush me with uncertainty and uneasiness, it had actually given me the start of a counterattack.
If I hadn\'t been given this time in the darkness, I probably wouldn\'t have noticed this.
I felt almost grateful to the culprit for making up this foolish game.
......My mood brightened.
...I still couldn\'t guarantee that my husband was safe, but I was determined to take him back and force the culprit to face judgment...
I gripped my fists tightly, and further strengthened my resolve to avoid losing this fight at any cost...
Rattle, rattle!!
At that moment, I heard the sudden sound of someone trying to force a locked door open,
 and my heart leapt.
"......Oh, it was unlocked."
The voice was Hideyoshi\'s.
{n}I heard a quiet voice, as though he was talking to himself, coming from what was probably the hallway.
Apparently, he had thought it was locked and tried to unlock it,
 but had ended up locking the unlocked door instead.
Once again, there was the sound of the lock turning, and this time, the door opened with a faint sound......
......Why...
...is Hideyoshi‐san in this room......?!
Footsteps which sounded like his came in, and there was the sound of him closing and locking the door behind him.
Then came what seemed to be the sound of him setting the chain.
.........Don\'t tell me...
...Hideyoshi‐san...
...is the mastermind...?!
{n}Or else, an accomplice...?!
Is he planning to do something to me in this room...?
The door may only be locked from the inside, but it will still take some time to remove the chain.
......If Hideyoshi‐san doesn\'t intend to let me escape from here,
 there\'s no chance he\'ll give me time to fumble around with the chain...
In that case.........
......when he opens the closet door wide in just a moment...
...and looks down upon me sitting here pathetically,
 ......just what kind of horrifying words will he say...?
I don\'t want to be found, I don\'t want to be found...
{n}I beg you, pass right on by the closet door...
{n}Please keep going into the center of the room......!
My head was filled almost to bursting with a throbbing sound so loud that I almost missed hearing his noisy footsteps.
So when I heard a clunking sound coming from the center of the room,
 I finally realized that he\'d passed by the closet, and was deeply relieved.
"......Just in case.
 Can\'t tell if it\'s day or night in this weather anyway."
As he muttered, he did something that made a clunking sound.
{n}......He was probably closing the shutters on the windows.
Just in case?
{n}In case I try to escape out the window...?
No, ......that can\'t be it.
That\'s right.
When I left the parlor, everyone was talking about possibly taking a break.
After all, several murders had occurred.
 And the weather was bad.
{n}......There would be nothing abnormal about resting in a guest room here instead of returning to the guesthouse.
In that case, locking up and closing the shutters to guarantee safety was the proper course of action to take.
When he finished closing the shutters,
 ......there was a thunk
 as though he had flopped over on the bed.
......It was surprising how much of the situation could be grasped just by the sound.
.........What\'s going on here......?
Did the man from 19 years ago......plan all this out to put me in the same room as Hideyoshi‐san...?
No, ......that probably...isn\'t true.
Clearly he planned on me hiding here,
 ......but Hideyoshi‐san coming to take a rest here must have been outside the scope of his plan.
Thinking about it that way, .........having him in the room...
might help to secure my own safety in an odd sort of way.
......Unlike his wife, Hideyoshi‐san is the kind of person I can talk to.
{n}If Eva‐san comes, things will probably get complicated.
Maybe I should slip out of this closet now while he\'s still alone,
 reveal everything just to him, and ask for help......
But if I do that, my husband might be killed...
It isn\'t wise to do anything rash until my husband is released......
Should I go out and talk, or hide in here?
Moaning from my headache and biting my lower lip, I resisted the temptation to crawl out of here...
Even if I talk with Hideyoshi‐san, I don\'t know where my husband is being held.
 I\'m sure the informant who\'s observing me is nearby as well.
Just talking to him won\'t solve everything.
......I suspect that Shannon is an informant, but that doesn\'t mean that Gohda and the others aren\'t.
......It\'s no good......
 Leaving here and confessing is just too dangerous...
Eventually, ......I heard a strange, sobbing voice.
......Whose voice was it......?
I strained my ears, trying to hear that strange voice,
 .........and was shocked to discover that it was Hideyoshi weeping...
Now that he was all alone like this, Hideyoshi, ......who had lost his only son,
 was finally able to shed tears and cry...
......Thinking that he needed to support Eva in her distress, he had acted as though he alone was standing firm.
However, he had as good a right as anyone to cry.
......And now that he had found a place where no one could see his tears,
 he was finally allowing himself to let it out...
............I\'ve...
...lost my daughter too.
...I haven\'t seen her body with my own eyes, ......so it still doesn\'t really feel like she\'s dead.
But if the one who carried her off was the culprit...
and he had some repulsive motive for doing it, ......just thinking about it makes me feel as though my chest will tear itself apart...
The reason I\'m hiding in here now is that I\'m thinking more about my still living husband than my dead daughter.
......But if I were given the chance, ...I\'d be wailing at the top of my lungs too.
However, ......I still can\'t let myself do that.
......That isn\'t because the man from 19 years ago told me to hide.
It\'s because............I am the final...head of the Ushiromiya family......
It\'s been completely overshadowed by all of this,
 ......but last night, Battler‐kun found the hidden gold and even gained the Head\'s Ring from that mysterious envelope.
.........At the very, very end, when it\'s all over...
{n}I probably won\'t be able to prevent him from inheriting the family headship.
And when everything regarding the distribution of the inheritance is revealed,
 ......the Ushiromiya family honor and glory passed down from Father.........will plummet to the earth.
So, ......I am the final head.
Battler‐kun will probably inherit the remaining wealth of the Ushiromiya family.
However, its history and honor......will all end with my generation......
Therefore, ......I am the final head.
{n}I must not cry.
 .........Not yet.
Until I get my husband back......and avenge my daughter, I will not be allowed to shed tears......
As I listened to Hideyoshi‐san\'s sobs from the closet,
 I silently hung my head......
"Wh‐who are you...?!"
Huh?!
My heart leapt.
Hideyoshi‐san, who must have been lying prostrate on the bed, made a sound as though he had bounded to his feet.
......D‐......did he notice me......?
"How did you get in here......?
 ......Wh‐...what\'s that...?
 ......W‐wait a second...!
 Wai.........ngahh, ......mmpph—"
He was clearly in a struggle with someone.
......Who could it be?!
 No, it doesn\'t matter who it is.
It\'s probably the culprit, and they\'re probably trying to take Hideyoshi‐san\'s life at this very moment...!
Shouldn\'t I jump out of here and help him...?
{n}Even if I couldn\'t help him, I could at least call for help......
...No, but...if I do something like that, I\'ll be questioned about why I was hiding here...!
However, if Hideyoshi‐san goes on to get killed now......
No, now isn\'t the time to be saying that...
{n}At this rate, he\'ll definitely be killed...!
I\'ll jump out of here and help him right now...!
Aaah, but if I do that, even if I can save Hideyoshi‐san, ......I might be abandoning my husband\'s life.
Hideyoshi‐san\'s life and my husband\'s life.
{n}......How sinful it would be to try to weigh those against each other...!!
Just then, there was a loud sound of the door opening and the chain being pulled tight.
Someone was trying to open the door despite the chain being set.
"Honey, it\'s me.
 Could you open up?"
"......Eva, ......aah, gwaaaaaaggghhhh...!!"
"Honey?
 ...What?! What\'s happening?!
 Honey?!
 Open up!!"
"Ggh......
............gggh
............ggh........."
"Open up!
 Open up, honey!!
 S‐someooooooooooone!!"
She opened and closed the door over and over again with all her might, but of course, she couldn\'t snap the chain.
Eva‐san raced down the hallway calling for help in a loud voice......
By this time, the room had settled back into silence,
 ......and that earlier feeling of Hideyoshi being in a noisy struggle had disappeared completely.
What\'s.........going on here......?!
So, right now, ......I\'m in the same room as the murderer who killed Hideyoshi‐san......?!
In that case, the culprit should try to escape from the room as soon as possible, ......so why are they staying so quiet in here...?!
I haven\'t heard anything,
 ......nothing that might have been the culprit who attacked Hideyoshi‐san rushing away.
......No matter how much I strain my ears, I can\'t sense anyone in the room.
In fact, ......it\'s so silent that it makes what happened just a second ago feel like an illusion.
In other words, .........does this mean......that the culprit is holding his breath,
 standing right in front of this closet...
waiting for me to shamelessly come out......?
I don\'t even know what to be scared of anymore.
If only I could just melt away into the darkness of this closet...!
I mustn\'t remain in this room any longer.
{n}I get the feeling I have more to worry about than just my personal safety...
But what should I do?!
I don\'t even know if it\'s a good idea to leave this closet...!!
Before long, the clamor of many rushing footsteps approached.
I held my breath again and melted away into the darkness of the closet......
Eva dashed back, bringing everyone with her.
Gohda was gripping a bolt cutter.
{n}It was to cut the chain with.
After trying to open the door again and confirming that the chain was still set, she yelled through the crack in the door.
"Honey!!
 We\'re going to open this up...!!
 Cut it right now!!"
"Y‐yes...!"
Gohda stuck the large bolt cutter, which looked like it could slice off whole fingers,
 into the crack in the door and easily severed the chain.
"Dear!!"
As soon as it was severed, Eva pushed Gohda aside and dashed in.
The others tried to follow her, .........but they bumped into Eva, who had fallen to her knees, moaning.
So even though they couldn\'t tell much of what was going on inside the room,
 ...they could tell by Eva\'s moans that they were too late......
"......What the hell......"
"Honey...!! Honey{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}yyy!!
 Doctor Nanjo!!
 Look at my husband...! Quickly!!"
"I, I\'ll do it right now......"
"You\'ve got to be kidding me......
 ...It\'s only been about ten minutes since Uncle Hideyoshi went out saying he wanted to rest......"
"......Is there anyone in the bathroom?"
"N‐no...!
 There\'s no one here!"
"What could have happened, ...aaaaaahhhh......"
"Honey!!
 Honey{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}yyy...!!"
".........I\'m afraid to say...that there\'s nothing I can do......"
Nanjo stood up, hanging his head sadly.
It was only natural.
Because anyone, even if they weren\'t a doctor, would think that at a glance.
......Hideyoshi......was lying face down on the bed.
And stuck deep into his back.........was something like a blade with an intricate demonic design on it.
When Eva pulled it out with all her might,
 they could tell that it wasn\'t a blade, but some kind of stake.
And its sharp tip had penetrated nearly fifteen centimeters in.
It had probably dug deep into the lungs.
......If it had been stuck in any harder, the tip might even have pierced all the way through to the surface of his chest......
"Didn\'t I tell you to wait for me?!!
 Why did you go on alone...?!!
 Stupid, stupid,
 stupiii{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}iiid!!
 Uwaaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aahhhh!!"
"......The culprit probably waited for us to get careless and split up......"
"That bastard......
 So he still hasn\'t had enough blood...?!"
"So he really is......hiding somewhere in this mansion...
...and coming after us......?"
"But there\'s something strange here.
 ......The doors and windows to this room are completely sealed."
"............ah.
 ...Th‐that\'s right.
 The shutters are all shut, and the chain was on the door until a second ago......"
"Huh?!
 Isn\'t that bizarre...?!
 In that case, how did the culprit attack Hideyoshi‐san in this room...?!"
"Perhaps they threw this stake through the crack in the door......!"
"Hideyoshi‐san\'s bed is in a total blind spot from this crack.
 You couldn\'t even kill him with a gun.
 .........This really is strange.
 It\'s a locked‐room murder."
"A, ......a locked‐room murder......"
"......It\'s a bit too early to be sure about that.
 Maybe the culprit removed the ceiling in the bathroom and escaped to the space above it, or maybe you can close the shutters from outside."
"The shutters.
 ............They didn\'t budge an inch from the outside.
 I just went and checked."
"......Erika........."
It was no wonder everything felt so quiet and relaxed.
{n}At some point, Erika had split from the group.
Just now, she had finally arrived and poked her face in from the hallway.
......She had heard that a crime had occurred in this room,
 seen everyone rushing towards it, and taken the opposite approach by circling around to the outer wall.
And she had gone all by herself to check that the shutters were down on the windows, that you couldn\'t do anything with them from the outside,
 ......and that there was nothing out of the ordinary.
"I assume that the inside of the room is perfectly cliché......?"
"......That was uncalled for."
"You have my deepest condolences.
 So? What is the state of the room?"
"..........................."
"......The chain was set on the door, so we cut it and entered."
"And all the windows have the shutters down.
 They\'re locked tight from the inside."
"......What are they bickering about in there?"
Eva was arguing with Nanjo about something.
Apparently, she wanted to carry the body to the parlor.
Nanjo tried to calm her, saying that they should leave the crime scene as untouched as possible until the police came.
"What happened to the other corpses when we did that?!
 The culprit carried them off somewhere!
 It may be that the culprit isn\'t satisfied with just killing, but intends to do something with the bodies as well...!!
 So no way!
 No way we\'re leaving my husband all alone here!!"
Eva did have a point.
After all, the prior victims were all carried away after we were shown their terrible and fatal wounds.
"......Erika‐chan.
 ...You\'d probably like to preserve the crime scene, but could you just let this one slide...?"
"........................
 ...Do as you wish.
 All I\'m interested in is the fact that a locked room has appeared that\'s much more serious than Kinzo‐san\'s study.
 I have no interest in corpses, so do as you please."
"....................."
Battler looked at her with an expression of clear disgust,
 ......but it rolled off her like water off a duck\'s back.
"......Well? You can take the corpse away now, I don\'t mind.
 Or am I in the way?"
Erika backed away from the door to open a path.
......There was no trace of any sadness for the dead.
{n}Her eyes simply blazed at the thought of this locked‐room murder that had appeared.
In any event, the great detective had given her permission.
......Eva and some others wrapped Hideyoshi\'s body up in the sheets, and Gohda and Rudolf started to carry him out...
The sheets quickly turned red.
It was so painful to see that Shannon and Kumasawa stripped the blanket off the bed to further cover the body...
"......Hey, out of the way."
"Yes, I am out of the way."
"Let\'s carry him to the parlor."
"Y‐yes...!"
"Honey, honeyyy{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y, awaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}ahhhhh...!!"
"......Listen up, everyone.
 From now on, we\'ll always move as a group.
 You must not let yourself be isolated."
"The culprit probably got a master key when he attacked Genji‐san.
 It\'s clear that locking up will no longer keep us safe."
"B‐but...even the chain was set. How did they do it......?!"
"......It\'s impossible...
 The shutters and the chain were firmly set.
 ......Even with a master key, it\'s impossible to force your way into that room......!"
"It must have been {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama\'s doing.........oooohhhhh......"
"......Th‐there\'s no way {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama did this...
 ......The epitaph has been solved, so there shouldn\'t be any more reason to hold the ritual..."
"As if we could understand her reasons...
 This is impossible for anyone except a witch...!"
"......Impossible for anyone except a witch...you say?
 <Good>!
 That has a nice ring to it."
"Erika‐chan, are you listening?
 We\'ve decided to stick together from now on.
 First, we\'re carrying Hideyoshi‐san\'s body to the parlor.
 Can you hold off playing detective until we get there?"
"........................"
When she heard the words "playing detective", Erika grimaced visibly.
Then, after everyone had filed out, she took a single step into the now empty guest room,
 .........looked around, and burned the scene into her eyes.
......Erika claimed to have a photographic memory.
If that was true, those few seconds were more than enough for her.
Later on, she could sip black tea in the parlor while perusing her mental photographs of the crime scene,
 and enjoy playing the part of the armchair detective...
Then, suddenly, her eyes stopped on the closet off to the side.
......A closet for hanging overcoats.
If it was large enough to fit a coat on a hanger,
 .........a person should be able to hide in it............
Slowly, ............Erika...
...stretched her hand out towards the closet............
".........ah—"
Erika\'s shoulder was grabbed roughly from behind.
"......Let\'s go, Ms. Detective.
 Didn\'t they teach you to stick with the group on school field trips?"
"Well, whenever I go traveling, someone always dies."
"Hey, what do you think you\'re doing, brats?!
 Move it...!!"
Rudolf told them to hurry.
After clicking her tongue and glaring at the closet, Erika followed Battler back to the parlor for the time being...
.........The sound of their footsteps finally faded.
That time of terror,
 when I feared that even the dripping of the cold sweat that covered my cheeks might be noticed, was finally......over.
I slowly opened the closet door with hands that still couldn\'t stop trembling and dashed out into the hallway.
It\'s alright, no one\'s found me......
{n}Still, it\'s a good thing they didn\'t lock the door...
If they had, I wouldn\'t be able to lock behind me after I left, and they\'d find that suspicious...
Anyway, I should leave this place.
Then I\'ll return to my room and pretend that I was sleeping the whole time...
That\'s right, I have to get back quickly...
A new murder has occurred.
{n}They\'ll probably try to tell me about it.
And they\'ll probably do it immediately after they carry Hideyoshi‐san\'s body back to the parlor.
I can get around a phone call by saying I was asleep and didn\'t notice, but if they come knocking directly, that\'ll be bad...
I have to get back quickly, before they try to force their way in......
I don\'t even know whether I should sprint back noisily to save every second I can, sneak back with hushed footsteps,
 or walk around normally as though I don\'t know anything has happened......!
The one thing I\'m certain of is that I have to avoid bumping into them on their way back to the parlor.
I have to get to my room......at a quick pace, without being noticed by anyone......!
I passed through the hall...
...to the lobby.
Once I\'ve ascended the main staircase in the lobby, ......I\'ll be almost there......
{a:c:
"Natsuhi‐san."}
"Hyeek......!!"
Just as she was about to go up the large staircase, Natsuhi heard Erika call out to her,
 and was so surprised that she visibly jumped.
"......I was just about to go tell you."
"Th‐thank you very much.
 Did something happen......?"
".........Natsuhi‐san, were you just...
going up the stairs...?
 Your room {i:is} upstairs, isn\'t it......?"
Erika coldly pointed out this strange fact.
{n}......Natsuhi cursed her bad luck.
"I, ...I couldn\'t sleep, so I was going to return to the parlor,
 ......b‐but I wasn\'t sure whether I had locked my room or not, so I was about to head back.
 ......I\'m a worrier, so this sort of thing happens a lot.
 Don\'t worry about it..."
"Ah, of course, that is quite common, isn\'t it?
 It\'s a common quirk among people who aren\'t confident in their ability to remember things."
Erika was clearly making fun of her, and Natsuhi might have put on an annoyed expression under normal circumstances.
However, right now,
 Natsuhi was extremely relieved to hear Erika admit that this was nothing out of the ordinary...
"Why are you by yourself, Erika‐san......?"
"I thought I might examine that guest room."
"Guest room......?"
"Yes.
 Things have gotten pretty serious, haven\'t they?
 And investigating the scene of the crime is my right."
......Erika\'s probing gaze peered deep into Natsuhi\'s eyes.
She could tell.
{n}Erika was already suspicious of Natsuhi.
......Judging by the subtle nuances of her words,
 this was almost certainly an attempt to make Natsuhi slip up and reveal that she knew about the Hideyoshi murder she hadn\'t yet been told about.
Natsuhi played dumb and asked again what had happened.
"..........................."
"..............................
 ......I‐...is something wrong...?"
"No, I was just thinking.
 ......This is a repeat of the first crime, isn\'t it?"
"What do you mean...?"
"Again, you were in your room.
 And again, you can\'t prove your alibi, can you?"
"......I don\'t know what you mean.
 To turn it around, how can you prove that I wasn\'t in my room...?"
"Oh, an interesting response.
 Then let\'s take this one step at a time.
 ......Please worry about your lock later.
 I have something vitally important to discuss with everyone."
"I\'ll come back after I check my lock.
 Please get started without me."
"......Hideyoshi‐san has been killed.
 We\'ll be talking about that."
"Wh‐.........what...?!"
She had planned on escaping to her own room using her lock as an excuse,
 ......claiming to have a sudden headache, and staying in bed the rest of the time.
However, now that she had been informed of Hideyoshi\'s murder,
 it would be clearly suspicious to say that could wait and escape to her room.
......She was already under suspicion after being seen heading up the stairs to the second floor.
She couldn\'t afford to do anything else suspicious......
Natsuhi gave up and headed for the parlor as Erika had urged her to do...
When she opened the door to the parlor, Eva\'s sobs poured out.
And everyone stared at Natsuhi with grave faces.
Those gazes almost made it look......as though they suspected her.
It was now painfully apparent to Natsuhi.
{n}This must have been what that man was after.
It was a trap to create a baffling locked‐room murder......and frame her for it.
But I couldn\'t disobey.
 I couldn\'t sacrifice my husband\'s life...!
And while it\'s true that I was hiding in the closet, that was all.
I haven\'t committed murder!
I might fall under enormous suspicion, but I\'m still not the culprit.
And most importantly, I\'m not under suspicion yet.
......I\'ll tell the police everything.
 I\'ll have to endure until then.
I\'m sure one of the servants is feeding information to the culprit.
Even in a situation like this, if I talk about my husband being a hostage,
 the culprit will hear, and it might be used as an excuse to kill him......
"Natsuhi‐san has just come back.
 Now that we\'re all here, I have something very important to discuss with you all."
"......Something very important......?"
"Yes, it\'s very important.
 ......Here in front of you all, I would like to set out the facts of everything that\'s happened, from the first crime to the last."
"Then you can leave me out of it, if you please.
 I think we should leave that sort of thing to the police.
 I\'m not interested."
"I have something very important to say once I\'ve cleared everything up.
 Neither you nor anyone else has the right to refuse."
"Wha............"
Erika used her detective\'s authority to proclaim the start of an assembly.
{n}None of the pieces could disobey.
Praying that she wouldn\'t become the topic of conversation, Natsuhi reluctantly sat on the sofa as she\'d been urged to.
".........Oh, sorry.
 Could you close that door for me?"
""Y‐yes...""
Shannon and Kanon closed the door.
......Since they had just now decided to lock all doors and windows carefully, Kanon locked it as well.
The lock which existed to protect the safety of this room...
felt like a lock on a prison cell to Natsuhi—one that would hold her there and prevent any escape......
......Natsuhi still hadn\'t noticed.
That ever since Erika had left into the corridor to go check the crime scene in Hideyoshi\'s room......her goal had changed.
In short, from Erika\'s point of view, the sound of that lock was truly...
"Checkmate."
Erika said that suddenly.
{f:5:Bernkastel} said that suddenly.
"Oh, fast!
 Wow, so you\'ve figured out the culprit already?
 We\'ve barely gotten to any of the crimes, you know?
 You could\'ve let me kill a few more and gathered all kinds of clu~es."
".........Alright, Lambda, gather all of the pieces.
 Now we\'re getting to the most entertaining part.
 Let\'s both enjoy it to the fullest."
"We\'ll see about that...
 Why don\'t you show me what you\'ve got?
 *giggle*giggle*...!!"
"To think that she\'d lay down the challenge without waiting for the game to be over at midnight...!
 What a hasty person, that Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}...!"
"It is quite an early challenge.
 To think that she already feels she can win at this stage..."
"......Claiming a witch exists is normally all you need to do to win,
 ......but with Natsuhi and Kinzo, we\'ve got a lot we need to protect this time.
 ......Sounds like this fight\'ll be a pain."
"I welcome a troublesome fight!
 I won\'t let them do as they please with my golden island any more...!!
 I shall meet your challenge, Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}!
 Furudo Erika!"
......In the Golden Land, the endless rain continued to fall.
Battler was nowhere to be seen.
It would very soon reach the time when Battler had joined in on the fifth game,
 and control of his piece would be passed on to him.
In other words, only now, in this final stage of the game when {f:5:Bernkastel} had pinpointed the culprit,
 was Battler finally going to be allowed to participate.
He had left the arbor a short while ago for that reason.
Now, the only ones in sight were {f:5:Virgilia}, who continued to knit silently,
 ......and Beato, ...who just sat there blankly amidst the smell of her black tea,
 not even putting the cup to her lips......
{f:5:Virgilia} stopped knitting for a moment...
...and looked out across the vast golden rose garden that extended as far as the eye could see.
"......At least in terms of mere culprit‐guessing games,
 ......I think we can say that Battler‐kun has gained the strength to never again surrender."
"......................................."
"You gave him every message he needs by the end of the fourth game.
 .........That is to say, ......Battler‐kun possesses all the tools to reach the truth at any moment.
 .........However, he has a weak side.
 ......Because of that,
 even if the game goes on to repeat a hundred times,
 he will never solve it.
 He\'ll just wander forever like someone trying to find the blue bird."
And that, ............{f:5:Beatrice},
 goes for you as well.
Even if you play this game hundreds more times,
 you will never arrive at the answer you seek.
{f:5:Bernkastel} will abuse this game without a doubt.
{f:5:Lambdadelta} will also churn this game about with the utmost arrogance.
At a glance, that may be humiliating and appear to you and Battler as though the game has been stolen from you.
.........However.
That is something the two of you need right now.
To bring an end to Battler\'s weak side.
 To bring an end to your hesitation.
"And that is why...
you called the two of them here.
 To end the eternal torture between the two of you."
"......................................."
"Those two will bring you either victory or defeat.
 But either result will now be one filled with compassion.
 .........You should understand that as well by now."
{f:5:Virgilia} faced Beato, whom she had come to adore like a daughter,
 ......with cold eyes that she must not have shown often.
It was like the gaze of a mother who, instead of scolding, silently urges their child to recognize their mistake.
"{f:5:Beatrice}.
 .........How long do you intend to stay there...
...neither alive...
nor dead,
 .........not ascending to heaven...
nor descending to hell,
 there in a daze on the peak of Mount Purgatory......?"
"......................................."
"I am {f:5:Virgilia}.
 I have guided him through Purgatory and brought him to you at its peak.
 ......And you are {f:5:Beatrice}.
 You must choose whether to take his hand and rise up to heaven, or embrace him and fall into hell."
Did you know that the tribulations of Purgatory, which lies in the gap between heaven and hell,
 are sometimes more torturous than even hell itself...?
On the gates of hell, it is written that you must abandon all hope.
......A human without hope can accept their suffering and give up.
However, the denizens of Purgatory have hope.
{n}A hope of possibly reaching heaven, a hope that cannot be abandoned.
And that tortures them.
Even in the depths of hell, ...no greater torture device exists than the single pin known as hope......
"Leap.
 Leap from the cliff of Purgatory.
 ......Cast open Pandora\'s box, and cast aside your fleeting, fragile, foolish hope and all the longing it brings.
 You\'re afraid, aren\'t you?
 Of opening the box."
Beato was silent,
 .........but with a single tear, she nodded slightly.
"Is the cat in the box alive or dead?
 The time has now come...to check.
 ......If the cat is dead, hold a funeral for it quickly and have it rise to heaven.
 If the cat is alive, feed it quickly and give it all of your affection."
"Whether it is alive or dead,
 your cat box eternally desecrates the cat.
 .........Those two have brought you the key to the box that you were too afraid to open."
{f:5:Beatrice}.
{n}The time has come for you to die.
I hope...
that your heart will be stopped...
...by the hand of the person you desire.
