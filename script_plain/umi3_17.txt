"Dad.........Mom......!!
 Who would do something like this...?!!
 Waaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aaahhh...!!"
Jessica\'s woeful voice echoed throughout the rose garden...
Perhaps it was the intuition of a person who lived on this island.
...After Jessica had looked in the rose garden where Auntie Rosa and Maria had fallen and seen nothing,
 she had gone to look in the arbor next.
Normally, the arbor was probably a wonderful location to enjoy tea peacefully while appreciating the roses on a good sunny day.
......Who knows, maybe even Uncle Krauss and Aunt Natsuhi...
had their days where they relaxed and enjoyed tea together there.
......In that arbor lay the bodies of Uncle Krauss and Aunt Natsuhi.
At least they weren\'t drenched in the rain like Auntie Rosa and Maria had been,
 but there was no way I could say that out loud to Jessica at that moment...
"......What do you think, Doctor Nanjo?"
"Str‐...strangulation, I believe.
 ...Take a look at this.
 On their necks, there are distinct markings that something thin was used to strangle them."
"Right.
 ......I doubt that these things were the primary cause of their deaths."
...The two stake‐like weapons decorated with an occult design that were lying on the ground...
had been found driven into Uncle Krauss\'s thigh area,
 and near Aunt Natsuhi\'s calf.
When we had found these sticking out of my parents\' forehead and chest,
 we had decided to leave them exactly as they were for the police and to preserve the crime scene,
 ......but Jessica no longer cared about such matters, and immediately pulled the stakes out of her parents\' forsaken bodies.
"......So we\'ve found all five gouged corpses now, in the head, chest, stomach, knee, and leg."
"Uuuuhhhghhhhuu, shit, shit shit!!
 I\'ll frickin\' kill that murderer, kill him!!
 UwaaAA{0}AAaa{0}aaHHH...!!"
"......Everything as far as the eighth twilight is finished now.
 ...Is this going to continue onto the ninth twilight?
 ......The witch revives, and none shall be left alive."
"Bring it on, dammit...
 ......When it says the witch revives,
 ...that means the culprit\'s gonna make his grand appearance, right?!"
"Bull{i:shit} no one\'s gonna be left alive...
 ......I\'ll kill him myself...!
 I\'ll make sure I kill whoever murdered Mom and Dad, with my own two hands...!!"
Jessica howled furiously, her emotions laid bare.
 ......To avoid being crushed by her grief, she could do nothing but resist it with anger.
".........We still...haven\'t found George.
 ...Jessica‐chan, and the rest of you, you can stay here if you want.
 I\'ll go to the mansion."
"E‐Eva‐san, we mustn\'t split up...!!
 It is dangerous if we do not all stick together...!"
"There\'s nothing we can do for Nii‐san or his wife.
 But George may be still alive somewhere...!
 I have no time to waste here...!!"
As Auntie Eva screamed this, Jessica glared at her.
...Auntie Eva had no more time to bother about the dead.
{n}She was more concerned for the safety of her only son, who was yet to be seen.
"Jessica‐chan, you should stay by your father and mother\'s side.
 I\'ll make a short trip to the mansion.
 Battler‐kun and Doctor Nanjo, you two can stay here with her as well."
After saying this and leaving no time for debate, Auntie Eva rushed out of the arbor.
I called out for her to stop, but there was no way she would listen.
...However, by now, being alone in this situation meant nothing short of death.
If we silently watched her leave, it would be the same as letting her die.
{n}As long as Auntie Eva was unwilling to stop, we would have no choice but to follow her.
......And, while it may be cruel to say so,
 Uncle Krauss and Aunt Natsuhi were already dead,
 so there was nothing more we could do for them...
In the end, we had no choice but to console Jessica and head for the mansion together.
...Fortunately, Jessica stood up.
Perhaps she had been able to draw a line under her grief for the moment.
 ......But, what had surfaced in its place was an expression like a demon.
"...I\'ll murder \'em with my own hands, ......I\'ll avenge my parents, just you wait.........
 ......Let\'s go, Battler.
 If we find whoever did this, don\'t get in my way.
 I\'m definitely gonna kill them...!!"
".........I also have my parents to avenge.
 Sorry, but this is first come, first served."
"...Yeah, ...that\'s right...
 ......Let\'s make mincemeat of that bastard!"
At my words, Jessica finally seemed to feel like someone had sympathized with her emotions.
She still had that dark expression, but I felt Jessica regaining some of her sanity.
We took off.
{n}Chasing after Auntie Eva.
Through the rose garden,
 up the stone steps,
 running at full speed towards the mansion......whose large, intimidating shadow flashed in the lightning.
......With this, the epitaph murders had finished the eighth twilight.
{n}And now, on the ninth twilight, the witch will revive.
{n}...None shall be left alive.
I will most likely lose my life.
......But at the very least, I wanted to burn the truth into my eyes.
{n}That was the only thing motivating me to move at that moment.
We were able to reunite with Auntie Eva, who was having trouble with the lock to the front door.
It seemed that all the blood had risen to Auntie Eva\'s head.
{n}That was probably making her fingers clumsy.
It seemed she couldn\'t even handle the simple task of inserting the key into the lock.
...Then, there was a faint sound.
The sound of the door unlocking.
 Just as though it had waited for all of the survivors to unite before opening.
......It seemed to me as though the malicious mansion...
was trying to swallow all of the remaining humans at once...
The stench that erupted outwards at the instant the door opened,
 ...could it really be explained as just a smell?
It wasn\'t just the charred smell from Grandfather.
......I think it may also have contained something like...
regrets, held by so many dead, including our parents, and all of the servants.
...What did it mean as it billowed out, overwhelming us?
......Was it the cry of the dead, telling us not to enter?
However, Auntie Eva didn\'t even flinch at something like that.
......And we who had to chase after her...
were forced to step into the mansion, despite receiving that message...
"George?!
 George!!
 If you can hear me, answer!
 Geoooooorge!!"
Auntie Eva shouted at the top of her lungs.
......Considering the situation, it\'s probably far too optimistic to imagine that he\'s alive.
When we also started following Auntie Eva\'s example and calling George‐aniki\'s name in loud voices...
...Auntie Eva found something, and stopped walking.
She was standing in front of the door to the parlor.
".........What is this.........?
 D‐Doctor Nanjo, could you come here for a second......?"
"Wh‐what is it......?"
I had heard from the adults about the creepy magic circles that had been drawn on doors such as the one to the parlor.
......Creepy was the only word to describe that thing,
 which had been scrawled there with a deep‐red paint reminiscent of blood that slowly dripped down.
However, that had supposedly been there since this morning.
......Wondering why Auntie Eva, who had seen it already,
 would think it odd now, Jessica and I stared at the door...
"......Certainly, .........I have no memory of numbers such as these being written here."
"Right, they weren\'t.
 ......The creepy magical text was written here, but not the numbers."
From what the two of them said, only a magic circle had been there here this morning.
However, right now, there were eight digits newly written in the upper part of the magic circle.
07151129.
...I didn\'t know what it meant,
 but I didn\'t even want to imagine the thought process of whoever wrote this.
It was drawn with what was probably the same paint as the magic circle,
 ...but it had clearly been written very recently.
The way it had dried and the condition of the color was completely different from the magic circle part.
".........pfeh.
 I\'m sure it just has some magical meaning.
 It\'s pointless to rack our brains over it."
Jessica intentionally spat those words out in an attempt to wipe out how creepy it was.
"It...could be a magic {i:square}.
 ......The idea that a ward against evil can reside in a certain form of number play.
 I am sure you have all heard of the one where adding all of the numbers in each row leads to the same sum..."
"Wasn\'t that a group of numbers filled inside a square?
 This is just a single row.
 I don\'t have a clue what it could mean."
"......What Jessica‐chan said is probably correct.
 There isn\'t any point in us thinking about it deeply..."
Even though she said that, she probably suspected that it might actually mean something.
Using an old receipt or something from inside her pocket,
 Auntie Eva deftly wrote that number down with a short ballpoint pen.
Because an eight‐digit number would probably be a little difficult to memorize, unless it had some kind of pattern.
.................................
"......Couldn\'t...
...this be a date,
 ......or something?"
"A date...?
 What are you talking about...?"
"Well, ...it\'s probably a coincidence,
 but my birthday...
is July 15th.
 ...Once I thought that 0715 might refer to July 15th,
 I figured that if 1129 stood for November 29th, maybe that\'d fit perfectly..."
"............Why would your birthday be written in a place like this?
 And what\'s up with November 29th...?"
"That\'s what I wanna know...
 Still, ...it\'s probably just a coincidence.
 When I thought about it, it started to feel a little creepy."
"......Is November 29th someone\'s birthday or something?
 It\'s not anyone in my family, not Dad or Kyrie‐san or Ange.
 And of course, not my mom either."
"I cannot think of anything...
 ...I don\'t believe it is Kinzo‐san\'s or Genji‐san\'s birthday."
"It isn\'t from my family either.
 And it isn\'t Rosa\'s or Maria‐chan\'s."
"It\'s not anyone in mine, either...
 And it isn\'t Kanon‐kun\'s or Shannon\'s."
"......I always give the servants presents on their birthdays, so I know it for all of them,
 but I don\'t know anyone who was born on November 29th..."
Once we started imagining that the eight digits, which we had thought were meaningless,
 were actually two dates written together, it really started to look that way.
......However, its true meaning may be something completely different, or there may be no meaning at all.
Anyway, since we don\'t have any real clue, it\'s probably pointless to stand around here analyzing it.
......More important was the inside of the parlor.
This morning, behind each of the doors with a magic circle drawn on them, there had been the body of a victim.
...And now that a number had been newly added to the door, what new thing {i:had been added} inside the parlor?
When Auntie Eva tried to open it, she felt the resistance of the lock.
{n}She immediately took out a master key, and put it in the keyhole.
As soon as she opened the door, ......Auntie Eva let out a high‐pitched scream and ran inside.
That alone was enough to tell us what had happened inside the room...
Doctor Nanjo and I looked at each other, and I shook my head slightly as we entered the parlor...
"George!!
 Geooooorge!!
 Speak to me...!!
 Geoooooooooorge!!
 Doctor Nanjo, quickly!!"
George‐aniki had fallen alongside Shannon‐chan\'s body.
His chest was stained bright red.
 And from his still‐opened eyes,
 ...all my condolences to Auntie Eva,
 ......but I couldn\'t pick up any signs of life.
After moving to take his pulse,
 ...Doctor Nanjo shook his head, wordlessly reporting that George‐aniki was dead.
Brushing him aside, Auntie Eva once again crouched beside George‐aniki,
 and started crying at the top of her lungs...
With this, ...Aniki\'s death, one thing had become certain.
The murders would not be ending at the eighth twilight.
The epitaph was going to be carried out in its complete form, including the ninth twilight, "and none will be left alive"...
I\'m really starting to lose the plot.
...For some reason, Auntie Eva\'s half‐insane cries and appearance actually made me cool down...
...Crestfallen and exhausted, I flopped onto the sofa,
 and plunked my feet on top of the table.
Maybe all of these murders have paralyzed my heart.
 ......Instead of fright, the stronger emotion I\'m feeling is one of complete confusion.
Dad and Kyrie‐san have died, and starting with the servants, people have been killed off one by one.
 ...And at one hell of a pace, too.
I don\'t know what time the first murders started,
 ...but I\'d say we\'re probably being killed at a rate of about one person an hour.
We believe that the boat will come for us around nine tomorrow.
 ......There\'s still a full twelve hours until then.
...How many more sacrifices to the witch would there have to be for us to survive...?
With the four of us, if one goes each hour, ...we won\'t last any longer than four hours.
 It\'s not clear anymore if we\'ll even last until midnight tonight...
......Yesterday, after lunch, we came into this parlor.
At about the time that the discussion had turned to the black tea that Auntie Rosa said she bought,
 we kids had started talking about going to take a walk.
......Maria was fooling around.
...Didn\'t Shannon‐chan bring us some cookies?
She said that Kumasawa‐san had baked them, or something.
......I\'d probably have laughed my ass off if there had actually been a cooked mackerel one mixed in with them.
............That\'s right, I\'ll never hear Kumasawa baa‐chan\'s mackerel jokes again, will I...
...Oh yeah, if I only remember stuff about Kumasawa baa‐chan, that wouldn\'t be fair to everyone else...
.........Why did Dad and Kyrie‐san...even go outside?
It\'s not like we\'d die from being without food for a day.
...So why did gluttony get ahold of them and make them go to get food?
......I\'ll bet it was my fearless dad who started complaining about being hungry...
Kyrie‐san, you were supposed to be the brakes for my reckless dad...
 Why didn\'t you stop him?
.........And what about your daughter Ange...?
...She\'s only six years old.
{n}You weren\'t thinking of entrusting her to me, were you...?
At this point, it\'s doubtful that even I will be able to leave this island alive.........
"St‐stop this...!!
 Why are you fighting at a time such as this...?!
 Jessica‐san, stop...!!"
......Some kind of commotion was interrupting my thoughts.
I looked up to see what it was, and saw that Jessica and Auntie Eva had started fighting each other at some point.
......No, maybe I should say that Jessica was grabbing at Auntie Eva.
"......You killed my mom and dad!!
 There\'s no other explanation!!"
"Don\'t be stupid!!
 How would I know anything about what happened to your parents?!"
"Who was downstairs in the guesthouse?!
 You were!!
 Mom and Dad were in the downstairs lobby, along with YOU!
 Who was left alive?!
 Only YOU!!
 Why?"
"Because you\'re the {i:fucking murderer}, that\'s why goddammit!!
 You killed Mom and Dad, carried them outside, and then shamelessly locked the door,
 trying to make it seem like it was the frickin\' witch\'s doing...!!"
"Then why did George go missing?!
 He didn\'t come downstairs, you know?!
 So did he disappear from upstairs?!"
"Who was upstairs?!
 It was you people who were up there!!
 You knew, didn\'t you?!
 You knew that George slipped out of the mansion!!
 You brazenly made a face as if you didn\'t know anything!!
 If you had stopped George, he would, ......he would...!!!"
"I am telling you to stop...!
 Jessica‐san was in the cousins\' room the whole time!
 And Eva‐san was also in the downstairs lobby the whole time!
 And neither of you are responsible for anything!
 This is only the sadness of losing your family...!!"
"The culprit is no one, is nowhere...!!
 It is all.........just the witch\'s fault, that is all!!
 So you two, please, stop hating one another...!!"
......The witch\'s fault, is it...
{n}I wonder if that\'s a good way to mediate things for now.
Yes, ...I finally understand the meaning of all of the doors and windows having been {i:locked from the inside} when three whole people evaporated from the guesthouse...
This is what they were after.
......Making us think the culprit was inside, ...and causing this ugly mutual hatred...
....had to be the culprit\'s......the witch\'s goal.
............But in that case, how had the culprit {i:locked it from the outside}...?
It\'s certainly true that the master key had been stolen when Dad\'s group was attacked.
...But the doors and windows to the guesthouse...
had been constructed so that you couldn\'t lock them from the outside no matter how hard you tried.
So that master key shouldn\'t mean anything for the guesthouse locked room...
......Jessica and Auntie Eva were turning their sadness at losing their blood relatives into anger at the person in front of them.
Doctor Nanjo was trying to step between them.
......And I sat haphazardly in a sofa staring up at the ceiling,
 ......thinking about things that didn\'t even matter anymore with a worn‐out expression.
............I just couldn\'t believe that this was the same parlor that had been so warm and pleasant midday yesterday,
 ...for just a short time before the typhoon hit......
"GYAAAAaAAaaAAAaaaAAA......
uWAA{0}AAuu{0}ughhaAA{0}AAUU{0}UUgghh{0}hhh...!!"
The sudden sound of a gunshot shook me out of my half‐asleep trance.
...Smoke was rising out of the barrel of the gun Auntie Eva held.
Jessica was rolling around on the floor, covering both her eyes.
Auntie Eva and Doctor Nanjo were looking down at her, shocked...
"A‐are you alright, Jessica‐san...?!
 Jessica‐san...!!"
"UuuAaaaAAAaaaaHHHaHHHhhh,
 oww, owwww, ow...
uuuaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aaggghhh...!"
"I‐......it isn\'t my fault...
 Th‐......this happened because you came at me even after I told you to stop...!"
"H‐...hey, hey, what the hell happened, what\'s going on...?!"
Jessica had grabbed at Auntie Eva, and it had turned into a scuffle...
They had then...started fighting over the gun Auntie Eva had been holding?
And some movement or other caused the trigger to be pulled...?
I didn\'t know the details, about whether the bullet had grazed her, or whether she had been burned by the discharge,
 but whatever the case, Jessica was covering both of her eyes, screaming in pain, and rolling around on the floor.
"......It\'s alright, calm down...!
 It is not a serious wound, so get ahold of yourself...!"
"My eyes hurt, it hurts...
 ...I can\'t see,
 ...I can\'t see......!!"
Doctor Nanjo lent Jessica his shoulder, saying that he would tend to her in the servant room.
......The servant room in this mansion apparently had a bed and a first aid kit, and was able to function as an infirmary.
"Damn iiiiiit!!
 You killed Mom and Dad!!
 I\'ll kill you... I\'ll kill you......!!"
"I‐......it wasn\'t me... It wasn\'t me......!!"
"Jessica‐san, you are aggravating the wound, so please, stop struggling...!
 Come, let us go to the servant room..."
Jessica still continued to curse Auntie Eva as her parents\' murderer.
{n}It seemed that Auntie Eva couldn\'t conceal her shock at the fact that she had pulled the trigger, even if it had been an accident.
"...It wasn\'t my fault... That kid jumped at me, that\'s why this happened......
 ......I didn\'t kill anyone..."
"......No, forget that... Who killed George?
 That\'s right, who killed George?!!
 George, Geooooooooooorge!!
 It isn\'t my fault, it isn\'t my fault...!!"
"W‐wait a sec, Auntie Eva...!!
 Don\'t go off on your own!!"
I didn\'t know whether it was because Auntie Eva couldn\'t stand her mistake,
 or whether it was because she had lost herself to anger at the person who had killed her only son,
 ...or whether it was both of those all mixed together.
...In any case, she ran out into the corridor, yelling, fearful, and shouting.
I was also worried about Jessica\'s condition, but anyway, right then, I couldn\'t leave Auntie Eva alone.
Why would she go off on her own in this mansion, of all places? Is she suicidal...?!
Doctor Nanjo took Jessica towards the servant room.
...I chased after Auntie Eva, dashing into the depths of the mansion......
After sitting Jessica on the servant room bed,
 Nanjo told her several times not to rub her eyes, and examined the affected area.
The barrel had probably been near her eyes.
{n}There was a possibility that the flames from the discharge had damaged her corneas.
...There was no threat to her life, but it would probably be necessary to have a suitable doctor look at her as soon as humanly possible.
Nanjo applied emergency first aid, covering the affected area with gauze and wrapping it with a bandage.
 As a result, Jessica completely lost her field of vision...
"Now, pay attention...
 This wound may hurt or itch, but you must not scratch at it or rub it.
 When tomorrow comes, let us go to an ophthalmologist as soon as possible."
"......That bitch, ...she really was trying to kill me...
 If the angle had been just a little bit off, I\'d have been killed by now...
 I\'ll definitely turn her in to the police......!"
"...Eva‐san would not do such a thing.
 That was an accident."
"Accident my ass...!
 She killed Mom and Dad.
 There\'s no way any 19th person or witch exists on this island...!!
 She\'s behind everything.
 She was the only one on the first floor of the guesthouse!"
"George nii‐san must have seen her kill Mom and Dad, and she killed him to keep him silent!!
 It\'s the same with Grandfather and the servants.
 I\'m sure she snuck out of the family conference last night and killed all of them...!!"
"......I‐if that is the case, then we will know as soon as the police investigate."
"The police are incredible, you know—there is nothing that cannot be understood by a forensic investigator.
 ......There is no need for us to suspect or hate anyone.
 The police will resolve everything."
"So for now, Jessica‐san, you should concentrate on resting your body and making things easy on your eyes.
 ...If you wrinkle your forehead too much, it will do no good for your eyes, of course, and nothing for your looks either."
Indeed, when Jessica had grown agitated in her verbal abuse of Eva,
 she had naturally started glaring, and the pressure on her eyes hurt her.
Jessica herself soon realized that the more she talked, the more the wound would hurt,
 and regardless of whether she had overcome her suspicions of Eva, she regained her composure for the time being...
"......She killed them...
 ......Mom and Dad.
 ......And Shannon,
 .........and Kanon‐kun...
 ............Kanon‐kun........."
She had heard that Kanon had been killed in the chapel.
{n}...Jessica still hadn\'t seen his face after he had died.
Jessica was now less fearful about the fact that she might go blind,
 and more frightened that the police would carry Kanon\'s corpse away while she still couldn\'t see,
 and that she would have to say her final farewell without being able to see his face.
Her anger at the culprit, and her sadness at the death of the person she had liked.
{n}...Those mixed emotions provoked her tear ducts.
But right now, tears were actually painful for her,
 so she wasn\'t even permitted to leisurely remember the late Kanon\'s face...
Jessica could do nothing but sit on the bed and let her head droop, withstanding the pain...
"..................
 ...Well, now it is Eva‐san I must be concerned for.
 I hope she isn\'t too shaken by this."
Letting out a small sigh of relief that Jessica had calmed down for the time being,
 he stuck his head out into the hallway to look for any sign of the others coming back.
"..............."
They...met eyes.
{n}Nanjo, unable to understand who this person was, was bewildered for an instant.
"I hear that people who have lost the power of sight have zero anti‐magic power and zero magic resistance.
 In other words, you\'re an isolated pawn right now.
 Understand what that meeeans?"
"......Wh‐......what did you say......?"
There was no possible way that Nanjo could have understood who the person in front of him was.
 ...And there was certainly no possible way that he could ever have understood what she had just said.
".........Doctor Nanjo?
 What\'s going on......?"
Unable to see, Jessica couldn\'t tell what was going on except by whatever voice she heard.
{n}...But since she had heard Nanjo say something with an uneasy tone,
 she tightened up, thinking that something bad might have happened.
"S‐......stop, please......!
 Please don\'t kill me...!!
 I have a sick grandchild...!
 I can\'t die here...!
 For mercy\'s sake, spare me...!!
 HIIIii!!!"
"...Doctor Nanjo...?
 Doctor Nanjo?!"
Jessica couldn\'t do anything except call out from the bed.
{n}...Judging by the tone of his voice, Nanjo was in the corridor, being confronted by someone.
And he was scared.
 There was no doubt that at this very moment, his life was being threatened.
"No, don\'t!!
 HiiiIIIIiIIIII!!!"
"On the ninth twilight, the witch revives, and none shall be left alive.
 Kuhhihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihihi!!"
The witch pointed the end of her gold staff at Nanjo.
...Even though he didn\'t know what she was planning to do,
 Nanjo imagined that she must be trying to take his life.
"Doctor Nanjo!!
 Doctor Nanjo!!
 Who\'s out there?!
 Answer me!!"
"Please, nooooOoOOOo, ahii{0}ie{0}eeEAAH{0}HHhhh!!"
Bang!
 A sharp sound echoed.
And tapered to a point just as sharp, the elongated tip of the golden staff was stuck straight into Nanjo\'s forehead...
Jessica, who only had her ears to help her try to grasp what was happening, had no clue what was going on.
...But even so, she was able to realize that with that sound, Nanjo had died.
And the person who had killed him was now in the corridor, right in front of the servant room.
{n}...Furthermore, since she couldn\'t see, she wouldn\'t even be able to run away, much less resist.
...Upon discovering that she was in a life‐or‐death situation, caught like a rat in a trap, Jessica felt her blood run cold...
"......Oh, Jessica.
 Poor girl, you injured your eyes.
 ...In that case, you can\'t even escape, can you?
 *giggle*giggle*giggle*.
 ...I\'m gonna play a whole lot with Nanjo\'s corpse now.
 ...When I get bored of that, I\'ll kill you next and play a bunch more."
"......No, wait, it\'s not every day that you get blinded, right?
 ......I won\'t wait until I kill you.
 I\'ll play with you a bunch {i:before} I kill you too.
 ...Kuhhihya{0}hya{0}hya{0}hya...!!
 So wait there shaking for a while, okay?
 As you try to imagine all the ways I\'m playing with Nanjo\'s corpse!!"
"H‐...hiiiiiiiiiiiiii!!!"
Struck with fear, Jessica let out a frail scream.
......She really wanted to scream in a much louder voice, trying to get someone to help her.
But she couldn\'t.
When a person is faced with true fear, it clogs up their throat...
Right now, Jessica could barely even breathe.
"H‐
......help...
 ......Help.........!!
 HiIIiiIiiIIi!!"
She searched around with her hands, trying to find some way to escape.
 But even though she knew this room well, just being unable to see made it like a locked room of darkness.
She bumped into some shelves or something, and some tins of sweets and bottles and things fell down from them, hitting her on the head.
...As she was now, even protecting her head to block them wasn\'t working out.
...She was becoming painfully aware of how very powerless humans become just by losing their sense of sight.
{n}Of course, she had no time to appreciate that.
She crawled around, as best as she could, trying to escape that place,
 but she kept bumping into things that she didn\'t understand, getting hit by various falling objects,
 and it felt to her like the entire room was alive, bullying her and refusing to let her escape.
Then, she heard footsteps from the presence in the hallway.
{n}And then a voice.
......The person had probably peered into the room since Jessica was making so much noise.
"What a racket you\'re making.
 Sit on the bed and wait quietly like a lady.
 \'Cause I\'ll give you a wonderful blood‐red death costume fitting for a lady of class.
 ......Something good enough to make the person who finds you faint, okay?
 Gehhe{0}he{0}he{0}he{0}he{0}he{0}he{0}he{0}heh!!"
"Hii...hiiIIiiIIIIiiiiiiIIIi!!"
Just a short while ago, she had sworn that she would kill the culprit if she found them.
...However, she was now all too powerless.
She couldn\'t do anything except let out feeble screams and crawl around on the floor, bumping her head into the bed and the legs of desks.
"Help... Help......!
 Someone, help......!!
 Dad, ......Mom...!
 Battleeeer......!
 Someone, coooooooome...!!
 .........Help me, ......Kanon‐kun.........!!"
In the corridor, as the witch thought of how to toy with Nanjo\'s life...
......a single gold butterfly secretly watched that scene from the corner of the hallway.
...It was Beato, who had barely escaped with her life once before.
The gold butterfly softly returned to human form.
 ...Its form was faint and transparent like a lace curtain.
Even just the power to hold a human form had become scarce for her.
Right next to her, Ronove also appeared.
"......Jessica will probably be unable to survive.
 ...Although, no one was to be left alive since the beginning."
"..................She has grown feelings of love for Kanon.
 ......I have even toyed with that at times.
 ............However, I know that now to be something shameful for a witch."
"......Love is the single element.
 Romantic love is even more pure, more sacred.
 ...Though, for some reason, you hate it very much, Milady."
".................................
 ......Master told me.
 ...Magic exists to bring people happiness.
 ...I\'m sure that I knew that once."
"......And from the moment I forgot that, I was no longer a witch.
 ......So I...lost the qualifications to be Battler\'s opponent..."
".........Milady, I hesitate to ask, but...
...surely you do not intend to rescue Jessica?
 That would be dangerous."
"I understand...
 Even if I save her, she will become a plaything of the witch\'s banquet when the door to the Golden Land opens."
"......But even so, ...that would be much more compassionate than the way that person would kill her.
 ...The witch\'s banquet steals lives in a terrible way, but it does not do so more than once.
 It does not toy with life and death."
"...However, she is different.
 She kills over and over.
 She kills for fun!
 There is not even a trace of compassion there.
 .........I want to at least save Jessica from that kind of cruel fate."
"......Certainly, by carrying that out, you would probably be praised as a good witch."
"......However, the new {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama already views you as hostile, Milady.
 ...If you were to be seen by her again, ......you are aware, you would have no way to escape this time?"
".......................................
 ......When I reunited George with Shannon,
 .........I finally understood what a witch is,
 and what magic is."
".........I am a witch.
 I must be a witch.
 And I must be acknowledged by Battler as his opponent, ......and I must make him accept me as a witch this time at last."
"......The road to that goal may be long and difficult.
 ...However, if I do not take a step forward here and now, ......I cannot call myself a witch."
"I understand your feelings, but how do you plan to rescue her?
 There are not many forms of magic that your body is capable of now, Milady.
 Did you not have to borrow George\'s power even back when you revived Shannon?"
"......Mm.
 ...And for that very reason, I may be able to save Jessica at least."
"......Right now, she is begging for Kanon to save her.
 ......If I can borrow the power of that emotion, I may be able to knock on the doors of Hades once again with my magical power."
"I am sure you would be able.
 However, you would use up all of your magical power.
 ......If you were to be spotted by the new {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama, you would truly be without a method of escape."
"...I am no longer your butler, Milady.
 ......Understand that I cannot assist you if the situation worsens."
"...I know.
 .........By now, I have toyed with and taken more lives than I can count.
 ...So I may not be able to compensate for that sin except by saving the same number of lives."
"......I have nothing to lose in the first place.
 ...I am just a golden butterfly who has passed its name and magic power on, and who is no longer accepted as a witch."
".........What about Battler‐sama?
 You are part‐way through a game with him.
 He has said that he would wait until you returned, Milady."
"...Is it alright for you to expire here?
 ...You have a duty to return to the seat across from Battler‐sama, Milady."
"For that very reason...!
 If there is a life that only I can save, I choose to save it."
"And I will be accepted as a witch.
 ......I must be a witch...!
 If this is a test, it is a very childish one, unfitting for the evils I have committed until now."
"......Go, hide yourself, Ronove.
 Watch what may be the final magic of a single butterfly who used to be called a Golden Witch...!"
"......Certainly.
 ......Please show me magic...
...that will not disgrace the name of the Golden Witch.
 ......I pray that it will not be your last."
"Go, my friend.
 ...If there is enough ink, pen the story of my foolish life, and hand it to some fool attempting to walk the same path.
 Farewell, Ronove...!"
"Kanon‐kun,
 ......where are you...
where are you......
 ...Help me,
 ......help me...
 ...uuuu...u...uuuu..."
.........Milady.
 I am always...waiting by your side.
"K‐......Kanon‐kun......?
 Kanon‐kun......?!"
Jessica thought that she had just heard Kanon\'s voice.
 She looked around with unseeing eyes, but of course, there was no way for her to see anything.
...On the contrary, that action caused her head to hit the desk again.
"......Kanon‐kun, .........Kanon‐kun......
 ...Help me, .........help me........."
Yes, Milady.
 ...I will...help you.
"K‐......Kanon‐kun...?!
 Y‐you were alive...?!"
This time, she thought that she had heard his voice clearly.
{n}Jessica jumped up in surprise, banging her head against the desk once again.
......Milady, please calm your heart and listen.
...Unfortunately, I am not alive.
".........Huh......?"
I have already...died.
......However, ...that witch came to me to tell me of your peril.
...Then, she gave me only a short period of time to help you, Milady.
Please, calm your heart even more.
If you do, ......my form will become visible even to you, Milady...
Jessica obeyed those words.
{n}She chased all idle thoughts from her head, and relaxed her breathing.
......Her heart actually felt like it was going to explode after hearing the voice of the loved one she thought was dead.
She resisted that with all of her strength.
......When she did, ......she could feel that Kanon‐kun really was right in front of her.
......Even though she was unable to see, ......somehow, she was still able to sense him clearly.
"......Can you...see me?
 Milady..."
"Yeah...
 I can see, ......I can definitely see you, Kanon‐kun..."
".........I exist only as a spirit.
 So I cannot touch you, Milady.
 I cannot do anything except talk to you like this.
 ......I am a weak existence which can do nothing more than that, ...but I should be able to be of some aid to you, Milady."
"......Just words, ......that\'s all......?
 I can\'t......touch you, Kanon‐kun......?"
"I am now even more fragile than smoke from a candle.
 ...So much so, that if one of the living such as you were to touch me, I would be wiped away instantly.
 ......So please, don\'t try to touch me.
 ...Because I am also......holding back my desire......to touch you, Milady."
"Ah, .........y‐...yeah..."
"More importantly, Milady.
 ......Please listen well.
 .........The new Golden Witch is the owner of a cruel heart.
 ...She will surely try to make you meet with a horrible end.
 ......You must escape from this room and hide."
"H‐...how...?
 I can\'t...see anything......!"
"Quiet...
 ......I will be your eyes, Milady.
 Please move in accordance with my instructions.
 ......First, please crawl three steps from there, and then stand up.
 You are currently under the desk, Milady.
 If you stand there, you\'ll hit your head."
"...Th‐that was under the desk...?
 I got it... One, two, three...
 ...Standing up..."
"Well done......
 Next, please turn towards nine o\'clock.
 .........Yes, well done."
"Ha, ......haha...
 This is pretty...embarrassing...
 ......Ah, ...ack, ...owowow..."
"Are you alright? Does your wound hurt...?"
"N‐No, ...I\'m fine...
 What next......?"
Jessica thought that if this was a dream, she didn\'t want to wake up.
{n}...And, if she were allowed to, she would have wanted to take off the bandage covering her eyes and see him.
...However, if she did that, surely Kanon would vanish like frail candle smoke, just like he himself had said...
 ......She was afraid of that.
So she satisfied herself with just being able to hear his words once more,
 repressing her desire to see him, to hold him.
So what hurt her eyes now were tears of gratitude.
{n}......Tears of gratitude for the god, ...or else witch, who had given her this miraculous moment.
"...Is this okay...?
 If we keep talking like this, won\'t we be noticed by her?
 Won\'t our voices be heard...?"
"......I have erected a stealth barrier.
 If you don\'t make any loud noises or speak noisily, no one will notice.
 ......That is why no one can notice my presence."
"...I, ...I don\'t really get it, ...but anyway, we\'ll be okay as long as we stay quiet, right...?
 ......Wh‐what should I do next...?"
"Please walk ten steps, slowly, in the direction you\'re facing.
 You will touch the sofa.
 Please continue along that.
 ......Do it slowly.
 ......Stay calm.
 Believe my words."
"Su‐......sure.
 ............Heheh, ...it\'s weird...
 ......Even though it was so scary not being able to see, .........when you\'re with me, Kanon‐kun, it isn\'t scary at all..."
".........Yes, that is the sofa.
 Trace it to the left while advancing slowly...
 There is a table just to the left.
 Be careful not to bump into it with your shins..."
......It was a very, very peculiar and magical team effort.
Even though she would be killed in an instant if she was noticed by the terrible witch,
 ......there was no fear in Jessica\'s heart right then.
She was being protected and guided by Kanon, who she had thought she would never be able to meet with again.
...It was probably only a momentary miracle.
{n}......But even so, Jessica was deeply grateful for it.
If she hoped for too much, she was sure that he would disappear—so, in order not to break this transient miracle...
...and in order to engrave this moment into her heart for all eternity...{0}she slowly...{0}slowly...{0}continued to walk...{0}obeying Kanon\'s voice...
"......Alright, if you walk ten more steps, you will exit the servant room.
 Then, please turn to face nine o\'clock, and keep walking very slowly.
 Put your hand on the wall to your right, and keep on following that.
 ...I will take you to a safe room."
"............If I go there,
 ...will you...
.........leave me again, Kanon‐kun......?"
"..........................."
Kanon didn\'t answer.
{n}...But even his lack of an answer was enough to let her know that was the truth.
"......Then, ......no.
 .........I don\'t want to go..."
"If you stay here, you will be killed by the witch."
"That\'s alright...
 If I\'m killed, I can go to the world where you are, Kanon‐kun..."
"......Milady,
 please be reasonable.
 ......For the dead such as myself, the human world is too bright and painful...
 So I cannot stay for long."
"So Milady, ......with the time I am allowed, ......please permit me to guide you to a safe place.
 ............And after that, .........I will stay with you until my time runs out."
".........Is that...the best you can do, Kanon‐kun......?"
"...Yes.
 .........And in exchange, I will stay by your side for every second I can, Milady.
 ......The whole time, I will be with you, ......and I will talk with you, Milady."
"Talk...about what...?"
"..................What would you like me to talk about...?"
"...Anything...that you\'re willing to..."
"......Well then...
 ............I will tell you the story of a cowardly servant boy without courage.
 .........About a foolish and pitiful boy who felt love for a lady as radiant as the sun, ...and who, even though those same feelings were confessed to him,
 ......lost to his cowardice, and in the end, was not able to be true to himself while he still lived."
"...............Yeah...
 Then, ...I want to tell one too.
 .........The story of a cowardly girl, ......who couldn\'t muster her courage...
...to keep telling the boy she loved just how much she loved him."
"......And, ......about how God gave her a miracle to be reunited with that boy,
 ............and how, when she was given one more chance to muster up her courage, .........she did."
".........I also......want to hear that.
 ......So, for that reason as well, let us go.
 ......To a safe place."
"......Yeah...
 If I could be with you, Kanon‐kun, I would walk however long, however far...
 I don\'t need eyes anymore.
 If you told me to step forward, I would even take a step off a cliff."
"Thank you.
 ...Well then, Milady.
 Let us go.
 The first ten steps."
"No... Not like that.
 ...Not unless you call me............Jessica."
"......Understood.
 .....................Well then, Jessica.
 ...Take the first ten steps."
"Yeah.
 Kanon‐kun......"
Quietly, quietly, Jessica and Kanon snuck slowly out of the servant room.
Directly around the corner, the witch could be seen cruelly looking down upon Nanjo\'s corpse,
 but the witch did not even notice their presence.
However, Ronove, who was waiting at her side, met Kanon\'s eyes.
...Kanon thought "oh no", grimacing and blocking Jessica with his back.
"........................"
However, Ronove did not inform his master.
As though it had been his imagination that he ever spotted him in the first place, he pretended to know nothing.
......No, maybe he did appear to chuckle.
From a finger on one of Ronove\'s hands, which were joined behind his back, a single small gold butterfly appeared,
 flying in front of Kanon as though guiding him.
It was undetectable by the master he served.
Kanon was surprised at the magic that butterfly held.
Because it was far more powerful than the stealth barrier Kanon had.
...He may not have known, but that power had originally been Ronove\'s.
...An imitation of that had been given to Kanon by Kinzo, and that was what Kanon was using now.
As that butterfly of stealth magic scattered gold scales, it grew smaller bit by bit.
 ...It probably wouldn\'t last long.
......But without a doubt, even that would buy them enough time to get far away from the cruel witch.
"Alright, Milady...
 Let\'s follow that wall and keep walking.
 ...On and on.
 And on."
"Yeah.
 ......If I can be with you, Kanon‐kun, ......I\'ll keep on walking, on and on, as far as you want to go..."
Led and protected by the small gold butterfly,
 ...the two who were separated by the wall between life and death slowly walked away towards the end of the corridor...
......There was no way that the evil witch would have any magic to notice their flight.
Until they had already disappeared down the other end of the corridor, the witch never noticed that Jessica had vanished...
By the time the gold butterfly that Ronove had cast out evaporated completely, ...Jessica had reached the parlor.
Even though she would have been able to make it this far in no time if she had been able to see, as she was now, it had been a long, long adventure.
"......Now, Milady.
 We\'ve reached the parlor.
 I will now take you to the bundle of curtains by the window.
 ...If you hide in there, you\'ll surely be safe."
"Inside the curtains...
 Not bad.
 I used to hide in there a lot, long ago."
".........{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama..."
"...Huh?"
Kanon called the witch\'s name.
 Jessica looked around in surprise, but being unable to see, she obviously couldn\'t find the witch...
Beato had appeared once again with a faint form.
{n}Kanon squared off against the evil witch, but Beato\'s expression was soft, ...and actually pitying.
"I don\'t understand what kind of whim drove you to revive me... Your feelings elude me."
"......It was a whim and nothing more.
 ......No, ......this is how witches should be.
 ...It took me one thousand years to realize that.
 ...That is all... A foolish tale."
"Wh‐......who?!
 Who\'s there...?!"
"...Milady, be quiet.
 ......She is the witch, ...{f:5:Beatrice}...
 .........I am in her debt, ......because she let me be with you one more time."
"............The witch.........{f:5:Beatrice}......"
"...I am unimportant.
 I suggest you instead make haste in hiding that girl in the shadows of the curtains.
 .........You probably do not have much time left.
 You should spend it in a final conversation with Jessica."
"...A secret meeting inside a bundle of curtains... You two have quite the sense of style.
 *cackle*cackle*..."
"Uh, umm, ............thank you, {f:5:Beatrice}...!!
 Thank you for letting me be with Kanon‐kun......!!"
Jessica didn\'t know where Beato was, so she said that while facing in the wrong direction.
Perhaps because she found that funny, Beato snickered.
"I will now leave this room to the pair of lovers.
 Evil witches have no need for tales of love, you see.
 Allow me to retreat."
"......{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama...
 ...Thank you very much."
"Hmph...
 .........No need to thank me.
 You know well that something like this isn\'t enough to compensate for all of the evil I have done."
"I give my gratitude to good witches as a parting gift.
 ...I don\'t care about what happened before now, or what will happen in the future.
 ......All I know is that, in this very moment,
 ...you are without a doubt...a good witch."
"......You flatter me, furniture.
 The next time we meet, I may be an evil witch who will not betray your expectations.
 ......And with that, farewell."
Beato left the parlor and closed the door.
And mustering the last of her remaining magical power, she sealed the door.
The fact that those two had escaped into here would eventually be noticed.
...And now that the ninth twilight had been reached, no matter how much they struggled, their inescapable fate had already been decided.
However, until that final moment, they should be permitted the time to speak with each other of their love.
The witch poured out all of her magical power to protect their time together.
......So that no one would be able to defile their time alone together until the final moment.
Just then, ...Beato perceived something.
......Her body had been detected by a magical searching technique.
...The cruelhearted witch\'s furniture had sniffed this place out.
"............So, boorishness is the witch\'s way of doing things...
 To think that she doesn\'t even intend to allow the two young ones to speak to each other of their love...
 ......*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*...!!"
"45, data received.
 Comparing target, confirmed as the Predecessor Lady {f:5:Beatrice}.
 Analyzing parlor defensive wall.
 Multilayered defensive wall, 72 layers, attack barrier and magic reactive armor.
 Sniping into the parlor is impossible.
 Data link to 410."
"410, data received. Nihi!
 Then we\'ve just gotta{0}{nobreak:{m:-5:——}—}{0}the Predecessor first nyeh.
 Great Lady {f:5:Beatrice}, permission to fire, please!"
"Go ahead and shoot.
 ...Oh, and avoid her vital areas.
 There\'s something I want to ask that old hag."
"410, firing.
 Nihi!"
The Chiester Sisters\' gold bow released a golden snake.
......It crawled down the corridor starting from the front of the servant room, drawing a soft, serpentine curved trajectory as it made for the parlor,
 ...and struck through Beato\'s chest.
"..................guhahh......!!!"
Gold butterflies gathered, and the cruel witch showed herself there along with her furniture.
"......Predecessor‐sama.
 You will not get away with obstructing us a second time."
"......ugh......u......... I never thought I would...
 ......Still, the Chiester Sisters really have gotten rusty.
 To think that they failed to bring me down.
 ...And twice, at that...!"
Ronove spoke in a manner fitting for the witch\'s butler.
{n}As she pushed her pain aside, Beato grinned and spoke back.
"My, my apologies, Predecessor‐sama...!
 We were ordered to avoid vital areas...!"
"As soon as there\'s an order, we can pierce you at any time.
 Through your earring holes, your belly button hole, any hole you like.
 Nihi!"
The gold snake that had shot through Beato grew even longer, drawing a helix like a morning glory vine, and awaited its next order.
...It was ready to pierce a vital spot as soon as the merciless witch told it to.
".........For what reason would someone like you, who is even more brutal than me,
 make them avoid my vital areas?
 New {f:5:Beatrice}...!!"
"I wanted to ask you.
 ...I don\'t know what trick you used to escape, but we were under the impression we had taken you out, you know?"
"Why is it that even though you could have escaped by hiding, you took the risk of appearing again?
 ......It can\'t be that you came back just to protect those two young people, surely?"
"......Well, ...who knows?
 ......*cackle*cackle*...!"
"And just a second ago.
 Why\'d you do something as soft as reviving the lovers and reuniting them?
 ...The more I hear about you, the more I learn that I don\'t even reach up to your feet as an incarnation of evil."
"If you\'re like that, why did you suddenly start acting so mildly?
 ......That\'s what I wanted to ask."
".........*cackle*cackle*!
 Because I am brutal, I am fickle.
 How could there be any meaning in asking that?"
"Chiester Sisters. Sew her."
When she ordered that, the gold snake that was curled in a helix and suspended in space...
moved as fast as a real snake going after its prey,
 and pierced Beato\'s body multiple times from the front and the back, its golden tail drawing a {p:0:×} shape.
As the ruthless witch had ordered, it drew a cross‐stitch through Beato\'s chest.
The gold thread made a squeaking sound and tormented Beato...
Rather than a gold snake aiming for its prey,
 it waited for orders in midair as if it was a sewing needle ready to sew Beato.
"When it comes to you, there\'s no way it was a whim.
 ......I\'ve heard about you.
 And I\'ve learned.
 You are such an incarnation of evil that I don\'t even rise up to your feet.
 I thought I was truly a fitting successor to you."
"......But you\'ve always been in the way.
 You always say warm, pleasant things that shock me.
 ......What changed you?
 You explored the depths of evil for one thousand years,
 so I let you live just to find out...what happened to overturn that millennium?"
"......If you want to know, I suggest you too spend a thousand years finding out.
 *cackle*cackle*cackle*!"
"Sew her."
"Gwaahhhh!!!
 Ackkah, ......gahah!!"
Beato\'s chest was once again sewn with a golden cross‐stitch.
It tightened once again, squeezing fresh blood from Beato\'s chest.
The intense pain it caused ran in conflict with its beauty to the eye.
".........You might actually be another one of those types who disappear when they die and don\'t leave a corpse.
 So I\'ll kill you slowly."
"But if you answer my questions honestly, I\'ll kill you gently.
 I\'ll give you a splendid, gorgeous death perfect for my predecessor.
 I\'ll sink you in a coffin filled with water and roses.
 Isn\'t that wonderful?
 ...And you still won\'t talk?
 About the reason for your change of heart."
"*cackle*cackle*...!!
 Not answering what she is asked is also one of the pleasures of an evil witch."
"Sew her. Twice."
"Gyoah, gwuhaahh.........!!"
"Of course, you don\'t have to answer.
 After all, that way I get to torture you.
 Kuukuhihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihihi!!"
"The Endless Magic, the Infinite Magic, truly is wonderful.
 ...When you think about it, this world is finite in every way.
 The infinite cannot exist in the human world.
 Because God is infinite, he deprived the human world of all infinities so that he could look down upon it."
"...So, in other words, the power of the infinite is the power of God!
 A wonderful power where the more you play with it, the more fun ways of playing you find!
 You used that power as you pleased for one thousand years and went on a rampage!
 Why are you having a change of heart only now?
 Don\'t tell me you just {i:miss} it now that you handed it over to me?"
"How could I miss it.
 The Endless Magic is not magic as you believe it to be.
 ...True magic is in a deep abyss that you most certainly cannot reach."
"And you realized what that is......?
 What...is it?"
"*cackle*cackle*cackle*!
 Wander around for a thousand years without realizing that, you foolish witch."
"Sew her. Three times this time."
"Gwoah, gyuooh, ...guhh...!!!"
They continued embroidering Beato\'s chest with the gold thread.
{n}It tightened even more, causing Beato more and more pain...
"......Well, whatever.
 I\'m not the least bit interested anymore in what deep understanding some good‐as‐dead hag came to.
 I\'m bored now, so I\'ll kill you quickly.
 If I kill you, the barrier to the parlor will be undone."
"......Then I\'ll torture Kanon and Jessica to death a whole bunch of times.
 ......Being able to have two lovers as my toys at the same time, ......sounds fun, right?
 Kuhhi{0}hi{0}hhi{0}hhi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hhi{0}hi{0}hihihi!!
 Kill her...!!!"
Without missing by a millimeter, the gold sewing thread shot through Beato\'s heart...
{n}That intense pain was worse than all of the pain before that put together.
Beato finally remembered the actual feeling of dying, which she had forgotten over one thousand years...
But, .........she couldn\'t die.
 She must not die.
{n}If she died, the two in the parlor would be handed over to the brutal witch.
So she definitely couldn\'t die.
{n}She resolutely...refused to die...!
".........New {f:5:Beatrice}...
 ...I have a request.
 .........The lover\'s meeting between the two in the parlor is to be short.
 .........In the amount of time an hourglass can measure, Kanon will probably disappear to Hades.
 ...Would you please allow them that much time...?"
"No waay.
 Tearing apart two who love each other is fun, isn\'t it?
 You\'re the one who said it.
 So I want to try it!"
"......*cackle*cackle*...
 In that case, I cannot allow you to enjoy that pleasure...
 *cackle*cackle*, it is fun, tearing lovers apart."
"Right?
 I\'m sure it must be, right?
 So don\'t get in my way!!
 Sew her more!
 Sew, sew, sew!!"
"Nihi!
 410, understood!!"
The merciless gold sewing needle sewed its golden thread through Beato\'s heart over and over again.
......However, no matter how much it tightened, that heart did not stop...
"Khh......hhhhhhh...this isn\'t nearly enough...
 You\'ll have to do better than this to kill me...!!"
"What are you doing?
 Make this old hag stop talking.
 Kill her quickly!"
"W‐...we are...!!
 Even though we\'ve sewn her heart in place several times,
 ......her heart...w‐won\'t stop...!!"
"......Are you...immortal?"
"Of course not.
 ......I\'ve handed the endless over to you.
 There is a limit to how many more times my heart can beat."
"...However, if by making it beat just one time extra, I can give the two in this room even slightly longer to themselves,
 ......I\'ll continue that meager resistance for all eternity!!"
"Sew!!
 Keep sewing until her heart stops beating!!"
"Guuh, guooooh, gwaa{0}aA{0}A{0}Aaa{0}a{0}aAA{0}A{0}AAa{0}ahhhh!!"
"...Wh‐......why doesn\'t she die?!
 This is impossible...!!"
"Her heart is, ......sewn in place...
 ......So why...doesn\'t it stop?!"
"Fine then, we\'ll make the heart explode from the inside nyeh...!
 How pitiful, and you could have died cleanly if you hadn\'t resisted us!!"
The gold needle and thread made round trips over and over again as they spoke, and still Beato didn\'t expire...
The barbarous witch was at last starting to turn pale at how unnatural this was.
"............What in the world......are you...?"
"......*cackle*cackle*cackle*.
 ......You probably cannot understand.
 ......Even I didn\'t understand.
 ......But still.
 ...Somehow or another, it seems that this is true magic.
 .........In other words,
 ......I have now...
...become it.
 ...I have become...
...a true witch!!"
"Center of explosion stabilized in heart interior.
 Primed and ready!"
"Detonate!!!"
There was a deafening sound, .........and gold leaf and a flutter of gold butterflies were scattered around the area.
Beato\'s chest had...opened wide from the inside,
 ......and from that, gold butterflies and gold leaf erupted, staining the surrounding area gold...
Then, Beato\'s body crumpled.
Like a puppet whose strings had been cut, ...she crumpled and sank down to the floor.
......However, in the air, a gold heart tied by gold threads floated, and continued to beat...
".........Wh‐.........what the, .........hiiiiii..."
"M‐......monster......hiiiiiiiiii...!"
When the Chiester Sisters saw that, they fell on their behinds in shock.
......Somehow, ......even though Beato had become nothing more than a heart, it still kept beating,
 continuing to protect the barrier to the parlor.
...It was an immeasurably immense magical power.
...Impossible to measure.
 In other words, infinite—and endless.
".........I, {i:I\'m} the Endless Witch, right...?
 .........Why is this old hag......still alive......after all of this......?!!"
"Chiester Sisters!!
 Smash that heart!!
 Quickly!!"
"I‐it\'s impossible, my apologies!
 We cannot do it!!"
"............It is probably impossible.
 No number of people could crush that heart.
 ...Much less the likes of the soldiers who serve under His Highness the Dragon King."
"In that case,
 an Endless Witch like me should be able to crush it, right?
 My power is a god\'s power!!"
"I am afraid to say,
 that your power...
cannot leave a single scratch on {i:{f:7:Beatrice}‐sama\'s} endless nature."
"......Just what...do you mean by that......"
"In the same way that there is no light without knowledge of shadows,
 ......there is also no endless without knowledge of the limited.
 .........Before Milady {f:5:Beatrice}\'s true endless power, your flimsy magical power is very, very lacking."
"What is.........that supposed to mean......"
"...aah—"
The cruel witch stepped back in surprise.
It was more transparent than a lace curtain...
......but Beato\'s form—no, {i:{f:7:Beatrice}\'s} form—was still standing there.
Even after taking on this wretched appearance, ......she would not allow evil through that door.
At that time, ......a shadow just as faint as {f:5:Beatrice} stood behind her.
It was Kanon.
".........{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama.
 ...Thank you very much.
 ...I will not forget this favor you have done for me."
"......Hmph.
 ...I shall hear those words again when the number of my favors surpasses the number of grievances I have caused.
 ......Are you done?"
"Yes.
 .........Truly, thank you very much.
 ......And {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama,
 ......you have also...done enough.
 ......Please,
 ......be at peace..."
"......Is that so...
 ......So this...is enough......
 .........ku......*cackle*cackle*cackle*..."
"What\'s going on...?
 ......Why are you guys calling that predecessor hag {f:5:Beatrice}?!
 {f:5:Beatrice} is {i:my} name, right?!
 It should be my name, as the new Golden Witch and Endless Witch, right?!"
"............What gall.
 How dare you assume {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama\'s name."
"I am afraid to say...
...that the name of {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama should be taken by the person who can be crowned as the Endless Witch.
 By now, the term "predecessor" refers to you.
 ...Pukkukukukuku."
"What......did you say......?"
".........Farewell, Kanon.
 ......I\'ll meet you soon anyway.
 In a new nightmare."
".........In the nightmare of a new night, I will once again be your companion, {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama...
 ......With that, ...if you would excuse me......"
Kanon\'s form grew faint, ......and he disappeared into thin air.
After watching him go, ...{f:5:Beatrice}\'s form also grew faint, ......and before disappearing, it slumped over onto the floor.
Then, ......there was a splat.
The golden heart which had been floating in midair...had lost its sparkle, become blood‐stained flesh, and fallen to the ground.
...How frail it was.
{n}It was ragged and full of holes.
...But until just now, it had sparkled so much, and had continued to beat forcefully.
That heart still barely managed to beat.
......However, it was only a matter of time before it stopped.
{f:5:Beatrice}, whose form had become fragile and faint like incense smoke, lay on the floor,
 ......steadily watching her own heart...
There, the cruel witch could be seen...
"...H‐...how are {i:you} "{i:endless}"...?
 Face reality, you\'re collapsed in a heap on the floor, aren\'t you?!"
"Endlessness with limits...that\'s a contradiction, it can\'t possibly exist!
 This is the limit of your magic!
 The limited is inferior to the infinite!!"
"...................................."
{f:5:Beatrice} no longer had the energy even to respond.
{n}...No, in fact, it was doubtful whether the words of the cruel witch even reached her ears...
"If you\'re a real Endless Witch, try standing up!!
 Well?
 You can\'t, can you?!
 Why do you think you can\'t stand?!
 It\'s because you aren\'t an Endless Witch!!"
The merciless witch poked {f:5:Beatrice}\'s heart with her fingernail.
{f:5:Beatrice} had no words with which to respond to that provocation.
......However, ...instead of words, she returned a single expression.
{n}......It looked insulting only to the cruel witch.
Because she had gently curved her mouth, ......and smiled.
......Footsteps were approaching that place.
There was no way she could mistake them.
 ...That boisterous noise of shoes against the ground was the sound of Battler\'s footsteps...
".........Battler, is it.........
 .........ku, ......*cackle*cackle*cackle*...
 ...For all my talk, ...I\'ve ended up like this......"
"................................."
"............I\'ve been trying to become...
...the true witch you talked about,
 .........in my own way......"
"...Yeah.
 ......I was watching."
"......Hey,
 ......have I now...
......been able to...
...become a witch......?
 ......Have I earned the qualifications to become...
...your opponent......?"
"No good."
Battler said that unbelievably bluntly.
Taking a painful breath, {f:5:Beatrice} saw that, and sneered at herself as though she should have expected it.
"............ku, ...*cackle*...
 ...Is that so.
 ......It seems I still have an uphill struggle ahead of me on the road to becoming a true witch..."
"......However, ...I will not surrender...
 ......Just like you never surrendered to my torture...
 .........I will definitely......become a true witch,
 ......and be...accepted as......your opponent......"
"Yeah, it\'s no good.
 It\'s no goddamn good at all.
 You aren\'t my opponent."
The brutal witch raised her foot high...
{n}...Below it was {f:5:Beatrice}\'s frail heart.
"Die, you old hag!!
 See if you can show how endless you are after you\'ve been mushed to bits!!
 I am the witch!
 I am the Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}!!!
 Diiiiiii{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}iieee!!"
{e:170:"Yeeeeeahhhh, it\'s no good, it\'s no goddamn good at aaaa{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}aaall!!!"}
"Wha‐.........what...
...is this......?
 ...Wh‐.........where am I......?"
"Get in your seat.
 My opponent isn\'t Beato.
 .........It\'s you."
"......B‐...Battler...?!
 What kind of magic is this?!
 Who cares, it doesn\'t matter!!
 Chiester Sisters!!"
"45, understood, individual firing!!"
"410, understood, die Battler!!"
The Chiester Sisters each readied their own golden bows, and fired golden arrows.
The two only pulled the bowstring together when using precision guidance.
{n}If they were fighting against an enemy before their eyes, they fired their bows at the same time.
And the power was no different from what it normally was.
"Wha......... I‐i‐it was deflected?!?!
 There\'s no barrier, it was deflected with resistance alone...
 F‐...45, target measurement!!"
"45, understood...
 ............huh, ......whaaaa...?!
 Th‐this is... ...Am I broken?
 The measurement is...going berserk......?"
"A‐anti‐magic resistance, endless nine...
 E‐even mythical‐class magical attacks have no effect on the target!!"
The warheads of the golden bows could penetrate any magical armor with their mutual corrosion.
When attempting to block that using the anti‐magic resistance stat, even something with eight digits wouldn\'t escape penetration.
...Furthermore, even among the famous gods that appear in myths, there are not many who reach a resistance stat of nine digits.
For that reason, nine digits were enough to measure almost all imaginable values.
...Battler had filled all nine of those digits with 9\'s......
"......How foolish.
 When Battler‐sama is serious, mere magical arrows cannot even succeed in making his hair tremble."
The Chiester Sisters dropped their golden bows in shock...
...To this Battler, it felt even less perceptible than two dragonflies passing by his sides.
"............What the hell are you guys doing?
 Are you playing or something?"
"...Hiiiiiii...
 ...M‐......monster......"
"If your name\'s not Eva, get the hell out of here!!
 And you get in your seat, you goddamn fake witch!!
 I\'ll tear that mask of yours off!!!"
""H‐...hiiiiiiiiiiiii!!""
The Chiester Sisters couldn\'t hide their fear at Battler\'s ferocity, and they backed up as though they had been struck.
{f:5:Beatrice} watched this scene in shock......
"B‐......Battler,
 ......what......is this supposed to be......?"
"Just what you\'re seeing.
 My opponent isn\'t you."
"It\'s her!!
 The impostor over there, who\'s assuming your name!!!"
"Gh...!"
"......I\'m fighting against witches.
 ...And my method of denying them is to make anyone who calls themselves a witch my opponent, and crush them.
 ......I\'ve seen more than enough of your arrogance."
Then, Battler\'s eyes grew as sharp as blades as he fixed his eyes on the cruel witch.
"......Magic, my ass.
 Witches, my ass!
 You aren\'t a witch!!
 I\'ll rip that mask off and tear it to shreds!!
 {f:5:Virgilia}, get ready to fight!!"
"Understood.
 Preparations are complete, so go whenever you\'re ready.
 ......{f:5:Beatrice}.
 You stay back and rest."
"M‐mm......"
Beato looked at Battler timidly.
{n}...She still hadn\'t been acknowledged as his opponent.
{n}Was she qualified to watch the game board from the sidelines...?
"Beato, stay back and watch!!
 I\'ll tear it off!!
 I\'ll take this fake witch completely apart!!
 I won\'t let someone like this call themselves a witch!!
 You protected the honor of true witches!"
"Uh, ...I, umm......"
"You don\'t need to say anything."
"On your behalf, I\'ll teach her that the name of the Golden Witch definitely isn\'t that cheap!!"
".........B‐.........Battler..."
"Those are the general rules."
"............Thanks, Ronove.
 I get most of the rules now."
"...I see.
 You can\'t win with magic, so you came to face off with me in a world where victory is decided by something other than magic."
"......Foolish people.
 You really think you can win against me with twisted logic?!"
"Damn right I do.
 I\'ll crush all of your twisted logic, Aunt Eva!!"
"I, I am not Eva...!!
 That is the name of the old shell that I shed.
 I am a true witch, born inside of her...!!"
"Don\'t try to trick me! Your true form isn\'t a witch or anything like it, but a flesh‐and‐blood human.
 The human culprit, Ushiromiya Eva!!!
 {f:5:Virgilia}, reconstruct the second twilight!!"
"Understood."
"On the second twilight, Rosa and Maria were killed in the rose garden.
 We make our first move by applying the Eva culprit theory."
"Huuh?
 Riiidiculous!
 Come, arise, try to remember!
 What form did Ushiromiya Hideyoshi have?!!"
"Whaat?
 What\'s this supposed to be?"
"......It\'s summoning of the dead.
 It is easy for a witch to bring even the dead to the stand for testimony..."
An Uncle Hideyoshi who you could see right through was summoned.
...Magic sure is convenient.
{n}He looked as though he couldn\'t see what was going on here, almost like a person on the other side of the TV.
"Witness summons.
 Ushiromiya Hideyoshi\'s testimony.
 Come, Hideyoshi, speak...!"
"......I was takin\' care of Eva in the room the whole time.
 Eva didn\'t leave the room either, of course."
"Aunt Eva.
 Around here, testimony that isn\'t red isn\'t worth crap."
"I demand that he repeats it again in red!!"
"Oh yeah, that\'s right.
 Sure, say it in red for him!"
"
{p:1:I was in the room the whole time}.
 {p:1:Both before and after the time period of the crime}."
"See, look.
 This makes it impossible for Eva to be the culprit!
 How will you counter this?"
"Ridiculous.
 That move\'s so pathetic, I could yawn.
 ......Beato never used such childish tricks, not even once."
".........Battler..."
"Repetition requested!!
 "Aunt Eva was also in the room the entire time, before and after the time period of the crime"!!"
"Uncle Hideyoshi was just there to create an alibi.
 You made Uncle stay in the room and stealthily snuck out.
 ......If that isn\'t true, this guy should be able to say so in red!!!"
"D‐decline repetition...!
 Hideyoshi\'s testimony is sufficient!!
 There\'s no need to repeat that, right?!"
"......She\'s backed down.
 Mercy is unnecessary.
 This is check."
"Yeah, I\'ll take it. This opponent is a piece of cake!!"
"Check!!
 Maybe Uncle Hideyoshi didn\'t leave the room the whole time.
 But saying he was taking care of you the whole time...is a barefaced lie!"
"Therefore, no alibi exists for you!!
 You had a chance to slip out of the room and kill Auntie Rosa and Maria!
 If you think you can dodge that, try proclaiming in red that "Auntie Eva didn\'t take a step outside of the room"!!"
"You can\'t, right?
 Checkmate!!!"
"Wh‐.........what is that......?!
 I, ......I don\'t get it...!!"
"Sorry, Auntie.
 ......Even if you aren\'t used to the rules, beating your opponent down with all your strength is how this game is played.
 ......Isn\'t it, Beato?!"
"M‐...mm..."
"The witch side resigns.
 Let us continue on to the next game.
 Next is the fourth twilight through the sixth twilight."
It seemed that the witch still didn\'t understand how to approach things, and was losing her composure in irritation.
She was probably also angry that a shot had been taken at her while she still didn\'t get what was going on.
...But I won\'t go easy on her at all.
Just like she didn\'t go easy on the victims at all, I won\'t go the slightest bit easy on her...!!
"{f:5:Virgilia}, next crime!
 Let\'s reconstruct the incident with Dad and the rest!!"
"Understood."
"Rudolf, Kyrie, and Hideyoshi: these three people went to the mansion, and were killed there."
"My move won\'t change.
 Aunt Eva, {i:you} are the culprit!!"
"This time, you don\'t even have an alibi from Uncle Hideyoshi!!
 You claim that you were sleeping in that room all by yourself.
 But that is untrue!!!
 If you can proclaim it in red, just try it!!"
"......I refuse.
 ...So tell me then!
 Eva is just a woman.
 And the people who were killed were three adults holding two guns, right?"
"How did she kill them all by herself?
 How did she do it with those stakes as weapons?
 How is this stake‐shooting device that everyone keeps talking about constructed?!"
"Explain that!!
 As long as you can\'t explain it, even if Eva doesn\'t have an alibi,
 it doesn\'t mean that it was possible for Eva to commit murder!"
"Decline explanation!!
 It\'s a "Devil\'s Proof"!
 You can\'t refute the existence of an unknown murder technique or an unknown weapon just because it\'s impossible to explain!!"
"In short!!
 Even if I can\'t explain how the stake‐shooting device is constructed, that doesn\'t disprove its existence!!"
"Wh‐what is that?!!
 Is that madness allowed?!"
"......‘Devil\'s Proof’, valid."
"Agreed.
 "Devil\'s Proof", valid.
 ......Battler‐kun can claim that a stake‐shooting device exists without bearing the responsibility of explaining how it is constructed.
 The witch side cannot object to this move."
"......N‐not bad...
 How pushy..."
"Heh!
 Well, there\'s this ill‐natured witch who trained me well.
 This is check, got it?!
 Try saying in red that Auntie Eva didn\'t take a step out of that room!!"
"That\'s right, there\'s no way you\'ll be able to say it!
 If you can\'t say it, it\'s over, checkmate!!"
"......Th‐......that\'s so irrational.........!
 This is...messed up...!"
"Those are the rules of this game.
 ...How about some black tea first?
 We also have some delicious cookies, you know."
"I don\'t need all that!!
 Oh, that pisses me off...!
 So you fight like a coward just because you can\'t win with magic...!!"
"Don\'t get irritated.
 Drink some black tea or something.
 I\'ll take mine straight.
 What about you, Beato?"
"I, ...I am fine...
 .........More importantly, Battler, don\'t let your guard down.
 Your opponent is merely unfamiliar with the rules.
 ...It will start in earnest once your opponent gets the feel for it..."
"But I\'ll crush her.
 I\'ll thoroughly crush her.
 That\'s because she isn\'t a witch."
"If I accept her as a witch, ......all of your stubbornness counts for nothing!
 I don\'t care what kind of irrational argument or twisted logic I have to use,
 I\'ll crush her with all of my heart and soul!!"
Battler\'s side then stuck with the "Eva culprit theory" to explain Krauss and Natsuhi,
 the seventh and eighth twilights, in the exact same way.
At that time, there had been no one on the first floor of the guesthouse except for Eva and the victims.
 ...As before, no one could establish an alibi for Eva.
At the time, Eva had claimed that they had disappeared while she was in the lavatory,
 but nothing supported that, and the witch side couldn\'t repeat that in red either.
With the same argument as she had used to ask about the construction of the shooting machine,
 the witch side asked once more how Eva could have strangled both of them at the same time all by herself,
 but of course, Battler splendidly counterattacked by refusing to explain because of the "Devil\'s Proof".
Under the storm and stress of Battler\'s spirit, the witch side was completely swallowed up,
 and was forced to resign three times during the short period of time she had to grasp the rules...
".........Kuhhihihihihyahhyahhhya...
 Hah, I see!
 I\'m finally starting to get the knack of it.
 I won\'t let things go the way you want them to any more!"
"This time, let me take the initiative.
 Ronove, reconstruct the fourth through the sixth twilights!
 Pick out Ushiromiya Kyrie!
 ......For now, let me return to the murders of Rudolf, Kyrie and Hideyoshi for the fourth through sixth twilights."
"......Wh‐...what is she thinking?
 Why would she return once more to a board state she has already resigned from?"
"I see...
 ...This is a rare attack, which you do not use.
 Be careful."
"At the time, the survivors were barricaded in the guesthouse.
 They didn\'t have food, but out of concern for their safety, they were at least prepared to go without eating until the next day.
 ......However, in the end, three of them went out for food."
".........That\'s right.
 In the end, three people went outside to get food."
"I\'ll add in some red as I speak, \'cause it\'ll be a pain otherwise.
 {p:1:Kyrie didn\'t think that they needed food}.
 Since going without food for about a day wouldn\'t kill them,
 {p:1:she claimed that they should not leave the guesthouse}."
"And yet, she herself...
{p:1:suggested that they leave the guesthouse to get food}.
 .........Isn\'t this a contradiction?"
"Yes, a spectacular contradiction.
 It contradicts Kyrie\'s pattern of behavior."
"That contradiction...
{i:was created by me, using magic}!
 In other words, I controlled Kyrie using magic, and made her say that to lure the sacrifices outside!!"
"R‐ridiculous!
 There\'s no way that kind of magic exists!!"
"It\'s a "Devil\'s Proof", though!
 Just because you don\'t know about that magic doesn\'t disprove its existence!
 And I don\'t bear the responsibility of acting out that magic for you.
 And yet, you still have no room to counter this argument!!"
".........*giggle*giggle*!
 I wonder if it\'s alright to fight this way."
"Yes.
 It is truly a spectacular move.
 ......Battler‐sama, your response, if you please."
"You sure have brought in a weird argument.
 ...Run that by me again?"
"She has made a play against Ushiromiya Kyrie\'s pattern of behavior.
 ...As has already been explained,
 Kyrie\'s pattern of behavior had her saying that they should not go outside and head to the mansion in order to get food."
"Yet, even so, she took the initiative,
 and took the contradictory action of suggesting going to get food.
 As long as you cannot explain this contradiction, this violent move claims that it was due to magic."
"...Well, Kyrie‐san probably thought that too in the beginning."
"But she probably, uh, ...thought about various things midway,
 and had a change of heart, deciding that food really was necessary...
 It would be a problem if, due to hunger, we had no energy when we most needed it...and, well..."
"......She is claiming that this change of heart is due to magic.
 In short, ...while it might be extremely difficult, you must explain the reason for Kyrie\'s change of heart."
"Wh‐......what...?
 ...But that\'s asking me what was inside Kyrie‐san\'s own head..."
"Can\'t I also summon Kyrie‐san\'s ghost and question her or something?!
 Beato!
 Can\'t you call Kyrie‐san here or something?!"
"She cannot.
 That is a move permitted only to the witch side."
"S‐......sorry..."
"......Aaaaaaahhh, damn it!!
 She was probably, umm, ......thinking of us kids and, umm, ...on the whole, thought that food really was necessary and..."
"You must make that claim objectively.
 ...You require tangible evidence of the specific reason for which Kyrie changed her mind and decided that food really was necessary.
 ......For example, if someone heard her say that, or if it was written down somewhere."
"Too bad,
 {p:1:no reason for her changing her mind was ever told to anyone, nor was one ever written down}!
 Therefore, you can only speculate as to what was inside Kyrie\'s mind!"
"So it is impossible to prove!!
 You don\'t have a single counter to my move!
 It\'s your turn to resign now, Battler‐kuuun...!!"
"......It is possible to hypothesize endlessly as to the reason behind her change of heart.
 And, it is impossible to crush all of those endless possibilities."
"A detestably spectacular move.
 .........If Battler‐sama were to have a method of countering, ...it could probably only be that move."
"Wh‐......what move is that...?"
"......Well now.
 I wonder what kind of move it could be.
 I have the feeling that it was Milady\'s specialty, but I cannot remember."
"..................kh...
 Quit being stingy and tell me...!"
"{f:5:Beatrice}.
 There is no answer that will be given to those who stop thinking themselves.
 ...Think.
 Think in your own way!"
"Why don\'t you resign right now?
 And I\'ll corner you even more with red.
 {p:1:Until the last instant before she died, Kyrie maintained her pattern of behavior which states ‘I won\'t go to the mansion to get food’}!"
"And yet, she took the initiative and headed for the mansion.
 She was pushing a cart, trying to carry food.
 Why that contradiction?
 ......Because I controlled her with magic!!!
 This is the proof that my magic exists, and that I am a witch!!"
"...............Shut your damn mouth...!!"
"A‐...are you saying that she never even changed her mind?!
 ......The whole time until she died, Kyrie‐san thought "we don\'t need food", "I won\'t go to the mansion"?
 Then why did she step forward herself and say that they should go to get food, and go to the mansion...?!!"
"Are you saying that Kyrie‐san was being controlled with magic?!
 That\'s stupid...!!
 How, ...how am I meant to break through this magic?!"
"...If only Kyrie‐san were here, and just told us the reason behind her change of heart...
 No, I\'ve already been told in red that she never even changed her mind...!
 What should I do...?!!
 There\'s no move that the human side can counter with!!"
"The more I learn about this game, the more advantageous the rules seem for the witch, don\'t they?
 Even if the witch loses in a lot of areas, if she can win in just one, with that alone she can flaunt her existence."
"......In other words, Battler‐kun, you have no way of denying witches other than a complete victory!"
"You called me Eva all those times and seemed to be under the impression that you\'d been cornering me,
 but it\'s all been turned over by nothing more than the inside of your respected Kyrie‐san\'s head, don\'t you think that\'s truly funny?!"
"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*, ahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha!!
 Just do it, resign!!
 Why don\'t you just accept it forever?
 Why don\'t you just lose forever?!"
".........Damn iiiiiiiiiiiiiit...
 It\'s impossible for a human to show...
 I can\'t do anything but guess what the dead were thinking when they acted.
 Furthermore, I can\'t deny magic just by conjecture.
 ...To break through magic, I need objective evidence as to why Kyrie‐san had a change of heart..."
"......But damn it,
 it\'s been said in red that no evidence exists as to why she started wanting food...
 ......What should I do, damn it, damn it...!!!"
".........Battler‐sama.
 May I take it that...you resign?"
"...........................kh.........
 "I won\'t go to the mansion to get food".
 But how should I understand Kyrie‐san\'s thoughts, which actually do contradict......?!"
"You can\'t understand!!
 It\'s impossible to understand, and impossible to interpret!!
 That darkness is all of the witch!"
"Come on, it\'s useless to think, so quit, alright?!
 There\'s no way you can deny witches!
 I mean, look at me, {i:I exist}."
"I am the Golden Witch!!
 I stole that name from that former witch over there!!
 You can\'t deny that I am {f:5:Beatrice}!!!"
"Damn iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit...!!!
 You have no right to say that name...!
 ......And yet, ......I can\'t think of a move to deny that.........!!!"
Battler could no longer counter this witch who was laughing derisively in triumph...
He didn\'t want to give up, but he could do nothing.
He ground his teeth, making fists with both hands.
{n}......But even so, he couldn\'t think of a brilliant counterattack...!
"Battler‐sama.
 ......You are closing in on the time limit—will you resign......?"
"Kh......aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh......!!!"
".........The human side has no move in response.
 We will res—"
"Wait!
 ......Th‐there is......a counterattack."
"Wh‐......what did you say...?"
"Huh?!
 What kind of move can you possibly have, Predecessor‐sama?!
 Care to tell me what kind of move can deny my magic, the magic of {f:5:Beatrice}?
 You can\'t, it\'s impossible!!"
"......If the proposition "I won\'t go to the mansion to get food" cannot be explained by itself,
 ......I will explain it with the contrapositive.
 In short, you may also be able to explain it with "she did go to the mansion, therefore there was a goal other than food"."
"......R‐rather than my specialty "Hempel\'s Raven", ......this is Battler\'s specialty, "chessboard thinking"."
"......If it is impossible for Kyrie to have gone to the mansion with food as a goal,
 we can only explain it with another goal which caused Kyrie to go outside in any case.
 In other words, if we can establish that goal, we can defeat magic...!"
"I, I see...
 So she didn\'t go to the mansion with food as a goal, but had a different goal,
 and said that she wanted to go and get food in order to disguise her real goal..."
"......Y‐...yeah, if that\'s the case, it may still be possible to explain it.
 ......But......how?!"
"Master, reconstruct the scene where Kyrie died...!
 We cannot summon a ghost, but inspecting the corpse should be the human side\'s right..."
"Yes, that poses no problems.
 I will reconstruct the scene where Ushiromiya Kyrie died."
"We cannot call Kyrie\'s ghost here,
 but by learning what Kyrie left behind, we may be able to use that as a weapon."
"Ha, hahahahahahahahaha!!
 Fine, search as much as you want!!"
"There\'s no way you\'ll learn anything!
 I just said it in red a short while ago.
 {p:1:Kyrie did not leave anything written down}!
 No matter what you find, how could you understand anything!!"
".........We may find nothing...
 ......But, ......Battler is grinding his teeth, fighting to think of a move to break through you.
 .........This is all that I can do......"
Beato landed on her feet in the reconstructed hall,
 approached Kyrie\'s fallen body, and wandered around observing.
"I, I don\'t quite understand the process of how the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} side fights...
 .........Evidence was required, was it...?
 ......Then what should I search for?"
"The purported Great Lady {f:5:Beatrice} is getting down on her knees and crawling around!
 And she\'s even disgracefully searching a corpse?
 *cackle*cackle*cackle*, how that look suits you...!!"
"...Say what you wish...
 ......I cannot do any more than this...
 ......I do not care how I am mocked..."
".........However, I cannot abandon Battler, as he is fighting for my honor...
 ......Even if I must crawl on the ground and search through dead flesh,
 ......I must answer to that responsibility..."
While being subjected to the witch\'s sneers, Beato searched through Kyrie\'s corpse.
{n}......She fished through the pockets, taking out what was inside and laying it on the floor...
Laid on the floor,
 ......was a handkerchief,
 tissue,
 a key to her house,
 the stub of a plane ticket,
 a lighter,
 a cigarette butt,
 and a single hundred‐yen coin...
There was no special, suspicious object...
 Although Beato was down on all fours and being sneered at, that was all she could find.
"Ahhahahahahahahahahahahaha!!
 What\'s with that wretched looking trash?!
 Come on then, how are you gonna break through my magic with that stuff?!"
"Worthless, worthless, you look so duuuumb!!
 What\'s with this state of affairs after you butted in sounding all heroic?!
 Aaah, how pathetic, how embarrassing!!
 Why don\'t you just give up and die forever?!"
The witch fell over laughing, taunting Beato.
{n}...Beato hung her head, trying to withstand this shame.
"...Milady,
 are you satisfied with your inspection?"
".........M‐......mm...
 ...I......will not find any more than this..."
"From this evidence, can some move be made to counter?
 If not, then the human side must resign."
".....................khhh........."
"Obviously! You don\'t have any room to argue back!!
 I am a witch.
 You can\'t break through my magic!!"
"You\'re no longer anything but a former witch.
 Just a loser who isn\'t even allowed to take the name {f:5:Beatrice} anymore!!
 Go on, pile up as much trash and rubbish as you like, and try to break my magic with it!!"
"...You can\'t, right?
 You can\'t, can you?
 Kuhhihihihihi, and why\'s that?
 It\'s because I\'m a witch.
 ...It\'s because you\'re just a loser without a name!!
 Kuhhi{0}hhyah{0}hyah{0}hyah{0}hyah{0}hyah!!!"
".........Something, ............something should be here......
 .........I won\'t lose heart...
 ......I will not lose heart......
 No matter how much I am sneered at......Battler is fighting for my honor,
 ......so for the sake of his honor, ...I must not lose heart........."
As Beato held back tears at the words of humiliation she was being showered with,
 in the hope that Kyrie was holding something else, ......in the hope that she could find something that could save Battler from his plight,
 ......she searched earnestly.
...However, nothing more came up......
"...............Damn it all......
 ......Please, ......Ushiromiya Kyrie......
 I know you will save your son from his plight......
 .........Please, ......even after death, lend me power for his sake......"
However, Kyrie\'s body did not answer.
{n}......It was only natural that a corpse would remain silent.
No dead person existed that would answer Beato, now that she had lost the Endless Magic...
"It\'s pointless, pointless pointle~ssss.
 Toying with the dead is a privilege only for witches.
 For you, who is neither a witch nor even a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}, no one exists who will lend a hand!!"
"You will be alone for all eternity!!
 You have no witch or {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} allies, and no one will save you!!
 If that frustrates you, why don\'t you cry forever?!
 Why don\'t you apologize, say "I\'m sorry I\'m so useless" forever?!
 Ahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha!!"
"...............Sorry, ...Battler.........
 ...I......couldn\'t help you...in any way......"
"..............................
 ......No, you\'ve done enough.
 ......Thanks, Beato.
 I won\'t waste your efforts..."
"I, I don\'t need consoling...!
 Just how could you argue back with this pile of rubbish...?!!
 Just how could you strike back with this rubbish I endured her sneering to scrape together...?!"
In front of Beato, who was still crawling on all fours and hitting the pile of objects Kyrie had left behind with her fist, Battler also crouched.
And, ......after patting her on the shoulder in thanks,
 ......he moved that hand to the ground, picked up the cigarette butt, and held it up over his head.
".........What are you trying to say with that trash...?"
"Kyrie‐san doesn\'t smoke."
But Kyrie was even holding a lighter.
Certainly, she wasn\'t carrying a box of cigarettes itself,
 but at a glance, it very naturally looked as though Kyrie had a smoking habit...
"...Dad smoked, but Kyrie‐san didn\'t.
 ...But she did walk around with just a lighter to light Dad\'s cigarettes."
"Ha!
 So what?
 If the husband smoked, then even if the wife didn\'t, it isn\'t strange for her to have a cigarette on her."
"Maybe she just picked up her husband\'s irresponsibly tossed cigarette butt?
 What are you trying to say?
 What does this have to do with my magic?
 Nothing at all!!!"
"I\'ll say more.
 ...This is a different brand of cigarette than Dad smokes.
 ......Sorry, Beato,
 could you look in the pockets of Dad\'s body too?"
"..................M‐...mm.
 ......This...?"
"......Checking the brand.
 The brand is different from the cigarette butt.
 ...The cigarette butt Kyrie had on her is not of the same brand as the cigarettes that Rudolf smokes."
"And so what?
 Maybe Kyrie is just a good girl who likes things to be clean, so she couldn\'t leave a fallen cigarette butt alone and picked it up?
 I wouldn\'t though!!"
"......Beato, sorry, but one more time please.
 ...Uncle Hideyoshi\'s pockets.
 .........In this family, only Dad and Uncle Hideyoshi smoke cigarettes."
"I‐......it\'s here...!
 Is this it......?"
Beato found a cigarette box in Hideyoshi\'s pocket, took a single one out, and held it out.
"......Checking the brand.
 We acknowledge that the cigarette butt is of the same brand that Hideyoshi smokes."
"L‐like I said, so what?!!
 How can you break my magic because you found Hideyoshi\'s cigarette butt in Kyrie\'s pocket?!?!!!!"
"...............That\'s right.
 This cigarette butt is our message from Kyrie‐san.
 No, ......this cigarette butt itself is the reason that Kyrie‐san left the guesthouse."
"Beato, thank you.
 ......If you hadn\'t found this, I would have given up here."
"............{f:5:Virgilia}!!
 Reconstruct the situation!
 The guesthouse after it came to light that Auntie Rosa and Maria had been killed on the second twilight!!"
"Understood."
"Reconstructing.
 ......After Rosa and Maria\'s deaths, the remaining survivors rechecked all of the doors and windows in the mansion.
 They constructed a barricade.
 They rechecked that their defenses were solid."
"There\'s nothing suspicious about that at all.
 What are you trying to say?
 Why are you bringing back the second twilight when we\'re talking about the fourth twilight and after...?!"
"Dad carried a portable cigarette butt holder with him.
 I can finally see why Kyrie‐san deliberately put that cigarette butt in her own pocket."
"............It was because that cigarette butt meant something.
 That very cigarette butt was the message left by Kyrie‐san for us...!!"
"L‐let\'s hear it, then!!
 How, using a single cigarette butt,
 are you going to deny me?!!"
"......As you\'ve just heard,
 after the second twilight, an inspection was done for all the rooms in the guesthouse.
 .........At that time, Kyrie‐san found something that shouldn\'t exist, in a place where it shouldn\'t be."
"S‐......something that shouldn\'t exist...?
 ......What do you mean by that?"
"It\'s this.
 This cigarette butt.
 This had been set in the ashtray of the guest room where Uncle Hideyoshi had been."
"Huuuh?!?!
 What\'s wrong with there being a cigarette butt in an ashtray?!!
 Are you sure there isn\'t something wrong with your head?!"
"Aunt Eva hated smoking!!
 There\'s no way that there would be a cigarette butt there when she was sick and sleeping!!!"
"However, there was a cigarette butt in the ashtray.
 When she saw that, Kyrie‐san realized immediately.
 ......Uncle Hideyoshi was lying.
 She realized that Aunt Eva hadn\'t really been sleeping,
 ...and that she had snuck out of the room!!"
"Repetition requested!!
 "This cigarette butt was stubbed out in the ashtray of a room in which Uncle Hideyoshi {i:and} Aunt Eva were resting!""
".........I, ......I refuse...!"
"I\'ve finally got it.........
 Thank you, Beato."
"W‐
......was I...
...of some...
use...?"
"Yeah, you were!!
 We\'ll tear it off, we\'ll tear the mask off of the fake witch!!!"
From that cigarette butt, Kyrie realized that Hideyoshi was creating an alibi for Eva\'s sake.
Hideyoshi had been tasked with watching over the room to create an alibi,
 ...and during that time, he had been unable to withstand the tension and had smoked.
Then Kyrie had disclosed that to Rudolf.
{n}She disclosed that there was a good chance that Eva was the culprit, and Hideyoshi was an accomplice.
".........Next, Kyrie‐san proposed that they go to get food.
 And then she asked Uncle Hideyoshi to lend a hand!!
 This could only mean one thing."
"Kyrie‐san planned to isolate Uncle Hideyoshi and question him about the truth!!"
"‘Hempel\'s Raven’, valid.
 Unless the witch side can counterattack this move, the existence of the magic which claims to have controlled Kyrie is denied."
"Wh‐what did you saaaaaaaaaaaayy?!?!
 I, I deny it, anyway, I deny it...!!
 It wasn\'t me, no, wait,
 it wasn\'t Ushiromiya Eva, Eva was sleeping in the room!!!"
"Then try saying it.
 You can\'t and I know it!
 You can\'t say it this time either!!"
"Repetition requested!!
 "At that time, Ushiromiya Eva did not take a step outside the room"!!"
"What the hell is thiiiiiiiis?!
 {i:I\'m} the one who was attacking, right?!
 Why did I get on the side that\'s being attacked?!
 When did offense and defense get reversed?!"
"I\'m the one doing the questioning, you know?!
 The witch, me, whyyyyyyyyyy!!!"
"I repeat!!!!
 Repetition requested!!
 "Ushiromiya Eva did not leave the room"!!
 There\'s no way you can say it,
 it\'s CHECKMAA{-}A{-}A{-}A{-}A{-}A{-}A{-}A{-}A{-}A{-}A{-}A{-}A{-}AATE!!"
"Does the witch side have a move in response?"
"......There cannot be one.
 There is no truth that can be accepted from a false witch dressed up with truths and falsehoods."
"You aren\'t qualified to call yourself a real witch!!
 You aren\'t the Golden Witch!
 You are a human!"
"You are Ushiromiya Evaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!"
"OOOAAAOOOOOOOOOooooOOOOOOoooooohhhhhhhh!!"
The witch roared.
 Her entire body was burned with a tremendous heat that denied her own witchcraft and existence, and she let out a roar like a dragon...
Her body flickered repeatedly,
 flashing as Eva\'s figure and the witch\'s figure overlapped.
However, the roar drowned out that flicker, ...and made it return once more to the original form of the cruelhearted witch.
"......*cackle*cackle*cackle*, ...kuhhihha{0}hha{0}ha{0}hahaha...
 ...Alright.
 ...If you want to call me Ushiromiya Eva, then go right ahead..."
"......I admit it, I really can\'t repulse all moves related to Ushiromiya Eva being the culprit.
 ......I may have been dragged down from the position of Golden Witch,
 ...and maybe I am now being called Ushiromiya Eva..."
"......But you know what? That by itself doesn\'t mean that witches and magic are denied!!
 ...I\'ll teach you now..."
"I\'ll teach you that I am not Ushiromiya Eva, nor a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human},
 ......but a real witch...!!!
 Look and see this red truth!!"
The witch clapped her hands, and time advanced in the world of the game board.
As they called Jessica\'s name, Battler and Eva ran up to the parlor.
...They were searching for Jessica because they had gone to the servant room, found Nanjo\'s corpse, and didn\'t know where Jessica was.
".........So what\'s your point?
 ......What are you trying to say?"
"Y‐.........you couldn\'t be...
 ......Oh no......"
Beato went pale.
 ...That made it clear that the move the evil witch was about to make was bad enough to have such an effect on Beato...
"This time,
 ......I\'ll give you a fatal move that you won\'t be able to talk yourself out of.
 ...No, I\'ll make this move against all {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s who support you.
 Prepare yourself and listen...to my move."
"D‐......don\'t... That move is.........!"
"Beato, stay back...!!
 I\'ll take it!
 Bring it on, you fake witch!!"
"
{p:1:After Jessica was injured,}
 {p:1:Eva was constantly under Battler\'s supervision}.
 {p:1:Battler is neither the culprit nor an accomplice}.
 {p:1:By this, we can establish a perfect alibi for Eva}."
"Wh‐......whaat...............?"
"I\'ll seal you,
 and {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s as well,
 ......in a red barrier of death that most certainly cannot be escaped from.
 Farewell, lowly {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s.
 Sleep for all eternity in an absolute locked room of magic with no exits.
 ......Now, prepare yourself.
 For the red truth."
{p:1:There are no more than 18 humans on this island}.
Throw away your foolish thoughts of mysterious people hiding and committing crimes.
...But if I say it this way, you could also suspect animal culprits.
 It would be unbearable to hear an irrational theory about how an orangutan trained to commit murder wouldn\'t count as a human.
So, I\'ll change it like this.
{p:1:No life forms other than humans have any connection to this game}.
So, with that covered,
 next, I\'ll explain the situation for all 18 people who exist on this island.
{p:1:Kinzo is dead}.
 {p:1:Krauss is dead}.
{p:1:Natsuhi is dead}.
 {p:1:Hideyoshi is dead}.
{p:1:George is dead}.
 {p:1:Rudolf is dead}.
{p:1:Kyrie is dead}.
 {p:1:Rosa is dead}.
{p:1:Maria is dead}.
 {p:1:Genji is dead}.
{p:1:Shannon is dead}.
 {p:1:Kanon is dead}.
{p:1:Gohda is dead}.
 {p:1:Kumasawa is dead}.
{p:1:Nanjo is dead}.
Those 15 are all dead.
And.
{p:1:Battler is alive}.
{p:1:Eva is alive}.
{p:1:Jessica is alive}.
That\'s everyone, all 18 of them!
"So you understand that, accordingly, when the last victim, Nanjo, died,
 only three people, Battler, Eva, and Jessica, were alive, right?"
".........Wh‐......what did you say...?
 ......Y‐......you bitch, ...you couldn\'t mean............"
"
{p:1:Eva was with you the whole time}.
 {p:1:So committing a crime was impossible for her}.
 {p:1:Of course, Battler‐kun isn\'t the culprit}.
 {p:1:He wasn\'t forging an alibi for her, and he took the possibility that she was the culprit into account, watching over her actions carefully}."
"
{p:1:No chance existed for her to do anything suspicious}!
 {p:1:In short, at the time of the crime, only Nanjo and Jessica were in the servant room}."
"......And I know what you\'re thinking.
 Your next move will be this, right?
 There\'s also a chance that Jessica is the culprit!
 But too bad, I\'ll slice it up in red before you try!!"
"
{p:1:Ushiromiya Jessica has not committed murder}!
 {p:1:She was not involved with Nanjo\'s murder}!!
 {p:1:Her eyes were completely blocked}.
 {p:1:It\'s impossible for her to carry out a murder like that}!"
"And here\'s an extra.
 {p:1:Neither Eva nor Battler killed Nanjo, nor were they involved}!!"
"W‐wait a fucking second!!
 That makes no goddamn sense!!
 There are only three humans, then a murder occurs, ......and none of those three were involved? That\'s insane!!"
"I\'ll state it clearly.
 {p:1:The culprit who killed Nanjo was neither Battler nor Eva nor Jessica}!!
 In other words, it wasn\'t one of the survivors.
 Get iiit?"
"No, umm, .........th‐that\'s right!
 What about multiple personalities...?!
 Just like you were originally another personality of Auntie Eva\'s,
 ......let\'s say Jessica had another, witch‐like personality,
 which took the name of "someone other than Jessica" and killed Doctor Nanjo...!!"
"Moron.
 I\'ve already said it in red.
 {p:1:Jessica\'s eyes were completely blocked, and murder was impossible for her}!"
"No matter what kind of personality she was possessed by, murder could not be carried out with her body!
 I wonder if you\'ll be satisfied if I say it this way?"
"{p:1:No actions caused by Jessica\'s body had any relation to or influence on the murder of Nanjo}!
 {p:1:This also applies to Battler and Eva}.
 In other words, no matter how much you try to struggle and interpret it,
 {p:1:neither Jessica nor Battler nor Eva is the culprit who killed Nanjo}!"
"Y‐...you\'ve got to be kidding me!!!
 I mean, everyone else is dead for sure, right?!!"
"Then......all that\'s left......is the Doctor Nanjo suicide theory, right?!
 And the trap theory!
 The culprit was already dead, but a trap that they had already prepared went off..."
"{p:1:Nanjo\'s death was a homicide}.
 ...{p:1:Of course, it was with a direct method of murder, not a trap}.
 {p:1:They readied their weapon, and killed him with it directly from the front at point‐blank range}!
 {p:1:The culprit appeared openly before Nanjo\'s eyes, and as they both looked at each other\'s faces, the culprit killed him}...!!"
"But wait!!
 There are only three survivors!
 You said in red that everyone else is dead!
 You basically confirmed the life or death status of all 18 people.
 Furthermore, the existence of a 19th person has already been denied in red...!!"
"In other words, no one can exist except the three survivors!!
 And yet, a fourth person other than those three appeared before Doctor Nanjo!!
 How can a person other than us appear and murder Doctor Nanjo when no 19th person exists?!?!"
"Insane!!
 You\'re lying!!
 You\'re lying with the red letters!!!"
"{p:1:The red only tells the truth}!!!
 Isn\'t doubting that the same as betraying the honor of that witch who\'s behind you, shriveling up in fear of me and hiding behind your back?!"
"D‐.........damn it............!!!"
"I\'ll state it clearly,
 right now.
 ......The one who appeared in front of Nanjo was me.
 A witch.
 ......The Golden Witch, who can\'t be explained by the 18 humans!!"
"{f:5:V‐Virgilia}!
 Ronove...!!
 Isn\'t the situation contradicting itself?!
 Is she really telling the truth with red?!"
"......Yes.
 "Red truth", valid."
"............What an......elaborate and precise cornering......"
"H‐......how should I make a move against this...?
 {f:5:Virgilia}...!
 Isn\'t there any move......?!"
"..................I...cannot think of anything..."
"...And you, Ronove?!"
"........................
 .........My apologies.
 ......However, in these last thousand years,
 ...I have never seen......such an elaborately beautiful game board layout."
"............Although it pains me to admit it,
 ............it is beautiful.........
 ......What a...
...beautiful red...
...checkmate..............."
The witch\'s master and the demon butler were both stunned, ...and a somehow rapturous expression rose to their faces...
.........Forget surrendering,
 ...they were simply impressed at this perfect checkmate,
 ...which could only be admired...
When people accept defeat from the bottom of their heart...
{n}it gives rise to neither regret nor humiliation.
{n}......Nothing is born except feelings of respect...
I.........no longer knew......what was what anymore.
There were absolutely no weak points in her red.
She had said in red that all 15 people had died.
{n}She had said in red that no people existed other than the 18.
In other words, no more than three people—me, Jessica, and Auntie Eva—existed.
And even though none of those three people were the culprit, Doctor Nanjo was killed.
And without a doubt, Doctor Nanjo\'s death was a homicide, murdered by "that person" openly from the front...!
And she claims "that person"......is a witch.........?!!
"The culprit that killed Nanjo was not an animal or anything of the sort.
 That has already been dealt with in red, you know?
 Remove everything other than humans from consideration entirely.
 And no stuff like robots, either."
"{p:1:Absolutely no factors other than humans participate in this game board}!
 Therefore, I can also say this:"
"{p:1:The one who killed Nanjo was definitely a human}!"
"{p:1:A human, with their feet on the ground, held up a weapon and killed with it}!
 {p:1:Right before his eyes}!
 However, the human may have been able to use magic.
 ......Which means, it was a witch."
"......That is, in other words, me.
 The Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}!!"
......Even as Battler...
ground his teeth...
......his knees hit the floor with a thunk.
His soul still refused to submit...
......However, ...his knees had already...
...started to accept submission......
"Kuhhihhihihihihihihihihi!
 Oh, did you kneel...?"
"That\'s right, you\'re already starting to understand.
 ......The Golden Witch does exist.
 .........And that Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}, is me...!!"
"Come on, praise me.
 Now is the time to praise the resurrection of a true witch.
 Now is the time to praise the resurrection of the Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}!!
 On the ninth twilight, the witch revives, and none shall be left alive......!!!"
"Daaamn iiiiiiiitt.........
 ......I don\'t......understand......!
 After...being so thoroughly immobilized by the red,
 ......I don\'t......have a clue anymore......!"
"B‐......Battler......
 D‐don\'t lose heart......
 ...You and I...promised that we would fight each other again, did we not......?
 Will you surrender here...?!
 Will you disappear in a place like this before fighting with me again......?!"
"I don\'t want to break that promise......
 ............But......I can\'t think of any move to deny her...!!"
"In the first place, ...this isn\'t even a proper problem!
 Nothing exists outside the suspects, and all of the suspects are innocent!
 I\'ve been told that they\'re innocent in red!
 And also that it was a real homicide, and that the culprit was human, and that they did appear in front of Doctor Nanjo\'s eyes and kill him!
 I give up... There\'s nothing I can do...!!!"
"Please, Battler, don\'t give up, don\'t lose heart......!
 ......If you stop thinking, it automatically becomes your loss.
 ...I\'m begging you, don\'t lose heart...
 ......I\'m also cheering you on, ......so don\'t lose......!"
"I can\'t think of anything anymore...!!
 I end up thinking that she\'s just a witch anyway, and must have done it with magic, so just thinking is pointless...!"
"It\'s no good, my head hurts, my brain\'s tired...
 I end up thinking that thinking\'s pointless, so I should just stop...!!"
"Battler, listen...
 .........In the game of chess, both sides do all they can to make the other lose, so a single game takes a long period of time.
 ......However, if one side throws away victory from the beginning, and voluntarily makes moves harmful to themselves, the game will end in the blink of an eye.
 ......That is called a fool\'s mate."
A fool\'s mate is, simply put, a strange way of playing chess, with the mind to lose as soon as possible.
...Opening the area in front of your own king and inviting the opponent\'s queen in.
Chess, in which the average playing time for a single game may stretch for several hours, can be resolved in a scant four moves.
......In other words, if both sides try to win in a fight, they are compelled to take a painfully long period of time,
 ...but if one side decides to lose, they can end the game all too easily, at any time...
"......When the human side stops thinking, it hands the problem before its eyes over to the witch,
 and even an apple falling from a tree can be immediately resolved as the work of magic."
".........And it is the same way for the witch side.
 ...Witches use the red truth.
 ......If they use that to show that the true form of magic can be explained away using humans, they can immediately lose."
"............You don\'t have to tell me that...
 ......You\'re telling me not to stop thinking, right...?
 But,
 .........how am I meant to counterattack her perfect bright‐red move...?
 For me,
 ......for humans,
 .........it\'s no longer possible............"
".........Is it...
......impossible...?
 ......Is it...
...impossible for you, Battler......?
 ......Please... Don\'t lose heart........."
"..................Sorry.........
 ...It\'s no longer...
......possible for me........."
Battler scratched at the floor, crying heavily.
......Beato watched that with a distressed face...
Then she stood up, and spoke to the witch.
"............I will make a move as a counterattack to yours."
"Huh?
 How can you possibly cut up this perfect checkmate?"
"How can this checkmate, which is completely impossible for {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s to break,
 possibly be broken by the likes of you?!"
".........{f:5:B‐Beatrice}, you couldn\'t be..."
"Mm.
 ...What about a move that a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} cannot make.
 ......I will counterattack you with a move I can use because I am a witch..."
"A move you can use because you are a witch......?
 ......Wh‐...what are you planning to do...?"
"I will use the red...
to deny witches."
"{f:5:Beatrice}...!!"
"M‐Milady...!!"
The master and the butler were both startled.
......I also immediately understood what it meant.
{n}To use the red that only witches could use.
{n}...{i:To use the red to deny witches}.
It was like using her own sword to slit her own throat.
"Wh‐............whaaat...?!
 C‐......come on, what are you saying?
 Deny witches with red...?
 .........D‐...don\'t talk like an idiot.
 If you do that, ...you won\'t get away unscathed either......!!"
".........You are not a witch.
 And I am not a witch either.
 ...The road to becoming a true witch is difficult, and I have much, much farther to go..."
".........Then that is convenient.
 In this place now, witches did not exist from the beginning.
 I will strip this deception away myself."
"You and I both are real, obvious witches!!
 Being able to use red is itself proof that we are!"
"I don\'t know what the definition of a witch is to you,
 but if you\'re mistakenly thinking that you alone will be able to get away unscathed, then you\'d better—"
"I am making no such mistake.
 I would accept it."
"Wh.........at did you say......?"
"I never managed to become a witch in the first place.
 ......I have done nothing more than finally begin walking on the road to becoming a true witch."
"...If it is true that I am a witch as I stand,
 ...then I am nothing more than a false witch who got addicted to power, like you."
"......Rather than existing in that shabby form,
 I would have no regrets...
in erasing this form of mine along with you...!"
"A‐...are you insane?!?!
 S‐stop it...!
 I still want to be a witch! I don\'t wanna be {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}...!!"
".........Witch, please return to your seat.
 Please, receive the human side\'s response from your seat."
"Wh‐what are you doing?!
 L‐let go of me!!
 Don\'t let that woman use red!!
 Make her stop!!
 Let gooooooooooooooooooo!!"
As the witch stood from her seat and tried to spring upon Beato, Ronove pressed down on both of her shoulders, forcing her back into her seat.
And, even after that, he didn\'t remove his hands from those shoulders.
Denying witches was the same thing as denying magic.
......That included demons such as Ronove.
However, instead of running away, Ronove chose to act as the facilitator for the game,
 ...and to carry out that duty for his master\'s sake.
"......{f:5:Beatrice}.
 .........You have...no regrets, I hope."
"The same to you."
"......Sorry.
 ......Even though you taught me a lot of fun magic and happy spells,
 .........I couldn\'t use it well at all.
 ............So I\'ll train from zero,
 ...and start over again.
 ...I am truly sorry.........that you had to get caught up in your stupid disciple\'s misconduct."
"......I had a good disciple in the very end.
 ......Go, and do as you believe."
".........I, I don\'t have a clue what you guys are talking about..."
"...But I do understand one thing.
 And I can say this...
 ......Beato, I don\'t know what you\'re trying to do,
 ...but whatever it is you\'re about to do, don\'t do it...!"
"You have no moves.
 But I have one."
"......If we let this move escape us, she will be revived as a witch in the true sense, and this time, she will control this whole island.
 ...All nightmares will be hers to do with as she pleases,
 and this island will fall into the deepest hell of the evil witch\'s constant fantasies, for all eternity."
".........Can you permit that?
 ...Is it alright for your dear relatives to be toyed with for all eternity in that witch\'s nightmare?"
"S‐still, ......{i:you} shouldn\'t have to sacrifice yourself...
 Th‐this is a game between me and her.
 There\'s no need for you to sacrifice yourself to make a move!
 I, I\'ll think of something!
 I\'ll definitely think of a miracle move...!!"
"So don\'t rush into it!!
 Ooooooooooooooohhhh, damn it to hellllllllllll,
 I\'ll definitely think of one, ......so don\'t rush into iiiiiiiiiiit!!"
".........This game is cruel.
 The time limit for your deliberation has already run out.
 .........I am now the only one who can do it."
"...Worry not, Battler.
 .........I\'ll defeat her.
 ......I\'ll defeat that cruelhearted witch with my own hands..."
"W‐wait, Beato!!
 Stop it, quit it!!
 There\'s absolutely no need for you to sacrifice yourself!!"
"Last I remember, you were fighting to deny me.
 ......What a strange person.
 Hahaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha."
"......Let that child do as she likes.
 And please, see her through."
"B‐...but......"
"Battler.
 ......There\'s only one thing I ask.
 ......Would you...cover your ears?"
"My ears......?
 Why...?"
".........In a few moments, I will deny witches in red.
 I will slice up the game board that she has laid out with her red."
"......By doing that,
 .........I will probably lose my form as a witch as well.
 ......If you also hear the red truth I will tell, you will understand my true form."
".........Even if you alone cover your ears, the truth will not change at all.
 ......However,
 ...even so, I want you alone to cover your ears.
 ..................I at least want to be a witch...in your eyes.
 ......Please."
"......{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama.
 ...There is no problem on the witch side.
 Please, your move."
"Let gooooooooooooooooooo!!
 You won\'t get away unharmed either, you know?!"
"She\'s insane!!
 She plans on dying and taking us with her!
 Stop it, don\'t deny it!!"
"Stooooooppppppppppppp!!!"
"...How unsightly for a Golden Witch.
 .........Now, are you ready?"
"...I will remove your checkmate in Battler\'s stead.
 What happened on the chessboard where fifteen died, and only three remained?
 ...I will now expose it in red.
 With that red truth, ......I will impale and kill both fake witches!"
Beato turned around and smiled at Battler.
......Most likely, no one would believe that the witch who had gone to the limits of cruelty...
would try to leave a smile as the last expression she showed Battler.
And that smile signified her last wish, that she wanted him to cover his ears...
Denying witches in red......was the same as knowing her shabby form.
Battler put both of his hands against his ears...
......To protect her final...
honor as a witch, he put his hands against his ears, ...rejecting the truth.
And he howled.
 So that not even a bit of what she was saying would slip into his ears.
After that...was a world where Battler could not hear anything.
{n}Beato was saying something with red.
Even the evil witch attempted to cover her ears at their bitter contents.
......That was...the red truth.
 Words of power.
{n}......Words that denied her own existence.
Words that only witches could use—the only words capable of denying witches.
Beato talked.
{n}With the red truth, she sliced apart the bright‐red game board that the witch had released.
She explained difficult problems that could not be solved by humans, with moves that could only be solved by witches, and began cornering the witch.
The {i:truth} that Battler was not permitted to hear.
If Battler had broken his promise, and sneakily listened in...
{n}......in an instant, Battler would probably have been able to become the victor in his game with Beato.
......He would probably have understood all the riddles on the island, all of the magic and tricks, locked rooms, spells, curses, legends,
 ...and the entire tale of anger and sadness.
However, ......Battler would only learn what that was when he reached the truth by himself.
Yes.
 ...From the beginning, ......{f:5:Beatrice} had wished that Battler would reach that truth by himself.
It was something that shouldn\'t be reached by being told.
{n}It was a truth that Battler would have to drag himself to with his own power.
A brilliant light gathered with Beato and the evil witch at the center, and grew gradually stronger...
It was...the power of truth.
.........A heat and brilliance like the sun...
shone on all of the falsehoods that hid in the darkness, trying to deceive, ...and burnt them to nothing.
"GWOOOOOOOOOOAAAAAaaaAAaaAAAaaaahhhh!!
 How?!
 How can you die?!
 How can you throw away your life...when you have such incredible power?!
 You hold the power to control gold, magic, and everything else at will—
how can you so readily throw that away?!"
"......Learn that even with a mountain of gold,
 even with magic to split the sea,
 there are some things you can never obtain.
 .........Come, show yourself.
 Show your true form, ......Ushiromiya Eva!!!"
When the sun exploded and blew everything away...
{n}......Eva could be seen there, holding a gun.
"Y‐.........you are the culprit...
 Aunt Eva......!!!"
"*cackle*cackle*cackle*......ahhaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha!!
 Took you long enough to notice, Battler‐{i:kun}!!"
Without any hesitation or mercy, Eva raised the gun and pulled the trigger.
...An explosion resounded, and Battler fell to the floor, his heart shot through.
After going into convulsions for a short time,
 ...with blood dripping from his mouth,
 ...Battler died...
But in his last moments, ...he understood without a doubt that she was a murderer.
 And not just for killing him...
.........There are several murders where I don\'t have a clue how they were carried out.
However, ......while my ears were covered,
 ......Beato exposed all of them with the red, blasting away all magic.
...In other words, .........even though I didn\'t understand it,
 ......hadn\'t that been nothing more or less than proof that all magic can be explained with humans?
.........Beato made me cover my ears.
{n}...So I myself don\'t know the whole truth.
...However, .........from the fact that she managed to deny it in red,
 I learned one fact which is extremely unfair for us......namely, "it is possible to deny all magic".
So, in other words, .....................
......No,
 ......I must not think of that.
.........If I do, ...then the time I covered my ears would be made pointless.
If I\'m going to regret, I can only regret my own actions.
 ...If, at that time, I had thought of some turnabout move to counter the witch\'s final play,
 there would have been no need for Beato to sacrifice herself.
I......brought about this conclusion......because I was worthless...
