"You idiot!!
 Isn\'t it obvious?!!
 {i:It\'ll be fun to kill her and see the pained look on your face, why else}?!!
 Kuhyahahahahahahaha!!"
"Look, look, don\'t turn your eyes away, look at it.
 Look look, look look!
 It\'s magic, it\'s furniture, no matter how much you try to deny me and magic, look look, look look look look!
 Gyahhahhahahaha!!"
"......Sorry, Battleer.
 It was pretty interesting.
 ...Still, I was just trying to do what Master told me, but it really did work very well!
 I hear, after acting {ruby:tsuntsun:bad‐tempered} and exploring the depths of cruelty, if you act properly incompetent and {ruby:dere:soft}, you can get a massive rise on that goodwill meter thing, riiight?
 Kyahahahahahaah!!"
That lonely tone was the sound of the desolate wind blowing by.
The color of the glittering flower petals on the rose bushes was...that of gold.
The group of gold butterflies which had once danced through this golden rose garden like fluttering rose petals...
could no longer be seen anywhere...
The master of the Golden Land is the Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}.
She could be called inhumane and cruel.
 Arrogant and outrageous.
 And also, naive and simple.
That laugh of hers, which lost its grace more and more the longer it continued, ......could no longer be heard.
The Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice}...
sat like a doll, resting in a deck chair adorned as beautifully as the golden rose garden.
......She wasn\'t relaxing there.
Empty‐eyed,
 never responding to any questions,
 and yet still not permitted to sleep,
 {f:5:Beatrice} was sitting there as if she was a doll......
Her hair was down, and {f:5:Virgilia} was carefully fixing it up with a comb.
If {f:5:Beatrice} had been complaining about this and that regarding her hairstyle,
 then it would have been clear that she was the usual Beato.
......However, she gave no responses, and showed no reactions.
So instead, it only looked like {f:5:Virgilia} was combing the golden hair of a large doll...
Alongside them, there was a table.
On it was a chessboard...along with a mix of black and white pieces in an all‐out battle.
However, something about this setup looked different from normal chess.
...It might have been a game similar to chess but not identical.
And on the other side, ......sitting back in his chair as he contemplated his next move, was a young man.
...No, perhaps he wasn\'t thinking of his next move.
Every once in a while, he would change the positions of the pieces, reconsidering the situation each time he changed it.
Maybe he was reconstructing previous games, trying to discover the thought process behind those moves.
In the past...
Kinzo, the Ushiromiya family head, once likened studying chess games to taking a journey through the thoughts of the old masters.
Ushiromiya Battler...was on a journey.
A journey in search of the Golden Witch\'s thought process...which had led her to create these arrangements and make these moves.
Battler took a black piece which he had only just moved forward...and returned it to its original place, sighing deeply.
Battler\'s pieces were white.
 However, on that chessboard, the side facing Battler was Black\'s territory.
 He was stepping through the game from Beato\'s perspective...
"......The more I do this, the less I understand your moves."
Even Battler...didn\'t expect that Beato would respond to that statement.
No, ......he was still holding onto the hope that there might be a chance of her responding,
 and had only made it sound as though he was talking to himself.
Beato\'s eyes......reflected nothing.
And her mouth told nothing.
"........................"
After begging him to kill her,
 ...the Golden Witch had become a corpse which had given up on living.
She wasn\'t sleeping.
......She was forbidden to step down from this game, and therefore, sleep was not permitted.
So she must have heard.
However, ......his words probably hadn\'t reached her heart.
The Golden Witch would no longer sneer at Battler\'s moves, nor would she praise them or belittle them.
{f:5:Beatrice} was no longer......anything more than a living doll.
Even so, she would glance at him every once in a while. It would be an empty glance, but a glance nonetheless.
Sometimes, she would seem to make some sort of gesture or even move her lips.
However, her movements were never able to communicate anything to Battler......
"What led you to make this move in this situation?
 ......I don\'t get it at all.
 I don\'t understand your moves."
"....................."
"......Beato.
 Battler‐kun is talking to you..."
"....................."
"...Say something.
 Snicker or guffaw if you want.
 ......I don\'t even care if you use that shrill laugh of yours."
......It seemed unbelievable.
 That shrill laugh of Beato\'s...would never be heard again.
However, even if she couldn\'t answer, his voice was surely reaching her.
......Battler was talking to her because he believed this.
So he said the same thing one more time...
"What led you to make this move in this situation?
 I don\'t get it at all.
 I don\'t understand your moves."
"............
 ......So, her thoughts don\'t make any sense to you?"
{f:5:Virgilia} answered in her disciple\'s stead.
Up to this point, she had done her best to avoid speaking for Beato.
After all, there was a chance that Beato would respond in some way, and {f:5:Virgilia} didn\'t want to be the one to take that opportunity away from her.
......Which meant that Battler was being forced to bear with this silence...
...until Beato herself answered.
{f:5:Virgilia} could no longer bear to watch him like this...
And Battler, too, wanted to have a conversation with {f:5:Virgilia},
 with faith that their words would reach Beato\'s heart......
"Yep.
 I don\'t have a clue.
 ......The more I try standing in Beato\'s shoes and moving the pieces like this, the less I understand."
The successful execution of a serial murder following an epitaph.
 He was stepping through the games from the witch side with that as the victory condition,
 ......but he just couldn\'t make it fit with Beato\'s moves.
He could see several incomprehensible moves in the records of their past games that clearly conflicted with that victory condition...
"......I don\'t get it at all.
 This journey through her thinking process is just too rugged."
"Even so, you won\'t give up, will you."
"Yeah.
 .........I promised."
{a:c:
Kill...me.
 ......Let me die......}
"I promised to let her die peacefully.
 ......And I\'m the only one who can do that."
...Beato\'s right ankle was bound with a heavy, cold, steel shackle.
It wasn\'t tied to anything, so it didn\'t restrict her movement.
However, it symbolized restriction.
 It was a visualization of the restriction that prevented her from leaving the game without either victory or loss...
And...the shackle was probably hurting her.
The mercilessly cold steel shackle...
was tormenting her over and over inside her waking dream.
"............Ghh............ah..."
So there was never any relief in her empty expression.
Her eyelids would sometimes tremble like she was having a bad dream, ...and every once in a while, she would let out a pained gasp.
Unless I win,
 ......Beato will never be released from the curse that prevents her from resting in peace...
"...Are you not in a hurry?
 It seems that the fifth game has already started."
"............
 ......I\'m not interested."
Why should I take part in any game without Beato as an opponent...?
If that\'s the only alternative,
 then stepping through past games on a journey in search of Beato\'s thought process is a much better use of my time......
"I\'ll be the next Game Master.
 Any objections?
 You have none, right?"
"......I have tons.
 Beato has abandoned the fight and lost consciousness.
 Isn\'t this loss by default and game over for her...?"
"I\'ll admit a lot\'s happened to Beato, and it feels a teensy bit like she\'s been knocked out right now.
 But that doesn\'t mean she\'s lost the will to fight.
 That\'s why I\'m acting as her assistant.
 Get it?"
Beato was lying down on a deck chair, almost as though she was sleeping.
However, she wasn\'t sleeping,
 ......and she wasn\'t awake either.
She was nothing more than a living doll who had given up on victory, asked Battler to perform her last rites,
 and entrusted everything to him...
Of course, no fifth game would ever be prepared if everyone just sat around.
So, {f:5:Lambdadelta} had succeeded Beato as the Game Master,
 and proclaimed that she would prepare the next game.
"Quit messing around.
 This game is between me and Beato.
 I don\'t know who you two are, but I\'m not gonna just let you carry on without us."
"No one asked your opinion.
 So, Bern?
 Do you accept or not?"
"..................
 ......Sure.
 Go and succeed her position."
"What the hell?! How dare you say that!
 I don\'t know who you two are, but I\'m not gonna let you ignore Beato and me and just carry on by yourselves!"
"Calm down.
 Of course a different player will choose different moves.
 You might have a lot of reason to feel uneasy about the idea,
 but even so, it could give you some big hints, right?"
"Who cares?!!
 And who put you in charge?!!"
".........Beato\'s game has repeated four times, and you still don\'t understand anything, right?
 In that case, I think that changing the player might lead to some huge hints."
"That\'s none of your business!
 This is {i:our} game! Beato prepared it, and she designated me to be her opponent in it.
 I don\'t know what hole you two crept out of, but I don\'t want you screwing things up!"
".........In that case, wake Beato up and make her get the next game ready.
 Can you...?"
"B‐...Beato won\'t be getting up for a while.
 But there\'s no need for a new game.
 Just the four games she\'s already laid out are more than enough!"
"Even if there is to be a fifth game, it just needs to be something that Beato lays out and I challenge.
 You two have absolutely nothing to do with this!"
Battler couldn\'t hide his irritation at these two witches called {f:5:Lambdadelta} and {f:5:Bernkastel},
 who had shown up after the game\'s start and who had started to try and continue it on their own...
It looked like these witches were of an even higher rank than Beato—
so high, in fact, that even Beato\'s master {f:5:Virgilia} couldn\'t come close.
Battler had the feeling that he\'d seen these two several times before.
However, this was the first time he had learned their names and spoken to them directly.
"You can\'t get the next game ready without waking Beato.
 That\'s why I\'m going to prepare it instead!"
"Listen, Battler,
 we aren\'t so patient that we\'re willing to wait however long we have to for Beato to regain consciousness.
 Right, Bern?"
"............I don\'t like boredom.
 It really ticks me off."
"We really don\'t care whether you get bored or not."
"Come on now.
 Leave everything to <perfect> {f:5:Lambdadelta}‐sama, okay?
 I\'ll take over as the Game Master."
"{f:5:Don\'t worry}, I won\'t play with too much "certain perfection".
 I\'ll {i:act all Beato‐like} and prepare plenty of clues, bonus hints, and fakes that make no sense.
 I\'ll make it into one big hint to help you understand Beato\'s world even more, okay?"
Letting my voiceless emotions explode, ...I slammed the table hard.
The two witches barely flinched.
......One grinned.
The other looked indifferent, as though nothing had happened.
The two of them just stared at me silently.
...As though they were reproaching me.
"What\'s this?
 Not satisfied?
 Are you saying you\'ll step down from my fifth game?
 Isn\'t that loss by default?"
".........Battler won\'t step down.
 Of course he\'ll participate in the fifth game."
"Don\'t just decide that yourself!!
 I\'m not gonna play along with you two.
 I don\'t give a shit!"
"Hmmm...
 ......Then it really is loss by default, right...?
 The witch side wins this game,
 the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s submit, and we wrap things up, then...?"
".........If you step down, then you lose by default and the game ends... Are you okay with that?
 .........If you want to make certain that your lonely sister...
will always meet with miserable circumstances in an endless number of worlds, that option is indeed open to you."
When {f:5:Bernkastel} mentioned Ange, .........Battler\'s expression changed instantly.
"H‐......how dare you...
talk about Ange so casually......"
".........It\'s because you have me, the Witch of Miracles {f:5:Bernkastel}, as your ally,
 ...that there exists the possibility of a {i:miracle} in which Ange\'s family might come home to her."
"Well, if you throw that chance away yourself, guaranteeing that Ange\'s endless futures will all end in sorrow, that might be pretty interesting for me too."
I vaguely understood what she was saying.
Until I win in Beato\'s game, I\'ll remain trapped in this bizarre world.
And if I abandon victory, ......then most certainly, my parents and I will never return to Ange.
For Ange\'s sake, ...even though I know that the witches are toying with me,
 I must keep on fighting...
"Nn, ...d‐.........damn......"
".........What\'s wrong?
 You look unsatisfied.
 Did you already forget the anger you felt when your sister was turned into mincemeat......?"
"That spectacle where she was torn to bits, ripped to pieces by countless red‐hot pliers.
 Do you need to look at it directly this time......?"
{f:5:Bernkastel} faced the palm of her right hand upwards.
...As she did, a pale light gathered there, ......and some kind of blue‐glowing crystal appeared there.
......A scene was reflected on its sharp surface,
 ...but it wasn\'t the scene that surrounded them now.
If you looked deep into that crystal, ......that fragment,
 then you would probably learn what was reflected on there.
If you stared at it,
 then you would surely witness that scene where Ange.........finally reached her beloved brother after devoting twelve years of her life to that goal,
 ......only to have her entire body torn to bits while she was still alive.
"D‐......damn...you........."
Without thinking, he grabbed at her collar,
 but as soon as he touched whatever made up her form, it disappeared like foam on the waves.
And then, as naturally as though she had been there from the beginning,
 {f:5:Bernkastel} was leaning against a distant wall.
".........If you step down from the game,
 this will become not just a fragment, but a definite reality.
 I won\'t be the one to weave that future.
 You\'ll do it yourself.
 ......So you decide, alright?
 Figure out what you want to do with your beloved little sister\'s future."
Battler\'s fists shook with anger,
 ......but even if he swung them down, he wouldn\'t be able to hit {f:5:Bernkastel}.
Like a cat or a phantom, this witch wouldn\'t even let someone pet her if she didn\'t wish for it.
Besides, ...she\'s telling the truth.
For Ange\'s sake, I can\'t step down from this fight.
Even if these unpleasant witches hijack the game board.
"Ehheheheheh.
 That\'s just like you, Be~rn.
 Even the way you frighten people into doing what you want is heartless.
 ...That\'s how it is, Battlerr."
"You aren\'t allowed to step down from the game board.
 You and Beato are both nothing more than pieces on the game board who exist to distract us from our boredom.
 ...Even your incomprehensible anger and irritation make for a wonderful treat to sate our boredom."
"Well, this level of anger only makes for a cheap snack."
".........Like those curry‐flavored potato wafers that sell at 30 yen for a pair."
""*giggle*giggle*, ahhahahahahahaha...!!""
"Y‐you damn......witches......"
".........*giggle*.
 Fight for Ange\'s sake, okay?
 And for Beato\'s too, right...?"
In a way that was admonishing, ...or perhaps babying,
 ......{f:5:Bernkastel} smiled, tormenting Battler in a similar way to how something too sweet sometimes gives you a headache.
The host of this tea party, Beato, was absent now,
 ......and the guest witches were already making themselves at home.
"...What\'ll you do, Ushiromiya Battlerr?
 Surrender to faaate...?"
".................."
"Just step down.
 You\'ve had enough of being toyed with as a witch\'s piece, right?
 Eheheheheh, it\'s tough being one of Bern\'s pieces.
 You\'ll be a throwaway just like Ange.
 Geheheheheh!"
"I\'m not giving you the option of stepping down.
 ......Keep fighting for the sake of your sister\'s future.
 I\'m on your side.
 Until you win, I\'ll support you so that you can reach that future...
for all eternity, until I get bored.
 ......*giggle*giggle*."
Battler couldn\'t allow himself to fall for their provocation and cajolery......
These witches knew that he got mad easily, and they were trying to take advantage of that...
...Battler withstood it all, ......and finally relaxed his clenched fists.
".........If you want to start this fifth game of yours, ...then just do it.
 Do whatever you want."
"Oh, I will.
 ......Hey, where are you goi~ng?"
Even though Battler had acknowledged this fifth game, he turned his back on them,
 which surprised {f:5:Lambdadelta} a bit.
"If you\'re going to be Beato\'s substitute,
 ......then I\'m sure that {f:5:Bernkastel} witch over there can be mine if she wants."
".........Not a bad idea.
 Otherwise, this\'ll turn into a loss by default."
"What the heck?!
 Are you gonna just ignore this Episode 5 that I put so much effort into making?!
 Rude, ruuude!"
"......Battler says he\'s going to take a break for a while.
 Until he comes back, I\'ll be the substitute player.
 How\'s that sound...? Battler...?"
".........You do that."
"............"
"......What\'s wrong, Lambda?
 If your opponent is me and not that fool Battler, you won\'t play...?"
"Ehheheheheh!!
 Of course I will♪
 I\'m glad I get to play with you, Be~rn!
 Come on, let\'s play, let\'s play!
 Let\'s play together in {f:5:Lambdadelta}‐sama\'s super <hyper> and <cute> Episode 5~!"
".........This is a world that Beato created, remember.
 You aren\'t going to ruin the atmosphere of the story, are you...?"
"Don\'t worry about that.
 I\'m really good at reading between the lines for that sort of stuff.
 I made sure to use a Beato‐ish atmosphere {i:and} I made it into an even {i:more} interesting story."
"Battler, make sure you come back as soon as your break\'s over, okay?
 It\'d be a shame to miss this.
 I\'ve prepared plenty of bonus hints that\'ll get you closer to Beato\'s secre~t♪"
"...Is what it\'ll look like but I\'ll actually fill it with misdirection and make things more and more confusi~ng.
 Wait, hey, Battlerr! Why aren\'t you listening when a witch is talking?!"
Without answering, Battler disappeared into the darkness.
After shrugging and cackling,
 the witches immediately started playing with the game board they had stolen from Beato......
"Can those witches really understand Beato\'s game?"
"...Since they\'re using the same game board, they cannot do anything that this child cannot do.
 However, they can do things that she wouldn\'t do."
"............
 ...What do you mean, things she wouldn\'t do?"
"The materials of chess exist to play chess with.
 You {i:cannot} use them to play cards.
 However, as for throwing the chess pieces at your opponent, or scribbling on the board..."
"Doing such things is not impossible.
 However, that would be blasphemy against the game of chess,
 so people {i:don\'t do that}."
"....................."
That definitely......wouldn\'t be chess anymore.
It looked like Beato\'s eyes clouded very slightly with sadness.
".........Damn them.
 .........This game is between me and Beato.
 ...I won\'t let anyone else profane it."
At that time, gold butterflies gathered and Ronove appeared, holding a tea set with black tea.
"Would you like some more tea?"
".........If you wouldn\'t mind."
"Certainly.
 ......So,
 how has this journey of yours in search of Milady\'s thoughts been?"
"I\'m as clueless as ever, but I\'m enjoying it."
"On a different topic, ......are you certain about this?
 Relaxing here, I mean."
"......Are you talking about the game those witches are playing all by themselves?"
"Yes.
 Just now, when I went to serve them some tea, the murders of the first twilight had already taken place,
 and it seemed as though the next murder would occur shortly."
When Beato and I were playing,
 the game would be paused whenever someone left their seats.
......However, those witches wouldn\'t pause that game just because I wasn\'t around...
"............Ronove, did you see their game?"
"Just a part of it."
"How was it?"
Ronove lifted the pot high with an elegant gesture as he poured the black tea.
After he was done, he finally spoke,
 expressing his thoughts in very few words.
"It did not have...love."
"......What do you mean, love?"
"My apologies.
 That is how it would be put if a woman were to say it.
 ......As a man,
 ......perhaps one could say it was dishonorable."
I understood what those words meant.
When I met {f:5:Virgilia}\'s eyes, she shook her head slightly and stared at the floor...
".........At a glance, I believe it resembles Milady\'s games greatly.
 However, the foundation is very different."
"Does it go against the rules of Beato\'s game?"
"No, it does not.
 {f:5:Lambdadelta}‐sama understands the rules of Milady\'s game very well indeed.
 ......However..."
".................."
Battler stood up.
There was no need to make Ronove say any more.
"Battler‐kun......"
"......Sorry, Ronove.
 I know you went to all the trouble of pouring this for me, but tea isn\'t what I need."
"You will go after all?"
"Yeah.
 ......We don\'t need any outsiders in our game."
...Those guys weren\'t even here in the beginning.
Because I\'ve been loafing about, crazier and crazier witches have been introduced,
 ......and now they\'ve hijacked this game between me and Beato.
"I\'ve got to take it back.
 ......I\'m supposed to be the one taking care of Beato\'s game board now.
 ...That means I shouldn\'t just sit around here."
"......Thank you.
 I wanted to let this child hear those words."
"I\'m sure she hears them.
 ......Milady is simply unable to answer."
Beato lay there silently, like a living doll with dull eyes...
The game board that she had created herself had been hijacked by incomprehensible people and was being turned into a mess...
Beato had called on me to be her opponent.
Then this game must be something she created for me.
I\'ve......got to take it back.
"......You just wait here.
 I\'m going to take it back."
"....................."
Of course, Beato didn\'t respond in any way.
 ......That\'s right.
If she can\'t respond, ...then I have to protect it in her place.
"I\'ll be right back.
 ......{f:5:Virgilia}, Ronove.
 ...I\'m counting on you two to look after this golden sleeping princess."
"Yes. Leave it to us."
"......See you later, Battler‐kun.
 And please,
 ......try to discover some part of this child in their game without her.
 If you can,
 ......then it will mean that you have fought with her, even in her absence."
".........You\'re right.
 ...Yeah,
 ......this is no goddamn good at all.
 What am I doing?"
Let\'s go.
 ...And let\'s take it back.
"Sorry to keep you waiting, witches!!
 My break is over!!"
When he faced the jet‐black heavens and yelled this,
 the whole world shattered, as though it were made out of thin glass.
Then, ......as though it had been that way since the beginning,
 .........it transformed into that smoking room where Battler had fought Beato so many times, ...and which the two witches had now hijacked.
"What do you think you\'re doing?
 You\'re only coming back now?
 It\'s way too late!
 Not only has the game reached the second day, it\'s already at the finale!"
".........You never showed up, so I just advanced things on my own."
Yeah, like you ever even waited for me in the first place...
"Bern was waaay sharper and more thrilling than you were. Right?!"
"Shut up.
 I\'m the player here.
 You substitute witches can just take a step back now."
".........Well, I don\'t really mind if you join in starting now, but there\'s probably no need for you anymore."
"Seriously.
 After all, we\'re already at the climax!
 After this, Bern will probably corner me and win."
"What the hell.........?!"
".........Why not, though?
 Let\'s let him watch the final moves."
"Yeah.
 Come on over, Ushiromiya Battler.
 It\'s almost completely over, but here\'s the <cute> and <elegant> game I made!"
"Episode 5:
 End of the
 Golden Witch!"
Right now, no humans exist on this island except for those in this parlor.
And with one exception, it has been shown that none of them have committed murder.
And the culprit is among these people.
"......Whoa, whoa.
 ...In that case, ...it\'s conclusive, isn\'t it...?"
"Unless the culprit is a witch who committed murder with magic, that is..."
"............It was you?!
 You killed George, killed my husband?!
 Why?!!
 Whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy?!!"
"I, ...I didn\'t kill anyone...!
 I, I, d‐didn\'t do...!!"
"....................."
In a panic, and with a voice that really couldn\'t be called flowing,
 ......in a manner that was, to put it coldly, unsightly...Aunt Natsuhi denied the suspicion placed upon her...
However, ......there was no longer any way around it...
{i:The girl} stood up, ...brushed back her long hair, pointed at Aunt Natsuhi, and said it one more time.
"......You are the culprit.
 Ushiromiya Natsuhi‐san."
