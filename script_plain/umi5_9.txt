......The sound of crashing waves.
The sound of the tide surging.
 The noise of the sea breeze.
Whenever my headache torments me, these are the sounds that fill my head......
My inability to bear a successor placed me in a very difficult position within the Ushiromiya family...
I tried every medication that was said to promote fertility, every incense or herb,
 ......but nothing I tried had any effect.
Until I was blessed with Jessica 18 years ago,
 ......I was ashamed to even call myself a wife.
"......The creation of a child depends on the efforts of two people and the whims of heaven.
 It\'s not fair to place all the blame on yourself."
"I still don\'t know what caused my inability to become pregnant.
 I even went to see noted physicians.
 I underwent humiliating examinations.
 ......But I was always just told that they didn\'t understand the reason..."
"Even though quite some time had passed since your marriage, you still couldn\'t bear a child.
 ......I see.
 It\'s only natural that Eva, who secretly aspired to become the next head, would start getting ideas..."
Eva tried to convince Father that I was a failure as a future head\'s wife.
It was a time when Kinzo was also very disappointed in my husband\'s repeated business failures.
On the other hand, Eva\'s husband Hideyoshi\'s business was growing well, completely the opposite of my husband\'s business.
......He was the only person who could bring Father good news.
In that case, perhaps there could be no blame placed on Father if he decided to lend an ear to Eva\'s words...
...or even accept them without question.
It was all my fault, because I couldn\'t bear a child...
"You are sinless.
 Aren\'t babies of this country carried here by storks?
 If anyone is to be judged, it should be the stork."
"...............Thank you.
 However, ...even though he was still in good health then, the head was already well past his prime,
 and it\'s not hard to imagine that he wanted to see his grandchildren\'s faces as soon as possible..."
"Who cares.
 If he wanted a grandchild, he could have just done what he wanted with that appalling amount of money he had.
 ......This is Kinzo, the man who always bragged about how money could create anything.
 If he wanted a grandchild, why couldn\'t he just manage something with that money he was so proud of...?!"
"..................Yes, ......that\'s right.
 ......The head......gave up on me when I couldn\'t bear a child...
...and did just that."
......Thinking it the duty of anyone in possession of large amounts of money, the head gave a lot to charities.
One among these, the facility known as the "Gospel House", had been given an especially large donation, possibly because he had old ties with that place.
"Ah, the Gospel House.
 ......Furniture came from that place quite often."
"As part of their work training and public activity,
 the head employed Gospel House children with exceptional grades as servants.
 ......All of the servants in the mansion with the character "{ruby:in/on/non:{p:0:音}}" in their names—Shannon, Kanon, Lunon, Manon, Lenon, and more besides—
were children from there."
"......There were quite a lot of them, weren\'t there...
 Though most quit after just a few years."
"That\'s probably because a few years of wages from working here would earn them more than enough to live on their own.
 ......Experience as a servant for the Ushiromiya family is a wonderful thing to add to one\'s resumé.
 I\'m sure it was also the head\'s desire for them to gain this for themselves and then spread their wings in society."
"............I see.
 ......So, an adopted child........."
".............................."
"F‐Father......
 What......did you just say......?"
"Accept this infant as my grandchild."
"Ohhh...... There, there.
 There, there..."
Apparently, the baby Kumasawa was trying to soothe didn\'t like the air in the study at all.
...It kept on crying as if it hated it here......
"M‐...my apologies, Father...
 ......I\'m not sure what you want me......"
"Accept this infant as my grandchild.
 You shall raise it to be the one who succeeds Krauss."
"......In other words, ......you want my husband and I to raise this baby...as our own child......?"
"That\'s right.
 It\'s clear by now that you are barren.
 ......Your body must have some sort of defect."
"Ooh... There, there.
 Ooh, there, there......"
As though she couldn\'t hear our discussion in the slightest, Kumasawa kept on persistently trying to cuddle the baby.
This made its crying get even louder......
"............That\'s nonsense.
 If all the responsibility of giving birth rested with the woman, this world would have no need for men."
"I\'ve never forgotten the bitter pain I felt that day......
 ......Of {i:course} I wanted a child......
 ......But no matter how much I prayed, I couldn\'t get pregnant......
 Thinking that something to do with my body might be the cause, I went to see several famous doctors.
 But even so, no matter how hard I tried, ......I couldn\'t become pregnant......"
"After all that, ......for this to be how you were treated...
 ............I understand."
The baby had been picked up by the Gospel House just recently.
Of course, it wasn\'t that I didn\'t feel compassion for the child,
 who was so young and who had already lost its parents\' affection.
However, .........the pain and sadness I felt were far greater.
It would have been another story if I had suffered to bear this child,
 ......but why...
...did I have to cradle this baby,
 who not only shared none of my blood,
 but who was not related to my husband in the slightest either......?
"I don\'t hate Father.
 ......If anything, ......I only hated my own body...!
 I detested it!
 I truly detested my own body for being unable to bear a child......!!
 So I prayed.
 I prayed to both angels and demons!!
 And my wishes were granted by both...!"
"......What did you pray to the angels?"
"I prayed for a miracle in my body...!
 If there was something wrong with my body, I could accept that.
 But I wanted to overcome that defect and somehow be granted the miracle of my husband\'s child...!"
"......That wish came true.
 ......The next year, you gave birth to Jessica."
"And......what did you pray to the demons?"
"I couldn\'t stand it,
 I couldn\'t stand it......
 I cursed this body of mine...!
 And I cursed this baby,
 ......who was the living reminder of my failure...!!"
".........What did you wish for?"
"For the first time in my life, I prayed and wished to demons...!!
 I wished that this baby would simply disappear!!"
......Of course, that wish was also granted...by demons.
On that day, I left the baby with one of the older servants and went to think about the future in the rose garden.
No, that\'s a lie.
 ......I just wanted to clear my mind of everything.
The baby\'s cries were aggravating,
 so I ordered the servant to take the baby to a place where I couldn\'t hear.
......By a place where I couldn\'t hear, I meant somewhere far away.
Yes, I wished.
......I wished for the servant to take the baby far away and never return...!!
"I see......
 ......So, a passing demon heard your wish, Natsuhi‐sama."
"And then, ......what happened next?"
"After that...was a bizarre accident that could only have been granted me by a demon..."
The woodland path from the rose garden to the harbor is certainly well suited for a pleasant walk.
......And from time to time, if the mood took you, it would undoubtedly feel good to veer off the path and take a walk through the trees.
However, .........wouldn\'t that be venturing a little too far for a walk with a baby in your arms...?
"There was a cliff on the other side.
 It was......about ten meters high, I think.
 It was rocky below.
 ...There was even a fence there!
 Are we to suppose that the servant deliberately walked all the way over there holding the baby,
 and then leaned against the fence...?!
 The only conceivable explanation is that she was lured there by the beckoning of a demon!!"
"............So she was lured there.
 ......A demon who heard your wish lured that servant there......"
"So then, ......the servant and the baby..."
"They died...!!
 They fell from the cliff, down to the rocks below...!
 No, they died because I wished it!
 That means this is my—"
"It isn\'t your fault!
 There\'s no need to think about it any further."
"But it happened because I wished it......!!"
"No, that\'s wrong!
 Making wishes is one thing, but it is only at the whims of gods, demons, and witches that they may be granted!
 You bear no sin.
 {y:0:Human}{n:0:Human}s bear no sin.
 You can even claim that I killed them if you so desire.
 No, I did kill them!
 I took pity upon your misery, and I lured the servant with the baby to the cliff and led them down it!"
"It was simply an unfortunate accident.
 If you cannot accept that explanation, then blame it on us.
 That\'s why demons exist."
".........That\'s right.
 We\'re here for your sake.
 .....It\'s not like you killed them.
 We killed them.
 So you are sinless.
 ......So please, don\'t blame yourself, Natsuhi."
"Is that true......?
 Am I truly sinless......?!"
"Yeah, you are.
 Fuhhahahahaha!!
 Young one who claims revenge for 19 years ago.
 If you\'re going to curse someone, curse me.
 However, witches have a patent on curses...!
 Let me take on this fight you\'re trying to pick with Natsuhi!!"
{e:090:I am the Ushiromiya family alchemist, {f:5:Beatrice} the Golden}!
{e:090:If anyone picks a fight with the master I serve, I will fight in my master\'s stead}!
{e:090:Revenge for 19 years ago, you say}?
{e:090:I\'ll make you learn that\'s not even a blink of an eye for a witch who\'s lived a thousand years}!!
{e:090:Gahahahahahaahahahahahahahaha}!!
{e:090:So, you hate Natsuhi for wishing your death 19 years ago}?!
{e:090:Let me make you remember just who it was that lured you off that cliff}...!!
......As the middle‐aged female servant cuddled the sobbing baby, she walked on a small path through the trees...
Natsuhi had told her that the baby was too loud, so she tried to get as far from the rose garden as she could.
......She was completely unaware as to why she\'d gone out of her way to head in this direction.
However, the sobbing baby...
...suddenly stopped crying.
Something was reflected in its eyes, but the servant couldn\'t tell what.
However, thinking that the baby had stopped because it had taken an interest in something,
 ......she headed in the direction of the baby\'s gaze...
The baby had seen......a group of gold butterflies disappearing off into the trees.
And.........on the other side of the trees, ...the servant saw a woman.
.........Who?
 It was someone she didn\'t recognize, someone who couldn\'t possibly have been there.
The baby stopped crying and stared in that direction.
{n}...Then, the servant\'s legs started to automatically carry her that way...
"Come this way, woman.
 .........Bring that cursed baby with you."
"...........................Ah......"
The woman couldn\'t disobey.
......She was completely overwhelmed by Beato\'s gold‐glowing eyes...
She walked lightly, as though through a dream world.
......At some point, the scenery around her had changed,
 ......but she did not notice.
 She could not notice...
Though this should have been Rokkenjima,
 ......at some point, it had become the garden of a mansion she had never seen before.
It was a garden she had never seen before, even grander than the great rose garden of the Ushiromiya family......a garden of gold roses.
There stood an arbor,
 ......and a woman wearing an elegant dress beckoning her.........
...There was a man who looked like a butler, and the tea he poured with a beautiful gesture had a very nice and enticing smell.
It was as though they were telling her to join their tea party......
She couldn\'t disobey.
.........She had to go to the master of this golden rose garden...
......and give this child as an offering......
"Forgive me, woman.
 Curse your bad luck for being entranced by a witch.
 ......And, surrounded by these gold roses, which you would never be able to enjoy in this world, sleep.
 .........Gaap."
".........Yes, understood."
When Gaap snapped her fingers,
 ......a pitch‐black hole opened at the woman\'s feet, and she was swallowed up along with the baby.
The sight that the woman and the baby witnessed in the very next moment probably burned itself into their eyes forever.
The two floated in the air......and looked down at the gold rose garden spread out below them.
Below their feet was not the ground, but an unobstructed view of a golden rose garden which stretched as far as the eye could see.
If one could have this scene imprinted in their mind as their last memory, that would be such a merciful way to die......
Then, the woman and the baby were swallowed up by the golden sea.
The {i:thud} was remarkably plain, and remarkably quiet for the sound of two lives being taken.
......However, it was a perfect fit for the entertainment at a tea party of witches.
Darkness swallowed the woman and the baby, ......and slowly expanded to engulf the entire rose garden...
The sound of the wind grew stronger bit by bit.
...Was that TV static?
 What was that noise...?
......It was the roar of the sea.
The two who had died after falling from a great height into a thicket of golden roses...
...were gradually engulfed by the roar of the sea, engulfed by the scenery of the beach below the cliff...
"I guarantee it.
 You are completely sinless!!
 If someone wants revenge for 19 years ago, they need look no further than me!!
 Wahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha!!"
"...Ee......eeeeeeeeeeeeekkk.........!"
When I spotted the two of them on the rocks below, ......I went pale.
Then, I dashed back to the mansion......and there was a great uproar.
We urgently rushed them to hospital by boat, ......but from that height, it was a miracle that they had even avoided an instant death.
Both the servant...
...and the baby...
......died.
In less than three days from the time Father had entrusted me with the baby, ......I had killed it...!
My husband was on a business trip.
Rosa‐san, who still lived on the island at the time, was away traveling with her friends.
......Father and I were the only ones on Rokkenjima!!
And before anyone except Father and I knew,
 ......a baby had appeared out of nowhere...and then disappeared again!!
That\'s right, it was a dream...a nightmare!!
I was convinced that Father would blame me.
...However, his reaction was somehow strange...!
"Heh, ......heh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eheh, fwaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahha{0}hhahaha!!
 I saw this coming, I {i:knew} this would happen!
 How long must you struggle?
 To what lengths will you go to escape being mine?!!
 Waha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haa{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha!!
 I have no interest in an empty cage!
 Throw it away!!"
When Father learned of the accident,
 he kept on laughing and laughing, as though nothing could be more amusing, to the point that just listening to him disturbed me.
Perhaps something had come loose in his mind......
That was the day that changed him.
Father shut himself up inside the world of the occult even more than he ever had before......
When my husband came back, he was astonished to see how eccentric Father had now become.
However, ......he had already accepted that this would happen sooner or later.
Of course, my husband had heard about the baby.
However, he told me that it was surely just some whim of Father\'s, and to forget the whole episode.
So I forgot it!
It was an unfortunate accident.
No, there wasn\'t an accident at all!
I forgot everything, even that the baby had existed in the first place...!!
After all, it was a twisted nightmare which lasted not even three days!
{n}That\'s right, it was all a nightmare...!!
I don\'t want to remember any of it!!
The cliff, the broken fence, the roar of the sea,
 and......the wailing of that baby.........!!!
"So, that baby.........is the baby of 19 years ago?"
"Of course not!
 I killed that baby!
 It no longer exists in this world!"
"......However, there is no red truth in the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} world.
 In the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} world, nothing can be trusted."
"............That\'s right.
 Beato, you definitely killed that baby.
 But in the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} world, it might still be considered alive.
 ......Whether {i:it\'s really alive or not}, catch my drift?"
"Are you saying.........that it actually was alive?!
 After falling to the rocks from that height......?!"
"I don\'t know.
 But calm down.
 ......No matter how much that person hates you, the truth is that it was an accident.
 If he does hate you, that hatred is completely unjustified...!"
"But, but...!
 Even if I didn\'t lay a finger on him, ......inside my heart, I...!!"
"Calm down.
 ......No matter who the man from 19 years ago hates or what he yells, there\'s no way the sin he\'s after actually occurred.
 So calm down.
 Why don\'t I welcome the man from 19 years ago as my guest?
 *cackle*cackle*cackle*!"
"And just when the riddle was solved and I thought my job was finished.
 I\'ve got to entertain this final guest of mine!!
 Kuhhya{0}hya{0}hya{0}hya{0}hya!!"
"It\'s getting interesting.
 ......Not only are you protecting Lord {f:5:Goldsmith}\'s secret, but you also have a 19th guest and a man from 19 years ago."
".........That\'s right—to us who claim that Kinzo is alive, Erika is number 19.
 And in addition to that 19th piece, we have a man from 19 years ago?
 How interesting. I\'m getting all excited."
"We have no lack of opponents!!
 And I was just thinking it a shame to have only one guest at my tea party!!
 Come, you fools!!
 Kuhha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haa{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haa{0}hahah!!"
Furudo Erika is Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}\'s piece.
{n}In that case, whose piece is the man from 19 years ago......?
The voice which could be faintly overheard through the receiver...was Natsuhi\'s.
"I, ......I understand.
 I\'ll sleep right now.
 I won\'t leave my room, and I won\'t pick up the phone...!
 So please, don\'t tell my husband and daughter......!"
When heard through a receiver, even these begging screams which would have shaken the heart of anyone who heard them...
......could be listened to with a heart of ice...
"As long as you keep our promise, I\'ll keep your secret, Mother.
 ......Don\'t break our promise.
 .........I\'m already very close by.
 I can easily tell whether you\'ve turned your lights off and whether you\'re on the phone.
 ...If I wished to, I could even kiss your sleeping face."
"I\'ll keep it!
 I\'ll keep my promise!!
 So stop it, just stop it!
 Stop iiii{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}iittt!!"
The receiver was set down violently.
......“He” knew very well how bad an aftertaste you could leave for the other side just by the way you hung up the phone...
"Okay, good night, Mother.
 ............And there you go!
 Now Natsuhi won\'t come out of her room tonight."
".........That\'s a clever trick.
 You can change your voice?"
"*giggle*!
 Anyone can change their voice.
 A sweet voice when begging Papa for a favor{p:0:♪}
 A hoarse‐sounding voice when taking the day off school.
 An apologetic voice when turning down a friend that you actually hate!
 {f:5:If you want}{p:0:♪},
 {p:0:I can do~}
 {p:0:{nobr:ａｎｙ} {nobr:ｖｏｉｃｅ☆}}
 at all~!"
".........You should stop being a witch and become a voice actress."
"Heheheheheheheh!
 So, are all the pieces set up for both of us now?
............‘Furudo Erika’.
 What a wonderful piece.
 She suits you so much more than Ange did, Bern."
"............Your praise honors me, Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}."
"The pleasure is mine.
 ......Mmm, she really is wonderful.
 Super adorable.
 I\'m dying to break her spirit with my witch illusions and see her face twist in humiliation."
"......Hear that?
 ......Don\'t embarrass me, okay?
 Show me that you\'re a much more useful piece than Ange was."
"Yes, leave it to me.
 Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}, my master.
 ......I\'m nothing like that gloomy, dull, utterly charmless piece."
"*giggle*giggle*giggle*!
 She\'s so right.
 The only useful thing that Ange did was get turned into meat chunks to fire Battler up!"
"We have no interest at all in family love or sibling love!
 The game we want to see is more gruesome and sticky!
 A <grotesque>, <pop>, and <cute> murder case!!"
".........If Natsuhi is the king, then I wonder if Beato is the queen.
 *giggle*.
 The pack of witches and furniture guarding Natsuhi is less like a set of chess pieces and more like—"
"Bowling pins, right?!
 Kyahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha!!
 Illusions of Natsuhi and Beato,
 Kinzo and the worthless furniture!
 Entertain us a bit, will you?!"
"Especially Beato!
 We\'re bored of you now!
 That "Legend of the Witch" murder game of yours is over!
 And your time is up too!!"
"This game board is Bern\'s and mine now.
 It\'ll suit you to be reduced to one of our pieces and toyed with for all eternity!!"
"*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*.
 Both Natsuhi and Beato are sacks of filthy, rotten truth, just entrails wrapped up in a thin layer of skin.
 ......Tearing that to shreds and dragging the insides out will be one of my—
no, one of {i:our} few pleasures."
"Yes, you can have a lot of fun with it.
 Hey, are you watching?
 {f:5:Beatrice}?
 Look at how much fun can be had playing with your board.
 I\'ll show you.
 A fifth game that\'s actually fun!!"
".........It\'s a bit sad if we\'re the only ones having a pleasant chat.
 Why don\'t you let Beato talk too?"
"Hear that?
 I\'ll give you special permission to talk.
 What do you hope to gain from this latest game?!"
"......................................."
"Ahahahaha!
 Nothing, she says!
 That\'s right, that\'s right!
 You\'re the loser who got crushed by Battler!
 Leave it to me, okay?
 I\'ll put the witch side on top in a snap!
 But I\'m gonna be sacrificing you as a piece in the process!!"
"What a dreadful loss of face for {f:5:Beatrice}, keeper of the gold, to have her epitaph so easily solved before the first twilight.
 ......*giggle*giggle*!!"
"......Isn\'t it great that you\'ve been left as a piece as part of Natsuhi\'s fantasy?
 ......Well, except that we\'re treating you as a pin now instead of a piece."
"The Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice} is out of the picture now!
 In my game, you and your furniture only have a teeny‐tiny role, a loser\'s role!!
 You can enjoy getting tossed and thrown around and made into toys for me and Bern!!"
".........If that\'s not what you want, just tell us to stop.
 And we\'ll stop."
"......................................."
"She doesn\'t mind!
 *giggle*giggle*!!
 Pin confirmed!!"
"Ahhahaha...ahhahahahahaha!"
""Kyahhha{0}hah{0}hah{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hah{0}hha{0}ha{0}hah{0}gwa{0}hyah{0}haha{0}aah!!!""
There\'s no need for a Golden Witch anymore.
All that\'s needed is a sacrificial doll so that we two witches can enjoy some time playing.
Die, die, disappear.
Confess to your filthy past and your crimes,
 pour out your sob story of regret and repentance as you throw yourself off a cliff and die!!
There will be no more appearances for the Golden Witch......!!
Ahhah{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haah{0}hah{0}haa{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haa{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha...!!
"......................................."
"...............Beato..."
This will be......a most horrible game.
On the surface, it does look very similar to the usual tales.
However, ......there is no respect given to the true main characters of this tale.
This is supposed to be the tale to which the Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice} invited Ushiromiya Battler.
However, the host has been lost, and there is no longer a guest.
{n}......With both inviter and invitee now gone, only the worst kind of tale remains.
{a:c:Welcome to the fifth game:
{n}End of the Golden Witch.
{n}Welcome to a party with neither host nor guests,{nobr: hijacked by wicked witches......}}
".........Ready, Battler?
 The second day is about to start.
 Heheheheh! I hate Beato\'s kind of slow, plodding storytelling!"
"Do your worst.
 ......No matter how much you mess things up, I\'m still gonna reach the truth of this game."
"*giggle*.
 .........As you must.
 For the sake of your little sister, if nothing else."
".............................."
"Don\'t worry.
 ......Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta} may be a far more terrifying opponent than that fool {f:5:Beatrice},
 but I\'ll be giving you plenty of support, so there won\'t be any problems.
 ......Let\'s work together, and this time we\'ll expose the witch illusions for what they really are."
".........I don\'t give a damn about you.
 I won\'t accept anything or anyone that wasn\'t a part of Beato\'s games, and I don\'t need your help."
"Is now really the time to act tough?
 .........Oh well, let\'s both give it our all, okay?
 Together, let\'s tear the witch illusions to shreds.
 *giggle*giggle*!"
Erika brazenly put her hand out for me to shake.
...Instead of just passively ignoring this,
 I gave her an active and clear answer by knocking her hand aside.
".........*giggle*.
 Looks like he hates shaking hands.
 Just like Ange."
"Don\'t worry.
 I\'m a far more useful piece than Ange.
 ......I\'m nothing at all like shredded meat that couldn\'t accomplish anything besides restoring Battler‐san\'s fighting spirit."
"..........................."
"*giggle*...!
 Isn\'t it great that you\'ve been blessed with such helpful‐looking allies?!
 In the past, it was {f:5:Virgilia} and Ronove.
 Then Ange came as well."
"And now you have Bern and Erika!
 There are so many pieces supporting you!
 And despite all of that, you still can\'t get even a glimpse of the truth! How does it feel to be that incompetent?! How does it feel?!"
".........It doesn\'t matter.
 This battle is between me and Beato.
 Everyone else besides us...doesn\'t matter."
"Oh, is that true?
 Are you finally standing on your own?!
 You\'ve always had someone helping you or showing you mercy, so I wonder just how far you\'ll get on your own!
 I\'m gonna enjoy watching this!"
"......I\'m taking it back.
 .........This is our game.
 ......You two aren\'t invited!!"
"*giggle*.
 Yes, that\'s true.
 .........This is your game.
 Then show us you\'re capable of reclaiming it.
 ......You couldn\'t even win Beato\'s games when she went easy on you at every turn.
 Show us how far you can take Lambda\'s completely ruthless game without anyone\'s help!"
"Now awaken, Ushiromiya Battler!! Welcome to the morning of October 5th!!"
