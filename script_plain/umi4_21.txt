Scattered over the big bed were cute jellybeans of various colors,
 and chocolate coins.
A fork was stuck into the shortcake peeking out of a gift box,
 and there were decanters with drinks of various colors lined up on the side table.
But the venomous color of the drink poured into the glass matched none of the decanters.
Someone had probably been playing around, mixing them together.
The taste aside, that was a lot of fun to do.
On top of the fluffy bed were several colorful, big pillows stuffed with dreams.
And on this big bed that looked like something out of a child\'s dream world,
 {f:5:Bernkastel} lay face down,
 and {f:5:Lambdadelta} lay face up, hugging a pillow and relaxing......
"Ahahhahahhahhah, this one was a real rush, wasn\'t it?
 I got re~ally anxious when Beato said she\'d stop the game."
".....................What a rude witch, to start a game of this scale and try to end it by throwing it away."
"Wasn\'t Ange a good piece?
 After Beato ran for it, Ange dragged her back and made her resume the game.
 It\'s too bad that she gave Battler a bit too much enthusiasm, though."
"..................Because she knew Battler is weak against emotions."
"No kidding.
 He looked like he might even go easy on his enemy Beato."
"............Based on the previous game, I was uneasy that he might start to feel compassion for Beato, and take the game in an odd direction.
 .........Ange was a trump card to get Battler back on track if and when he mistook his goal."
".........In truth, I wanted to have her support him a bit more before playing her out.
 She really did play and discard herself straight away.
 What a waste for a piece that required so much preparation."
"Ehheheheh!
 I\'m so~ glad I shackled her with the rule about not giving her name!
 If I hadn\'t set that up, the brother‐sister tag team would have swallowed Beato up and won in the blink of an eye."
"............I thought it was my chance to apply a lot of pressure at once,
 but you were watching her so closely that I couldn\'t make the best use of her.
 ......Aaah, what a waste that piece was."
"Well, yeah? That piece was super OP, I needed her out of there, like, yesterday.
 Well, in the end, she did a good job of preventing the game from being suspended, I guess, and that helps me out too.
 Her actions ended up matching both of our interests, so in that sense, she really was a wonderful piece."
"..................She was an innocent kid like Battler, so it was easy to get her to do as I said.
 .........An idiot or an impulsive type, one of those two is always best for a piece.
 ......Aaah, that piece really could have been so much more."
"And now she\'s mincemeat!
 Hey, let\'s make hamburgers out of that later on{p:0:☆}
 Oh wait, didn\'t you like gyoza more?
 I wonder what little sister tastes like, *giggle*, so funny!"
"..................Is it really alright for you to be so relaxed?
 Battler got fired up thanks to Ange.
 He started going after Beato like a madman, and now, the game has taken a big turn to my advantage, I\'d say...?
 In fact, didn\'t Battler just solve almost all of the mysteries so far?"
"Huuh?
 Not even clo~se!
 Almost all of Battler\'s blue truth is wrong!
 Beato\'s wishy‐washy red is full of holes.
 Anyone with half a brain could slip through it easily just by rattling off some random BS."
"......Ahhh, that really ticked me off.
 If that had been me, I\'d have made sure to cut down every one of those things with the red."
"............Oh, really?
 I was under the impression that those were all the correct answers.
 ......Well, of course, I did have my suspicions about all that stuff to do with swallowing small bombs."
"And Battler\'s blue truths, not all of them were even valid.
 ......Beato stated clearly that, within the first game, she
 
guarantees the identities of all unidentified corpses}!
 That breaks Battler\'s reasoning about the culprit of the Eva/Hideyoshi locked‐room murder being someone who used a fake corpse."
"Next, he said that Kanon\'s death in the boiler room was probably an accident, but...*giggle*!
 What kind of accident could end up with him driving a stake into his own chest?
 How dumb is that?
 I\'ll slice it with that red treasured sword or whatever."
"
Kanon did not die in an accident}!
 For the next one, the murders of the three including Genji in the parlor, the thought that it was a simultaneous murder where they shot each other in a clockwise pattern at the same time is laughable.
 
Genji, Kumasawa, and Nanjo were not killers}!"
"The final trap X for Natsuhi\'s murder is really dumb, too.
 
The thing that shot Natsuhi wasn\'t a trap, it was a real shooting murder with a gun raised and trigger pulled}!
 *giggle*, my condolences...!"
"......Stop that.
 You mustn\'t say something like that in red.
 That kid\'s trying to make it so that she killed Natsuhi by bouncing Natsuhi\'s bullet back at her with magic."
"Oh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho, oopsie, you\'re right, I forgot...!
 Even his blue truths for the second game were too naive."
"

When the six were murdered in the chapel, the culprit was inside the chapel}!
 That guy tries to explain every little thing with trap X.
 What the heck is trap X, some weird mystery novel cliché?"
"And in the incident where Nanjo and Kumasawa were killed in the servant room, it\'s ludicrous to say that someone inherited Kanon\'s name.
 
The only one who can go by the name of Kanon is the person himself}!
 
No other human can adopt that name}!"
"And that theory about borrowing the master key from Rosa for Natsuhi\'s room is also worthless!"
"
After the master keys came into Rosa\'s control, never did any of them leave her hands}!
 
Except for the time when she lent one to Battler to unlock Natsuhi\'s room}.
 I could go on, but this is enough just for a quick look, I guess?"
"............A quick look? You\'ve just denied Battler\'s blue truth for the first and second games across the board.
 .........My, my, what a thing.
 Battler would faint if he heard that."
"......See?
 Beato wasn\'t cornered at all.
 .........I always thought she was a pretty good actress."
"I\'m sure the plan is to make it look like she got cornered this game,
 and then sometime next game, swish!, she\'ll slice it in half with a single red stroke and make Battler\'s eyes pop out."
"*giggle*, and then I\'m sure she\'ll say it with a huge grin on her face.
 "A witch is never in trouble~"!
 Pff, *giggle*giggle*giggle*!!"
"...............Then that whole tragic feeling as though Beato was getting cornered was all an act?"
"Obviously?!
 She really is a great actress!
 Even though she wasn\'t cornered at all, it felt like a last‐episode climax to put everyone else to shame!"
"She\'s totally the winner for best supporting actress this year!!
 Oh, but of course I\'m the sta~r!
 Or it could be you, Be~rn!"
"............At the end, she said things like "kill me" and laid out a big riddle.
 Wasn\'t that her last stand, with Beato to be finished for good if that riddle was solved?"
"*giggle*giggle*...!
 No way, you were tricked too, Bern?"
"That wasn\'t even close to a last stand!
 Beato still has some hellishly brutal moves she\'s keeping hidden.
 ......When she stuck out both arms to give the final riddle, did you notice how she brought her right arm back down?"
"......Ah, now that you mention it.
 .........So that\'s what that meant."
"Sure is!
 She still had plenty of hidden moves left!
 And none of the mysteries have been solved...!"
"That tension, as though she\'d been completely seen through and it was like "Tune in next time for the final episode!"
 She truly is a genius at acting.
 Ahh, I can\'t wait to see her knock Battler back down to rock bottom!"
"She\'s really taken to that "North Wind and the Sun Strategy" from the last game, I think!
 I bet Battler will sympathize with Beato again and fall for it completely...!
 A woman\'s single tear can trick a man, after all—now that\'s value, don\'t you think?!!"
"...............I wonder if Battler will get caught by that move again.
 I must do my part too, and light a fire under Battler to never feel sympathy for her again.
 ......Although Ange\'s mincemeat seems to have done that pretty well for the time being."
"A power‐up from an Ange‐flavored hamburger?
 Oh‐hoho{0}ho{0}ho{0}ho{0}hoho!
 Of course, I won\'t be beaten either.
 I\'ll be giving Beato my full support so she can make enough of a comeback to compete with Battler."
"......She won\'t lose. Beato.
 I mean, I\'ve threatened her with a wonderful penalty if she does{p:0:♪}"
"..................Your penalties are genuinely no joke, so you should go a little easy."
"I\'ve decided what to do next time I get to give you a penalty, Bern.
 Wanna hear? Wanna hear?"
"No."
"Come o~~n, listen{p:0:☆}
 Okay, here we go, here we go.
 I\'ll lock you in a wonderful, wonderful castle."
"The castle will be surrounded by pure white castle walls, {nobr:12 km} to a side.
 With a height of {nobr:10 m}.
 No magic and no cheating allowed!
 That\'s really not something you can jump over, right?"
"1,440,000,000 m³?
 .........You can stop there, I already know what you\'re going to say."
"Eheheheheh!
 And that place will start getting buried with gems, one every day!
 And I\'ll lock you in it until the castle walls are packed with them, and you\'ve been buried to death with gems.
 Isn\'t that a wonderful, romantic penalty?"
"..................I\'ll let you multiply the length of the walls by five if you make the height one‐tenth its current height, and you can even shut me in it right now."
"Really?!
 That would make it {nobr:3,600,000,000 m³}, you know?!
 The penalty would take more than twice as long!
 Aaahh, you\'ll be my prisoner for such a long time?!
 I love you Bern, I really love yo~u{p:0:♪}"
{f:5:Lambdadelta} playfully clung to {f:5:Bernkastel}, who yawned, looking bored, as she stroked {f:5:Lambdadelta} under the chin as though playing with a cat...
"So you\'re betting on Battler to win.
 And I\'m betting on the two of them getting draws forever.
 ............Isn\'t anyone going to bet on Beato to win?"
".....................It won\'t be me.
 Her chances of winning are zero."
"Oh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho!
 It must hurt to be told by the Witch of Miracles that there\'s zero chance of a miracle!
 I wouldn\'t bet on her either, of course.
 For certain!"
".........It must hurt to be told by the Witch of Certainty that it\'s certainly no good, as well."
Unusually for them, they giggled together...
"I wonder what kind of conclusion this game\'s gonna have...?"
"...............Now that, at least, we can\'t predict.
 ...That\'s why it\'s fun, after all."
"I won\'t allow any more escaping or suspending the game.
 I\'ll make them continue the game for certain, and I won\'t let them run away...!
 I can\'t even imagine how things are gonna unfold now,
 but I do know one way it\'s certainly not going to end."
"..................At the very least, we know it won\'t end with Beato\'s victory."
"I mean, think about it.
 Neither you nor I...
are betting on Beato to come out the winner!
 Which means, if it looks like Beato is gonna win, she\'ll be making enemies of both of us Great Witches...!"
".........Pretty much.
 Our powers are most in balance only when things are somewhere between a draw and Battler\'s advantage.
 If it tips too much in Beato\'s favor, both of us will align along the same vector, and drag Beato back."
"So the instant Beato finds herself on top, ......she\'ll have both of us as enemies to deal with.
 .........Ehheheheheh!
 A common front with Bern, sounds fu~~n{p:0:♪}"
".........Thanks.
 ......But I\'m not taking a konpeitou candy bath with you."
"Aaa~w, but I thought we could take a konpeitou shower together,
 while I cover you all over with melted marshmallows..."
".........That poor girl.
 She\'s a living toy, a doll that you caught so that you could play with me."
"I\'m good at playing with dolls.
 ......I really can play with them well, you know?
 I\'m proud of being able to get hundreds of years of playtime out of a single toy without getting tired of it."
"............You\'re her ally at some times, and oppose her at others,
 toying with her forever.
 ......I feel sorry for her. That kid is our doll, now."
"Ehheheh, that\'s right, that kid is our doll.
 No end is prepared for her except the ones the two of us wish for."
"So I can say for sure that this can only end with either an eternal draw because of me,
 or Beato being defeated and destroyed because of you.
 ............Heheh, ...as far as this game ending with Beato\'s victory goes..."
"...............I will proclaim it as the Witch of Miracles."
"Then I\'ll proclaim it as the Witch of Certainty."
""Beato certainly cannot win.
 And there will be absolutely no miracles.""
""Ahhahahahahahahahahahahaha......!!""
