.........All of the pieces from the game board were gathered.
All of the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s, furniture, witches, and the witches on an even higher level...
...had gathered in one place.
That place was like a solemn cathedral, with an unbelievably high ceiling.
White stonework.
 Golden ornaments.
Though there were windows, there were no entrances nor exits.
{n}It was a strange, strange place.
But for some reason, no one wondered where this strange place was.
......Because they were not given the right to think of this place as strange.
"Pieces.
 Are you all gathered?"
"All present, ma\'am."
"Good work.
 ......What a spectacle.
 I wonder just how many people there are here."
"............No matter how many we see, every being outside the 18 is an illusion."
"Making you acknowledge them is what my game\'s all about.
 *cackle*cackle*!"
The three witches were seated on special thrones set upon a very high balcony.
In the center sat the Game Master, {f:5:Lambdadelta},
 and on either side of the semicircular balcony sat {f:5:Bernkastel} and {f:5:Beatrice}, facing each other.
Below them, Erika ran forward, lifted the corners of her skirt and bowed respectfully.
"Great Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}, I thank you for granting my request for an assembly.
 ......And Great Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}, my master.
 You can expect great things from this assembly.
 Though it may be only for a short while, I will most certainly make you forget about the poison that torments you."
"Yes, great things are what I expect.
 .........Because you are my double,
 and my piece."
Erika and {f:5:Bernkastel} exchanged nasty smiles that would make anyone want to avert their gaze.
"Hear me, witches, {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s!!
 I hereby announce the assembly of a witches\' coven! The Court of Illusions is now in session!!"
The ruler of the game spoke with words of power.
Though her words were spoken inside such a vast space,
 they rang out with the force of a bell in a bell tower...
"Your lives and roles within this game are over!
 The fifth game is hereby closed, and the 24:00 answer session shall begin!
 ......I\'d love to get started right away, but why don\'t we have everyone quickly introduce themselves first?
 Since there\'s so many of us here."
"Eheheheheh!
 I am {f:5:Lambdadelta}!
 The Witch of Certainty and the new ruler of this game!"
".........{f:5:Bernkastel}.
 Witch of Miracles.
 ......My goal is to penetrate {f:5:Beatrice}\'s witch illusions."
"I am the Endless Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}.
 My goals are to assert my own existence and to protect Natsuhi and Kinzo."
"................................."
"......Battler‐sama.
 You come next in rank."
".........I\'m Ushiromiya Battler.
 I\'m fighting Beato\'s—no.........I\'m fighting the witches.
 ......That\'s all."
"As I believe you know, you joined in on this game partway through.
 This means that at the time the coven commenced, you were not yet a participant.
 Do I need to explain further...?"
"I get it.
 ......You mean I don\'t have the right to speak for the time being, right?"
"Thank you for understanding."
Even though Battler held a rank second only to the witches,
 he sat on the foremost pew with the other relatives, all by himself at one end.
He met the gaze of Beato, who was up on the balcony.
"You could simply have said you were my arch‐enemy."
".........Well, you aren\'t necessarily my only enemy."
"Hmph...
 .........Let\'s take this game back.
 It belongs to us."
".....................Yeah."
I almost said that I was fighting Beato\'s witch illusions.
{n}............Originally, Beato was my one and only enemy.
But now, ......Erika and those witches who started tampering with Beato\'s tale...
...are my enemies as well.
Who should I fight and how?
{n}Maybe it\'s a good thing I won\'t have the right to speak for a while.
I\'ll keep a cool head and calmly watch everything unfold......
"I am the detective and the initiator of this coven, Furudo Erika.
 I will expose the culprit of the fifth game and bring this tale to a pleasing conclusion."
Erika greeted the witches above her and the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s behind her once again.
"I\'m looking forward to your performance too.
 Okay, remaining pieces, introduce yourselves in whatever order, and make it quick."
"{y:0:Human}{n:0:Human}s!
 Introduce yourselves, all of you...!"
Urged by 45 to introduce himself, Kinzo stood up.
"......I am Ushiromiya Kinzo.
 I slipped out of the study window and am hiding somewhere on Rokkenjima."
"Ushiromiya Krauss.
 I have been captured and am currently being confined somewhere."
"I\'m Ushiromiya Eva.
 I\'m alive."
"I\'m Rudolf.
 ......The rest of us are all Ushiromiya too, so let\'s just skip the family name."
"I\'m Ushiro—......Rosa.
 I was killed on the first twilight."
"Jessica.
 Same here, dead on the first twilight."
"I\'m George.
 ......Likewise, I died on the first twilight."
"Maria.
 I died, but look, I\'m here talking.
 See?
 Dying isn\'t a big deal, right?
 Kihihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihihi..."
"I\'m Ushiromiya Natsuhi.
 ......I am alive."
"............Eheheheheheheheh."
"..................kh..."
"Hideyoshi here.
 I was killed just a short while ago."
"Kyrie.
 I\'m still alive."
"Nanjo......
 I am also hanging in there..."
"My name is Genji.
 .........I died on the first twilight."
"I\'m Shannon.
 ......I\'m still alive."
"I\'m Kanon.
 I\'m also alive."
"I, I\'m Gohda.
 Pleased to meet you, everyone......"
"I am Kumasawa...
 Pleased to meet you......"
"Now, on to the witches!
 Everyone, introduce yourselves!"
{f:5:Virgilia}\'s group could also be seen.
There was a second balcony, different from the one Beato\'s group was on, which jutted out like raised audience seating.
 They sat there, looking down as though they were at a theater...
".........My name is {f:5:Virgilia}.
 I am {f:5:Beatrice}\'s master in magic."
"I\'m Gaap.
 Making corpses disappear is my job."
"Ronove.
 I am charged with making the tea.
 Pu ku ku..."
"I greet you in the name of the Seven Sisters of Purgatory.
 I served in the murder of Hideyoshi on the second twilight."
""""""The Seven Sisters of Purgatory, right here!""""""
"Let us then have Lady Erika\'s furniture introduce themselves."
"Gertrude.
 I am an Assistant Inquisitor."
"Cornelia.
 I am an Assistant Inquisitor."
The two of them could also be seen on the second‐floor balcony.
{n}They sat apart from {f:5:Virgilia}\'s group.
Then, ......Dlanor, who was seated between the two, slowly stood up.
She had a presence and dignity about her, as though she was overseeing everything from that place.
"Dlanor A. Knox is my {f:5:name}.
 .........I am Lady Erika\'s primary {f:5:assistant}."
"........................"
"Battler.
 I am expecting a lot of {f:5:you}.
 Please do not disappoint {f:5:me}."
"......Let\'s just both give it all we\'ve got."
"Most of the time, there will be no need for Dlanor to step forward.
 However, when the witch side plays around with ugly word games, I\'ll need to have Dlanor pass judgment on them.
 ......The miracle in the study will not occur again."
"..........................."
"And finally, let us introduce ourselves.
 We are the Chiester Sisters Imperial Guards, who have been tasked with management of proceedings at this coven."
"H‐hello, everyone...!!"
"Nyeh nyeh{p:0:♪}"
"This ends the introductions of all pieces.
 A total of 38 people are present here!"
The number of characters was 38 if you only took the fifth game into account,
 but if you added all the pieces who appeared in previous games too, it would probably rise even higher.
This mysterious game, which had so often been likened to chess, now had far more pieces than a chessboard.
"Good.
 Then I guess we\'ll get started.
 Initiator, please begin!
 ......Oh, excuse me, you, the goat over there.
 Refill my drink."
"......And some popcorn for me."
"Oh, that\'s right.
 .........It {i:was} you who decided that popcorn was the only proper accompaniment to demonic theater, after all."
"Yes, I intend to enjoy this.
 .........And could I get some black tea and mustard miso?
 Erika, begin.
 I\'m already starting to get bored."
"Yes, my master, leave it to me...!!
 Order!! Silence!"
At the sound of her voice, the Chiester Sisters troops straightened up, lifted their right knees, and stamped down hard on the floor with their heels.
It became a low, deep rumble in the ground, which instantly erased all chatter in the cathedral...
and turned their eyes and expressions even more hollow and empty.
......The room fell back into silence, almost as though they were a collection of wax models...
Amidst this heavy silence, there was the sound of footsteps...
as Erika walked out into the center where she could catch everyone\'s attention.
When she signaled with her chin, a goat attendant appeared from behind a pillar,
 .........and carried a single, plain chair out into the front and center of the room.
It must have been......the defendant\'s chair.
"I, Furudo Erika, will make an accusation.
 The murderer of the fifth game is—"
"Ushiromiya Natsuhi‐san.
 You are the culprit."
Erika pointed at Natsuhi and spoke......
The Natsuhi wax doll alone...twitched and regained its expression.
{n}......It was an expression of panic.
"Chiester Sisters.
 Please take the defendant to her chair."
"Understood."
"Wait, ......what are you doing?!!
 Let go of me!!"
45 and 410 pinned Natsuhi\'s arms behind her back...
and led her to the chair in the center.
Natsuhi resisted, but the Chiester Sisters were surprisingly strong, and she couldn\'t do anything.
She turned to the relatives for help, but they just remained silent like wax models...
"I, Furudo Erika,
 will now reconstruct why the crime was only possible for Ushiromiya Natsuhi."
".........Beato.
 Of course, you\'ll be defending her, right?"
"Naturally.
 I am the Ushiromiya family alchemist, {f:5:Beatrice} the Golden.
 ......Furudo Erika, I accept your challenge.
 I shall take these false accusations you\'re trying to place on my master...
and tear them apart!!"
"B‐...{f:5:Beatrice}......!"
"Fear not, Natsuhi.
 You are my master.
 And you are the true head, with the One‐winged Eagle engraved in your heart.
 Do not fear a crime you have not committed."
At those words, Natsuhi jerked back, ......and gulped.
{n}Her panic finally disappeared, and she stood up straight.
"...Th‐that\'s true...!
 I am Ushiromiya Natsuhi!
 I will confront any challenger who would dare blaspheme the name of Ushiromiya!"
".........*giggle*.
 How can you make such an empty boast in a situation like this?
 ......You really are the bullied kid in every single fragment."
"So, Bern.
 Make your claims."
"I, {f:5:Bernkastel}, claim...
...that a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}, Ushiromiya Natsuhi, is the culprit of this game."
"And you too Beato, okay?"
"I, {f:5:Beatrice}, claim...
that the culprit in this game is not {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}!
 I am the culprit!"
{f:5:Bernkastel}, who smiled daringly, and {f:5:Beatrice}, who smiled firmly, crossed gazes.
"Do you hear this, witches, {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s?!
 Two claims have appeared for a single truth!
 Is the culprit the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} Ushiromiya Natsuhi?
 Or is the culprit the witch {f:5:Beatrice}?!"
"If the witch wins, the truth of the fifth game will disappear into darkness.
 If Erika wins, the witch illusion will be wiped from the game board.
 ......In other words, for Beato alone, this is a battle where losing is not an option. Are you prepared?"
"And what am I supposed to be preparing myself for?
 This is what I\'ve been craving all along...!"
......If Erika were to win, the witch illusion would be destroyed.
That would mean the existence of the witch would be denied.
{n}Beato was fighting for her life.
However, this wasn\'t the only time she had been fighting for her life.
{n}.........It had always been a life‐or‐death struggle, even when she fought with Battler.
...Because if Battler had won and broken through the witch illusion in any of the previous games,
 Beato would have been destroyed.
"......That\'s dirty.
 Erika\'s the only one with nothing to lose if she fails."
"I wouldn\'t be so certain of that.
 ......Lady {f:5:Bernkastel} is not a compassionate person.
 ......I can\'t imagine she\'d give any warm treatment to a piece that didn\'t perform as she had hoped..."
It was inconceivable that the ruthless {f:5:Bernkastel} would place no blame at all on a piece who had suffered defeat.
......Erika was probably fighting for her life just the same.
The two claims would clash, and one would be weeded out.
One would fall...and would not leave this place alive......
The only ones who truly had nothing to lose......were those witches.
"OK, no problems!
 Now begin!!"
".........In that case,
 I would like to go first.
 The murder of Hideyoshi‐san is very simple.
 It should be impossible to suspect anyone other than Natsuhi‐san.
 Except for the victim and Natsuhi‐san, all of us were in the same room, correct?"
It really was simple.
......Everyone except Natsuhi was in the parlor.
{n}And because it was so simple, it was decisive......
"......No matter how you look at it, the one who killed Hideyoshi was Natsuhi.
 No, it\'s the other way around.
 ......No matter how you look at it, no one except for Natsuhi could have killed Hideyoshi.
 There\'s no room for discussion or debate."
"I, I\'m telling you, you\'re mistaken...!!
 It may be true that I don\'t have an alibi.
 However, I don\'t believe a lack of an alibi proves that one is the culprit...!"
"Hmph, I understand that Natsuhi is the only one without an alibi.
 But wait.
 The scene of the murder was a locked room.
 It should have been impossible for anyone, including Natsuhi, to have committed the crime in that room.
 Except for me, since I could have done it with magic."
"I\'ll explain the locked room trick—the howdunit—later.
 We are starting with the whodunit for the time being.
 ......So for the reason I just mentioned, it\'s impossible to suspect any character except Natsuhi‐san for the murder of Hideyoshi‐san."
".........Milady.
 It may be dangerous to press any further on this."
"I agree.
 It\'s a fact that Natsuhi was hiding in the closet of Hideyoshi\'s room.
 ......If they use a repetition request to check her location, we\'ll be cornered."
"......Probably.
 Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta} is the ruler of this game.
 ......If it suits her fancy, she\'ll set up Natsuhi as the culprit regardless of the facts."
If the typhoon were to pass and the police were to come and perform a scientific investigation,
 perhaps the true culprit {i:would} be identified and the false accusations against Natsuhi lifted.
However, the police would never arrive at this closed‐off Rokkenjima.
......In other words, the real truth would never be revealed.
Inside a cat box that will never be opened, false charges that everyone accepts have exactly the same value as the truth.
"Their aim is most likely to use the simple murder of Hideyoshi to give the impression that Natsuhi‐sama is the culprit...
before moving on to the first twilight\'s reconstruction, which has more uncertain elements."
"It\'s not good at all to proceed while under the Game Master\'s suspicion.
 We should take the initiative."
"Indeed.
 ............Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}!
 As you are well aware, a fair number of murders were committed during the fifth game,
 and we are skipping the rather lengthy chunk of time from midnight until the early morning."
"Skipping to Hideyoshi\'s murder...
and stepping backwards and forwards in time will only lead to confusion.
 It is my belief that we should follow events chronologically and in order, though the decision is yours, of course."
"Objection.
 Chronological order has no significance in the process of building a case against the culprit."
"Objection.
 Furudo Erika is trying to manipulate perception in her favor by mixing up the chronological sequence."
"Ugh, I don\'t like it when things get all muddled either.
 I accept Beato\'s claim.
 Erika, start with the first twilight instead of jumping to the second."
"...............Tch."
I definitely saw Erika click her tongue.
......Now I understand.
 This is {i:how the tales of Rokkenjima are created}.
After being guided by {f:5:Virgilia} and meeting {f:5:Beatrice},
 ......now I stand here, at this peak from which I can see everything below me, and I finally understand the truth of this world.
"This is......that thing you talked to me about before."
".........Yes, that\'s right.
 Truth is very fragile in this place."
"As long as each side makes its own claim, different truths can exist at the same time..."
Yes.
 This really is a trial.
{n}Both sides put forth their own truths.
This here truly is the Braun tube trial that {f:5:Virgilia} once used as an analogy......
"Then I will follow Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}\'s orders and start from the first crime at the first twilight.
 As you know, at midnight on October 4th, the first day,
 following a short break in the family conference, Natsuhi‐san left on her own, saying that she was going to bed early.
 Therefore, her alibi is completely lost from that time until the next morning."
"Oh, is that so?
 I believe there are several people besides Natsuhi who have dubious alibis.
 Unless you can clear suspicion from all of them, I cannot allow you to call Natsuhi the culprit."
"True.
 If Erika wants to claim that Natsuhi is suspicious,
 she should first show that everyone besides Natsuhi has an alibi.
 Right, Bern?"
".........Yes, of course.
 Erika will provide a complete explanation that covers everyone."
"Of course, my master...!
 In that case, I would like to explain things in order.
 Let\'s forget about Genji\'s murder for now and focus on the crime in the guesthouse.
 The inclination here is to suspect the servants who were in the guesthouse, yes?
 On that night, Gohda‐san and Kumasawa‐san were in the guesthouse.
 Isn\'t that right, you two?"
She turned to face the direction where those two people were seated, ......and just those two wax models came back to life.
When they weren\'t allowed to speak, they probably weren\'t even granted a soul.
In that case, it would have been much better if Natsuhi\'s soul could simply have disappeared as well...
......Natsuhi, who was in the defendant\'s chair, kept her soul the whole time, and was constantly hanging her head, looking nervous...
Gohda hurried to his feet and answered Erika\'s question.
"Y‐yes, that is correct.
 On that evening, I was alone in the guesthouse servant room..."
"Well, look at my age.
 Staying up the night would be a heavy burden, so I returned to the servants\' quarters in the guesthouse...
and went to bed right away on my own... Yes, you\'d better believe I did...!"
"......Doesn\'t that mean Gohda and Kumasawa have lost their alibis?!!
 Kumasawa claims that she was sleeping alone in the servants\' quarters.
 Gohda claims he was alone in the servant room.
 Either of them should have had enough time to go to the cousins\' room and commit murder!!"
"N‐n‐nonsense...!
 Why would we do something like that...?!"
"That\'s right, that\'s right...!
 How could we ever kill another person...?!"
"Natsuhi said it all.
 Both Kumasawa, who was sleeping alone in the servants\' quarters, and Gohda, who was alone in the servant room,
 are in the exact same situation as Natsuhi in her room.
 Both of them have lost their alibis."
"Have no fear.
 I guarantee that neither of these two are murderers.
 Firstly, Kumasawa‐san—following dinner, she left the mansion with me and the others and went to the guesthouse,
 entered the servants\' quarters, and slept until morning.
 It\'s the same for Gohda‐san.
 Once he finished with his job, he chatted with us in the lounge and went to sleep afterwards.
 Neither of them had the opportunity to commit murder."
"Hmph.
 So, we\'re finally here."
"......I see that it\'s time for me to stand up as well.
 Your turn is over already, Erika.
 ...Go summon that bodyguard you rely on so much."
Beato glanced at where Dlanor sat on the second‐floor balcony.
{n}......However, Dlanor just stared back with those usual expressionless eyes.
"Repetition requested.
 "We have absolute proof of Gohda and Kumasawa\'s alibis"."
"Decline repetition.
 .........Why give a hint to an enemy?
 There\'s no way we\'d answer."
"Hah!
 Did you hear that, Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}?
 They say they have no proof!
 Is it acceptable for them to claim that Gohda and Kumasawa have alibis without proof?!"
"Good point.
 What do you say, Bern, Erika?
 How can you claim that Gohda and Kumasawa have alibis?"
"Stay out of this, Erika.
 My opponent is Dlanor over there.
 A mere {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} like you is not fit to argue with a witch!"
".............................."
"No.
 There\'s no need for Dlanor to step forward.
 .........In fact, it is precisely this, a "mere {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}" defeating a witch, that will spell the end for the witch illusion.
 ......So go ahead.
 Use the red and blue as much as you like.
 ......I\'m ready for you."
In response to Erika\'s challenge, Beato smiled boldly yet gracefully and slowly stood up.
And they glared at each other between the floor and the balcony......
"{p:2:Gohda and Kumasawa have no alibis.
 The two of them were in the guesthouse and could have reached the cousins\' room to commit murder at any time.
 Unless you can eliminate that possibility, you cannot treat Natsuhi as the culprit}."
Beato\'s blue truth struck out rapidly.
{n}The curtain had finally dropped, and the battle had begun......
"......A {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} like Erika can\'t use any red.
 How could she turn this around without calling Dlanor?"
"Though Erika cannot use it, her master, Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}, can.
 ......We mustn\'t let our guards down."
"Blue truth, valid.
 ......What\'ll you do, Bern?
 Will you or Dlanor step in instead?"
"It is still not my {f:5:turn}.
 And it is not Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}\'s turn {f:5:either}."
"......Yes, that\'s right.
 There\'s no need for us to show up for something like this.
 ......This is important precisely because a mere {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} like Furudo Erika will defeat you, Beato."
"......Because you\'ll be defeated by a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}, we\'ll know.
 We\'ll all know that the fake witch who calls herself "{f:5:Beatrice} the Golden" is nothing more than a sub‐{y:0:Human}{n:0:human} illusion."
"*giggle*giggle*...
 If you really can do that, it\'ll be seriously interesting...
 Okay, Erika.
 Let\'s see what you\'ve got...!"
"I will begin with Kumasawa‐san. It is extremely simple.
 Kumasawa‐san, stand."
"Y‐.........yes...!"
"Kumasawa‐san, from the time you went to bed last night...
to the time you were informed about the crime in the morning, did you ever leave the servants\' quarters?"
"No!
 I was sound asleep until morning, I really was!!"
"The truth is...
......after dinner last night, I had a chat with Eva‐san, and she told me something very interesting.
 ...And I tested it out myself."
"What are you talking about...?
 ......You don\'t mean..."
"That\'s right.
 It\'s what cornered and sealed Kinzo in the study.
 ......I learned that you can create a seal by putting something between a door and the frame."
".........Are you kidding...?
 Did she actually......do that to the servants\' quarters where Kumasawa‐san was sleeping?!"
"Erika was in the guesthouse, so there\'s no obstacle to her having been capable of that."
"After all, it was an unsettling night, and a massive amount of gold had just been discovered. Many sorts of crimes might have occurred.
 ......Where there is a detective, there will be a crime.
 I foresaw that some kind of crime would take place,
 so I used this to seal away people whose alibis might otherwise be lost."
Erika held a small, folded piece of brown paper high in the air.
"After I watched Kumasawa‐san, who returned to the guesthouse with me, say goodnight and enter the servants\' quarters,
 I used this to seal the door."
"Then, in the morning,
 when the crime was discovered and caused a big uproar, I immediately went to check Kumasawa‐san\'s quarters,
 where I confirmed that the seal was still intact.
 Therefore, I can prove Kumasawa‐san\'s alibi!"
".........<Good>.
 A wonderful alibi. Absolutely airtight.
 Kumasawa returned to the guesthouse with Erika, went to the servants\' quarters to sleep, and never left the room until morning.
 {p:1:In other words, after Kumasawa returned to the guesthouse, she never went to the second floor until morning}."
The proof Erika had shown was elevated by {f:5:Bernkastel} and became red truth.
This truth, which had become red, could no longer be overturned, even by Beato...
In other words, in that instant, Kumasawa\'s perfect alibi had been absolutely guaranteed.
"Hohoh!
 Then what about Gohda?!"
"Gohda‐san holed up in the servant room right after reaching the guesthouse.
 I sealed him up in the same way.
 Then, when Rosa‐san returned at {nobr:1 a.m.}, I happened to notice her when I stepped out into the corridor.
 I let Gohda‐san, who was still in the servant room, know this."
"The seal was intact at that time, so from the time we arrived at the guesthouse until {nobr:1 a.m.},
 Gohda‐san never left the servant room.
 And afterwards, he was with me in the lounge until {nobr:3 a.m}.
 And after {nobr:3 a.m.}, I was upstairs,
 so I can guarantee that Gohda‐san didn\'t come up."
".........Erika\'s seal proves that Gohda was holed up in the servant room until {nobr:1 a.m}.
 And Erika can testify to his alibi from then until {nobr:3 a.m.},
 because she was passing the time in the lounge with him.
 And after that point, he never set foot upstairs until the morning after.
 Erika can attest to this as well."
"{p:1:In other words, after Gohda returned to the guesthouse, he never went up to the second floor until morning}."
"Red truth, valid.
 ......Well done, Erika.
 The alibis due to your seals on those doors have been acknowledged by Bern and elevated to the status of red truth."
"Thank you very much, my master.
 ......I am the detective! A being greater than {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s, who can invoke the red truth despite her {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}ity!"
"You claim to be greater than {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}......?
 You conceited brat! Live another thousand years, and then you can talk!"
"It\'ll be a pain to have you try anything funny, so I\'ll make this clear now.
 In fact, I should have done this in the beginning.
 I apologize for being so roundabout.
 This is the state of the guesthouse at midnight."
".........The gold had been found, an emergency family conference called, and Battler‐san had gone to the mansion with the relatives.
 I, the three cousins, Doctor Nanjo, Gohda‐san, and Kumasawa‐san remained in the guesthouse."
"I have already explained Gohda‐san and Kumasawa‐san\'s alibis.
 George‐san, Jessica‐san, and Maria‐san were playing cards in the cousins\' room.
 I actually joined in for a little bit, and I clearly witnessed that they were alive at that time."
"My master, I request that you repeat this!!"
"Yes, I\'ll oblige you.
 {p:1:At 24:00 in the guesthouse, George, Jessica, and Maria were alive,
 and they were in the second‐floor cousins\' room.
 Nanjo, Gohda, and Kumasawa were on the first floor}."
"And, since there\'s no need to hold off on it anymore,
 I\'ll confirm that all the victims so far are dead.
 {p:1:George, Jessica, Maria, Rosa, and Genji—these five really are dead}.
 How could they be playing dead with their necks sliced open like that?"
"Thank you for repeating, my master...!
 I had to make these things clear, you see, or I might have started hearing about how they were already dead before I guaranteed everyone\'s alibi,
 or that they weren\'t actually dead at all."
".........gh..."
Unsurprisingly, Beato\'s side couldn\'t get away with the simple plan of claiming that the victims were only playing dead.
But in order to overcome Gohda and Kumasawa\'s alibis, it should have been possible to suppose that the crime occurred before those doors were sealed.
However, the opponent had predicted this move perfectly.
It had now been shown in red that the crime did not occur before the time period covered by Erika\'s alibis.
"Got it.
 That\'s the last time the victims were confirmed to be alive.
 I wish you\'d said that in the beginning.
 ......This means we can ignore everything that happened before midnight."
".........To go even further,
 {p:1:at 24:00, Natsuhi, Krauss, and Genji were in a corridor on the second floor of the mansion.
 All the remaining people were at the family conference in the dining hall.
 Of course, at that point in time, no murder had occurred.
 Genji was also alive}."
"That isn\'t something that Erika observed,
 but we can\'t move the game forward without establishing it.
 Okay, I\'ll acknowledge that red truth."
"Thank you very much for that red truth, my master!"
Since Erika had been in the guesthouse,
 it was only natural that she could explain the situation there.
However, since she hadn\'t been in the mansion at the time,
 explaining the situation over there would have been extremely difficult for her.
......Beato would normally have attacked there with the blue truth,
 saying that the people in the dining hall had all agreed to keep to the same story,
 and that someone might have snuck out of the dining hall and committed murder in the guesthouse.
However, because Bern had instantly settled that matter with the red truth,
 Beato had completely lost her chance to strike back......
"Damn you............"
"......Very troublesome.
 ......To think we would be put at such a disadvantage..."
"This is almost the exact opposite of Riiche\'s fights with Battler......"
"......In fact, the situation might be even worse than it was back then."
At a glance, the fight between the two of them resembled our previous fights.
However, there were some vital differences.
The first was whether or not Beato was the Game Master.
The Beato who fought against me was the Game Master.
{n}So she knew all the truth.
That\'s why she was able to use the red truth at will.
However, the current Beato isn\'t the Game Master.
{n}She\'s just a single piece on the game board.
......In other words, even Beato doesn\'t know the truth.
So you could say that Beato is now in the same position I once was.
Also, though Erika may seem to be in the same position I once was,
 the situation for her is totally different.
She\'s connected to the witch called {f:5:Bernkastel}.
......Even though she isn\'t the Game Master, she\'s capable of elevating Erika\'s statements to become red truth.
Because of this, Erika can use the red truth even though she\'s neither a witch nor the Game Master.
Beato, who\'s supposed to be the witch, possesses no truth or red she can use.
{n}And yet the detective, Erika, can use the red truth.
The advantage has completely flipped over to the other side.
......You could probably say that the current Beato is in a much worse position than I was when I fought with her.
After I got used to the game, Beato stopped responding to my repetition requests,
 but in the beginning, she responded to almost all of them, giving me quite a few hints.
That\'s why we were able to fight on par.
However, {f:5:Bernkastel} is different.
She fully understands the rules of this game, and is prepared to corner Beato without even a hint of restraint.
.........And all this made me realize.
......Beato was going easy on me so that we could fight on par with each other......
"*cackle*cackle*cackle*......
 This has become quite an interesting fight.
 ...I see, so I must fight from the position Battler once stood in."
".........Beato......"
"I once insulted you and called you incompetent.
 ......I can handle much, much worse than this. *cackle*cackle*!"
"It\'s now impossible to suspect Gohda and Kumasawa.
 You can\'t win by arguing that point any longer."
"Yep.
 Let\'s switch to a different approach."
"The next in line would probably be Nanjo.
 He was also in the guesthouse."
"Nanjo was in the lounge with Erika, if I\'m not mistaken.
 ......But the time periods before and after that should be wide open."
"That\'s right, I\'ll strike there.
 ......Nanjo.
 You were relaxing in the downstairs lounge of the guesthouse with Erika and Gohda, correct?"
"Yes......
 I was with Erika‐san the whole time..."
"And during what time was this?"
"F‐from 1 to {nobr:3 a.m}."
"Yes, that\'s right.
 Between {nobr:1 a.m.} and {nobr:3 a.m},
 Doctor Nanjo, Gohda‐san, and I were relaxing in the lounge.
 ......Repetition requested, my master!"
"I\'ll respond.
 {p:1:From {nobr:1 a.m.} to {nobr:3 a.m.}, the trio of Erika, Nanjo, and Gohda...
spent their time in the lounge on the first floor of the guesthouse}."
......Though she had flat out refused Beato\'s repetition request, she responded to Erika\'s immediately.
The red truth...was starting to corner Beato.
......Beato grimaced as though in pain, but she still struck back with the blue truth.
......No, she really was in pain.
As alibis were steadily established for everyone other than Natsuhi, the witch illusion was also being denied.
Beato perceived the denial of her existence as pain...
"{p:2:Even so, he shouldn\'t have an alibi for the time period before and after you were in the lounge!
 It was possible for Nanjo to commit the crime too}!"
"That\'s right.
 I get that Nanjo was in the lounge with Erika from {nobr:1 a.m.} to {nobr:3 a.m.}, but what about before and after that?
 ......Well, Erika?"
"Of course.
 First, the alibi for before {nobr:1 a.m}.
 This is no problem at all.
 I played cards with the cousins in their room until midnight,
 and then went downstairs to the lounge, where I met Doctor Nanjo."
"That\'s right......
 At midnight, I met Erika‐san as she was coming down the stairs, and spoke with her, learning that she was quite the connoisseur of the mystery genre.
 I realized that I\'d found a kindred spirit......"
"When I went into the archive to solve the epitaph\'s riddle,
 I noticed that there were several original copies of famous foreign mystery novels stored there.
 So, I wanted to discuss them with the actual books in hand.
 We moved to the archive and were talking the whole time.
 Constantly, until we moved to the lounge."
The archive in the guesthouse had enough books in it that you might even call it a small library.
In it were several famous foreign mystery novels...
that Kinzo had once taken a liking to.
Of course, they were all originals and in English, but English was no problem for both Erika and Nanjo.
On that occasion, Erika had again borrowed the key to the archive from Gohda in the servant room.
She added that she had rechecked the seal at that point and, of course, reset it.
Damn her.
Even though she keeps it sealed for anyone else to enter or leave, she alone enters and leaves whenever she wants.
"I see.
 So, from midnight until {nobr:3 a.m.} when you went to bed, you were with Nanjo the whole time?
 That means Nanjo\'s alibi is the most rock solid of them all."
"Yes, that is indeed the case!
 Repetition requested, my master...!"
"I\'ll respond.
 {p:1:After 24:00, Erika was with Nanjo the whole time until {nobr:3 a.m}}."
At midnight, the crime in the cousins\' room still hadn\'t occurred.
So this establishes an alibi for the period before the time he spent in the lounge.
"After that, we walked out of the archive and into the hallway at {nobr:1 a.m}.
 When we did, we just happened to bump into Rosa‐san as she returned.
 I then told Gohda‐san about that.
 ......I figured it was probably a servant\'s responsibility to welcome in a guest."
Gohda asked if he should bring a towel, but Rosa refused.
She quickly headed up to the second floor.
At this point, Erika, Gohda, and Nanjo gathered together and decided to have a drink......
Their alibis in the lounge up until {nobr:3 a.m.} have already been proclaimed in red, so there are no problems there.
"Let\'s continue on to after {nobr:3 a.m}.
 This is Doctor Nanjo\'s alibi after we split up.
 At {nobr:3 a.m.}, Battler‐san returned and the people in the lounge went their separate ways.
 Doctor Nanjo, Battler‐san and I went up to the second floor.
 I then said good night to Doctor Nanjo.
 At this time, of course, I put a seal on the door to the doctor\'s room as well."
"And it went unchanged until the crime was discovered.
 I flew out of my room the moment Battler‐san screamed,
 and I confirmed that the door to Doctor Nanjo\'s room was still sealed.
 Therefore, Doctor Nanjo\'s alibi is perfect both before {nobr:1 a.m.} and after {nobr:3 a.m}...!"
"Splendid, Erika.
 {p:1:Both your seal and your red truth are perfect.
 Nanjo had the alibi of being with Erika until {nobr:3 a.m}.
 And he didn\'t leave his room after {nobr:3 a.m.} until morning}."
Using the seals she had placed on the doors,
 Erika was granted red truths from {f:5:Bernkastel} one after another......
When I gave Beato a repetition request, it was about maneuvering and tactics,
 ......but it\'s totally different for Erika.
For her, it\'s like having a trump card which can make red whenever she wants......
"This concludes the proof of alibis for all suspects in the guesthouse.
 ......No problems, I assume?"
"I, ......I do have a problem...!!
 And that problem is, ......umm........."
Beato racked her brains to find some point to latch onto, but Erika\'s red had been ruthlessly perfect.
......There was no point she could take issue with...
Beato kept thinking hard, trying to fault Erika on something,
 but her expression was so wrought with desperation that anyone could tell by looking...
"I\'m overruling you, Beato.
 I can\'t sense any problems at all.
 ......It\'s totally <pop>, <cute>, and <perfect>!
 The alibis for all humans in the guesthouse have now been proven."
"......Hold it, Erika.
 You\'re gonna leave me out of this?
 I\'m pretty sure Ushiromiya Battler also had a chance to commit the crime.
 ......After all, I was in the same room as the victims all night.
 There\'s no way I\'ll let you carry on this discussion while ignoring me.
 ......?!"
At that moment, an arrow twisted like a golden snake and hit me.
It didn\'t pierce through me, but it slapped me hard on the cheek like a whip.
"Battler‐sama, your right to speak has not yet been recognized.
 Be warned."
"......Oooww... Dammit......"
"Yeah, I understand, Battler.
 ......And my apologies. Forgive me.
 ......Erika!
 You still haven\'t shown an alibi for Battler!
 Battler is the man who was sleeping alongside the victims.
 Shouldn\'t he be placed under the greatest suspicion of all?!"
"Beato\'s right.
 You can\'t go skipping Battler like that."
"My apologies.
 I had completely forgotten about him."
"After Battler returned at {nobr:3 a.m.}, you went upstairs with him.
 And I believe you also went to your own room and slept.
 You may have gone to the cousins\' room at midnight, but I don\'t think you went there after {nobr:3 a.m}."
"......Will you now claim that you went to crawl into Battler\'s bed later on?
 *cackle*cackle*!
 Of course, if you tell me you were looking at Battler\'s sleeping face all night long to confirm his alibi in the cousins\' room,
 I might just be willing to accept your proof...!"
"Yes. I listened to him breathing in his sleep all night long. Got a problem with that?"
"......What......?!"
"I, Furudo Erika, can prove that Battler‐san returned to the cousins\' room at {nobr:3 a.m.},
 that he went straight to bed afterwards, and that he went straight to sleep.
 And I can prove that until he woke up, noticed the gruesome situation the room was in, and let out a scream, nothing happened in that room."
"So you have no need to worry.
 Battler‐san isn\'t the culprit.
 He\'s just the charming first discoverer who entered the murder scene without realizing it was one and slept until morning."
"That\'s insane...
 Even with those seals you love so much, it shouldn\'t be possible for you to prove that...!
 How can you prove this?!!"
".........It\'s a load of crap.
 I entered that room alone.
 And Erika must have gone into her own room as well.
 How can she say something like that, as though she saw the whole thing...?!"
"She never said that she saw it.
 ......The room Erika was assigned to—where was it located?"
"Erika, tell me, please.
 How can you prove so much about Battler?"
".........*giggle*giggle*.
 I\'d expect no less from a true detective......"
"My room was right next to the cousins\' room.
 There was only a single thin wall between them."
"Y‐
......you don\'t mean......
 ......You...put your ear against the wall...
...to check what was happening in the cousins\' room...?"
"Yes.
 My ears are perfect.
 Right after Battler‐san entered the room, I put my ear against the wall and listened carefully to make sure nothing out of the ordinary occurred."
"......You said you could prove that nothing happened until Battler let out a scream the next morning...
 ......You don\'t mean..."
"Yes.
 I put my ear against the wall and listened in on that room until morning, without sleeping a wink."
...............Everyone...
was stunned into silence.........
She put her ear against the wall...
...and for the entire time until morning...
.....she listened to what was going on in Battler\'s room......
Just what would that have looked like......
Until dawn, she had silenced her breathing in a pitch‐black room,
 clinging to the wall shared with the cousins\' room......
Like some kind of creepy venomous spider clinging to the wall of a darkened room......
{f:5:Bernkastel} alone was grinning in triumph.
"......Due to the progression of the game, I realized that Battler, the one who had received the Head\'s Ring, would be a key player.
 ......I was sure that Battler would be a victim of the first twilight."
"Yes.
 So, just as my master told me to do,
 ......I put my ear against the wall until morning without a wink of sleep, checking to make sure nothing unusual happened...!"
"Erika has a photographic memory.
 And her hearing ability is on par with a tape recorder.
 ......It would have been impossible for Battler to kill George and the others and slit their throats without Erika hearing it."
"......It\'s an accepted power of the detective\'s authority.
 I have no choice but to acknowledge it.
 I\'ll confirm it in red...!
 {p:1:Ushiromiya Battler returned to the cousins\' room at {nobr:3 a.m.} and fell asleep.
 After that, until the discovery of the crime, absolutely nothing out of the ordinary happened in the room}!"
"{p:1:In other words, it was impossible for Battler to commit murder or damage the corpses}."
".........nn...
...ggghh........."
The red from the two of them forced Beato to show an expression of considerable anguish...
It was only natural.
The red truth they had spoken not only guaranteed Battler\'s alibi, but a number of other things as well.
First off, it meant the murder was impossible for {i:anyone} after {nobr:3 a.m}.
And since the cousins were confirmed to be alive as late as midnight, the time period of the crime automatically became...
“between midnight and three o\'clock”.
That also automatically provided a guaranteed alibi...
for everyone who wasn\'t in the guesthouse before {nobr:3 a.m.}
".........That one hurts...
...a lot........."
"After midnight, Erika was in the guesthouse the whole time.
 So, it should have been difficult for her to prove alibis for all of the people in the mansion..."
"It should have been almost impossible to prove alibis for Eva and the others.
 ...But now, all she has to do is prove that they never visited the guesthouse between midnight and {nobr:3 a.m.},
 and she can prove those alibis..."
"......Anyway, we\'ll have to construct it so that the murders were possible before {nobr:3 a.m}.
 And we have to prove that it was possible for one of the people in the mansion to do it...!"
The people who were in the guesthouse all had alibis.
{n}The crime didn\'t occur before midnight.
{n}The crime couldn\'t have occurred after three o\'clock.
In other words, there was no way for the murders to happen unless someone from the mansion committed the crime between midnight and three o\'clock......
In order to protect Natsuhi, she had to establish that it was possible for someone other than Natsuhi to commit the crime.
Ironically, the witch had to prove that a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} could have committed the crime...
"............Still, that\'s a tall order.
 ......Until {nobr:3 a.m.}, Erika was in the lounge.
 And you have to pass through there to get upstairs.
 In other words, she\'s practically like a sentry for the upstairs floor of the guesthouse."
"......This is an unimaginative suggestion, but if it was possible to reach the upper floor without Erika noticing,
 we would probably be able to prove that the crime was possible for anyone."
"It\'s probably possible for a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} to climb up to the second‐story windows if they really wanted to."
Of course, Beato had also thought of striking back that way.
......And {f:5:Bernkastel} must have thought this as well.
"Battler, Nanjo, Gohda, Kumasawa.
 We realize that the crime was impossible for all these people in the guesthouse.
 ......However, what about the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s in the mansion?!"
"As I have already said, and as my master has even proclaimed with the red truth,
 I was in the lounge on the first floor of the guesthouse.
 And to reach the second floor, one must pass through the lounge.
 In other words, it was impossible to reach the second floor without me seeing it."
"And what if that wasn\'t impossible?
 {p:2:For example, what if someone placed a ladder against the outer wall of the guesthouse and snuck in through a second‐story window?!
 There must be a way to reach the second floor without passing through the lounge!
 If this is the case, it would be possible to reach the crime scene without you seeing it}...!"
Beato finally struck back.
Before now, she had let Erika take total control and attack her with the red over and over.
During that time, Beato\'s counterattacks with the blue truth had been few in number, even including this one...
"Of course, I knew you\'d try saying that.
 I can\'t have my lookout in the lounge become meaningless.
 So first, I must prove that my lookout was perfect."
"......Firstly, because of how the guesthouse is constructed,
 it is impossible to reach the second floor without me seeing it from the lounge.
 There are no places under cover, and neither are there any physical or mental blind spots.
 ......My master, I request you repeat!"
"{p:1:It is impossible for someone to reach the second floor of the guesthouse without anyone in the lounge noticing it.
 ......Though of course, this only refers to reaching the second floor from inside the building}."
"<Good>, my master!
 ......So, next is Lady {f:5:Beatrice}\'s theory that there might be a way to reach the second floor from the outside.
 This really does pose a problem.
 After all, there are trees that could probably be climbed, and someone could have used a ladder.
 We also can\'t be certain that crawling up the rain gutter would be impossible.
 But I {i:can\'t let you do that}."
"Hoh, you won\'t let me...?
 And how\'s that?
 Did you stay up all night circling the guesthouse?
 No, you couldn\'t do that, could you?
 You were in the lounge...!
 From the lounge, you can only see a small part of the outer perimeter through the window!"
"That\'s true.
 I couldn\'t prevent all methods of climbing up to the second floor from the outside.
 ......However, I was able to prevent all entry from the second floor."
"Prevent...entry...?!"
"......I had already foreseen this move.
 ......Frightening......and so persistent...!"
"Because of how the guesthouse is constructed, the only method of entry from the second floor is the windows."
"The locks? They don\'t matter at all.
 I only had to prove that none of the windows or shutters were opened even once."
"After I witnessed the location of the hidden gold, I returned to the guesthouse...
and immediately began severing all methods of entry to the second floor that didn\'t pass through the lounge.
 .........Yes, it\'s exactly the same.
 No different from the rest...!"
"......Don\'t tell me...
you used that seal of yours......on all the windows of the guesthouse......?
 In that weather, ......dressed like that...?"
"Well, I did have my swimsuit from when I drifted here."
".........She\'s insane......
 ...At a house where she was welcomed as a guest, before anything had happened at all, she went out in all that rain,
 and did something like that......?"
"For a normal {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}, it would certainly be an impossibly dubious action.
 ......However, she is the witch\'s piece."
In the middle of all that rain,
 Erika sealed all the windows from the outside...
...to create an alibi showing that no one could have snuck into the guesthouse from the outside.
She climbed up the walls herself, ......and did that to all the windows on the first and second floor.
{n}No, to all things which could possibly have permitted entry.
After hearing that she\'d listened to the cousins\' room all night long without sleeping a wink,
 even this bizarre behavior didn\'t seem quite so impossible......
That had probably also......looked like a venomous spider.
A repulsive venomous spider crawling eerily over the outer walls of the guesthouse in the middle of a storm......
".........You...
 ......Just what do you think...
...of the house of Ushiromiya...?
 Is this how you repay us for welcoming you as a guest...?!"
"To the detective, the Ushiromiya house is nothing more or less than the stage upon which the crime occurs.
 ......Before the outbreak of the crime, it was important for me to memorize the names of the characters, memorize the lay of the land,
 and prepare for the upcoming crime by devoting my time towards collecting and creating all possible alibis."
"From my perspective, detectives who make no preparations before the outbreak of the crime are pretty third‐rate.
 After all, we all know that someone will die wherever we spend the night."
".........Furthermore,
 at the moment the crime was discovered, Erika confirmed that none of those seals had been broken.
 That\'s why Erika wasn\'t the first one to reach the cousins\' room when the corpses were discovered."
"Even without inspecting the corpses, she could be certain of several things thanks to the red truth.
 It was more important to check the seals and construct alibis."
"You are perfect, my master.
 All I did was prove everything to perfection by following your orders...!"
"Well done, Erika.
 My double, my piece...!
 What do you think, Lambda?
 I\'d say this proves that Erika\'s lookout in the lounge contains absolute reliability as far as constructing alibis is concerned..."
"......Yeah, I\'ll acknowledge that.
 Erika, your seal is perfect.
 I\'ll acknowledge it in red.
 {p:1:It was impossible to reach the second floor of the guesthouse without passing through the lounge,
 and impossible to reach it at all without Erika, who was in the lounge, knowing about it}!"
"Thank you very much, Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}...!
 So, you know what\'s coming next, Great Lady {f:5:Beatrice}!
 {p:2:Therefore, the time of the crime is limited to the single hour between midnight, when they were confirmed to be alive,
 and {nobr:1 a.m.}, when our party in the lounge started}!"
"Ug...
...gah...
...ah......"
"I\'ve already said it, but at midnight, I went down to the lounge,
 hit it off with Doctor Nanjo, and was engrossed by a discussion of the mystery genre in the archive until {nobr:1 a.m}."
"......It\'s a bit embarrassing, but I grew so engrossed with this discussion...
that I wouldn\'t have noticed if anyone had passed through the corridor during that period.
 ......Quite a regretful mistake for a detective."
After doing all that maneuvering and setting up seals to guarantee a perfect alibi,
 she became too engrossed in a mystery discussion and left an opening......?
Her relaxed smile was completely shameless, the total opposite of her words.
It almost seems like it\'s the other way around.
It\'s enough to make you think that this is an intentional trap,
 said in full awareness that only Natsuhi doesn\'t have an alibi for the hour following midnight...
"To put it the other way around, this has the following corollary:
 the only ones who could have reached the cousins\' room and committed the crime...are those who have no alibi between midnight and {nobr:1 a.m.}!"
Her eyes clearly hinted that Natsuhi was the only one who fit this description...
......It had been a crime that occurred at a completely unknown point during that long night.
But because of the alibis Erika had constructed,
 that time period had been compressed and restricted to the single hour following midnight.
Erika left the cousins\' room at midnight.
{n}This is the last time we have confirmation that George and the others were alive.
And after the party in the lounge started at {nobr:1 a.m},
 it was impossible to reach the cousins\' room by any method.
"............All this from a mere {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}......"
"This is quite bad...
 The night has been sealed up into an hour, ......and at this rate, there won\'t be many pieces left to suspect..."
"......Damn you, Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}...
 ...Not bad at all........."
"Unlike Battler, I\'m not an idiot.
 ......After this game\'s repeated five times, I have more than enough cards in my hand.
 ......
*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*!!"
"Then let us continue.
 Let\'s examine the alibis of the remaining suspects, the people in the mansion.
 After all, we only have to worry about the single hour between midnight and {nobr:1 a.m}.
 That shouldn\'t be difficult at all."
"First, midnight.
 At this time, Natsuhi, Krauss, and Genji were in the second floor corridor, and all of the others were in the first floor dining hall.
 This has already been given in red truth by my master!"
"Yes, that\'s right.
 {p:1:At 24:00, Natsuhi, Krauss, and Genji were in the corridor on the second floor of the mansion.
 The rest of them were in the dining hall on the first floor}.
 And as you know, there was a mysterious knock, and a letter with the One‐winged seal on it appeared.
 The discussion surrounding that continued on until {nobr:1 a.m}.
 I will say it with the red truth.
 {p:1:Of all the people in the dining hall, not one of them left the dining hall until {nobr:1 a.m.}}...!"
The time that the crime was possible had been limited to between midnight and one o\'clock.
And it had been guaranteed that the adults in the family conference did not leave the mansion between midnight and one o\'clock.
 This gave them all proven alibis.
"......A‐......and how do you intend to prove that?!
 Erika\'s in the guesthouse!
 Did someone prove it by using one of your favorite seals on the dining hall door?!
 You have no convincing evidence or proof...!!"
"{p:1:The red truth is simply truth, and there is no need to provide evidence, proof, or room for a counterargument}!!
 ......You made that rule.
 *cackle*cackle*cackle*giggle*giggle*giggle*ehe{0}he{0}he{0}he{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha...!!"
This overbearing red truth hadn\'t only given alibis to the adults in the dining hall.
It also gave alibis to Shannon and Kanon, who had come to serve tea,
 and even guaranteed that they never left the dining hall.
In other words, ......the only ones who didn\'t have proven alibis......
were three people: Natsuhi, Krauss, and Genji...
No, ......there were only two left.
If alibis were proven for Krauss and Genji,
 it would prove that no one but Natsuhi could have been the culprit...!
"Let\'s move on to Genji.
 He\'s a victim, but we can\'t rule out the possibility that he committed the crime in the cousins\' room and then was killed himself."
"And furthermore, although he was in the second‐floor corridor at midnight,
 he then returned to the servant room to transfer the phone call for Natsuhi and was completely isolated."
"Which means that it was possible for Genji to commit the crime—"
"I\'ll say it in red.
 {p:1:When Genji finished transferring the call, he immediately returned to the servants\' quarters}.
 That\'s just a cold, hard truth, without any evidence, proof, seals or alibis, got it?"
"Then, at {nobr:1 a.m.},
 there was another break in the family conference, and Rosa returned to the guesthouse.
 ......At that time...
 I\'m truly thankful for your cooperation, Ushiromiya Eva‐san.
 Please rise...!"
".........Erika‐chan wasn\'t the only one, you know?
 I was also certain that something would happen that night."
"She\'s the person who taught me how to make those seals.
 And she helped me to check the alibis of those people under suspicion...!"
"During the break at {nobr:1 a.m.},
 I went to Genji‐san\'s quarters and used the same seal as Erika‐chan...!
 In other words, if this wasn\'t broken,
 it would mean that no one could have entered or left that room between {nobr:1 a.m.} and the next morning...!!"
"Now, Kanon‐san and Kumasawa‐san.
 Please rise."
Kanon rose expressionlessly, and Kumasawa got to her feet timidly.
"In the morning,
 you two went to wake Genji‐san because he had slept in, right?
 And at that time, you noticed that the door was sealed, broke the seal, and opened the door, correct?"
"......Y‐...yes.
 ......I thought it was some kind of prank."
"I didn\'t think deeply about it at the time."
"I\'m not asking for your opinions. Just give us the facts.
 Did you break the seal when you entered the room?"
""Y‐yes...""
"With the red truth, I\'ll guarantee that Eva, Kanon, and Kumasawa\'s statements just now are the truth.
 {p:1:At {nobr:1 a.m.}, Eva sealed Genji\'s sleeping quarters, and that seal was broken by Kanon and Kumasawa in the morning when the crime was discovered}.
 Just to save time, I\'ll add on some more."
"{p:1:During the short break at {nobr:1 a.m.}, the first two to leave the dining hall were Rosa and Eva.
 Until Eva returned, everyone in the dining hall remained there.
 After seeing Rosa off, Eva went to the sleeping quarters and sealed it.
 Of course, she did not enter the room at all at this time}."
"This is all information I discovered by gathering it from the people involved.
 These are not baseless red truths.
 They are truths I arrived at through proper reasoning constructed from testimony.
 And not only testimony—I took fingerprints and performed every kind of forensic test available to me."
"After all, Kinzo‐san\'s study is a treasure trove of all kinds of chemicals!
 I obtained all sorts of scientific evidence, which is truth in its purest form and infinitely close to red truth.
 However, this isn\'t a science mystery, so I\'ll spare you the details."
As Erika swaggered around the cathedral, she arrogantly touted her scientific knowledge.
She had thorough knowledge of all the chemicals in Kinzo\'s study and had used them to conduct a scientific investigation,
 which had now been acknowledged and made into red truth by {f:5:Bernkastel}.
......Without going into too much detail, the results she had obtained would have been convincing even without the red truth.
Fingerprint collection with aluminum powder.
{n}Composition analysis on the mud under people\'s shoes. Various chemical reactions from clinging rain water.
......Erika had walked in and out of the study that didn\'t belong to her several times,
 using all manner of chemicals however she pleased without asking the family\'s permission.
However, no one could fault her for this.
{n}The pieces couldn\'t hinder any action the detective might take for the investigation.
{n}That was the power of the detective\'s authority.
"............You act like you own the place...
 ......From now on, I\'ll warn everyone I meet never to welcome in any guest who calls themselves a detective."
"I believe that would be wise.
 Giving shelter to a detective is just about the worst omen of misfortune out there."
".........This is proof...
that it was only possible to reach Genji\'s sleeping quarters and commit the crime...
between midnight and {nobr:1 a.m}, just as with the murders in the guesthouse.
 And furthermore, Erika\'s investigation also proved that it was impossible for Genji to reach the cousins\' room."
It had already been made clear in red truth that, after transferring the phone call to Natsuhi,
 Genji had gone straight back to the servants\' quarters.
Now, based on the results of Erika\'s scientific investigation, they added a further red truth:
 {p:1:Genji never left the mansion after 24:00}...
This made it clear beyond doubt that Genji couldn\'t have reached the guesthouse,
 much less the cousins\' room......
"That leaves......only Krauss and Natsuhi...!
 All other people have had their alibis proven!!"
"......Im...
...possible.........
 ...............—"
Natsuhi\'s mouth flapped open and shut like a goldfish starved of oxygen.
And that was an accurate analogy.
......Natsuhi\'s mind was blank and spinning out of control, and she felt as though she really would suffocate.
"......Ushiromiya Natsuhi.
 ......I\'ll give you one last chance.
 Confess that all of the crimes were the work of your husband."
"D‐......don\'t be ridiculous!!
 Do I look like the kind of woman who would falsely accuse her husband?!!"
"......Beato.
 Natsuhi\'s denied it.
 I\'ll give you the same chance.
 ......You understand, right?
 ......Please don\'t tell me...
that you expect to be able to take advantage of the fact that Krauss is missing to try and pull a Devil\'s Proof on me......"
".........gah, ghh............"
Beato realized that they were rapidly approaching the end of this battle.
Normally, these alibis of Erika\'s would still have many places that Beato could argue against using the blue truth.
However, all of those alibis had been accepted by {f:5:Bernkastel} and {f:5:Lambdadelta} as red truth,
 and Beato no longer had any room to argue......
"......It\'s like.........Erika\'s creating the plotline,
 and those witches are distorting things so that everything matches up with it..."
"That\'s right.
 If the Game Master, Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}, accepts a truth, its authenticity will not be questioned.
 The world that comes after will be formed based on the truth that remains in the end.
 ......This happens no matter how far this final truth is from the real truth."
"There\'s no way Uncle Krauss is the culprit.
 He\'s being held prisoner somewhere.
 ......W‐wait,
 we can\'t deny the possibility that Aunt Natsuhi was skillfully tricked into believing that during the phone call......"
"Do you suspect Natsuhi and Krauss, Battler‐kun?"
"Well............"
"Erika\'s truth has been constructed in a cowardly fashion, but it is a proper truth.
 She may be colluding with a witch, but it has still been acknowledged as red truth.
 In other words, it cannot be a fake truth built only on lies."
"......This means that even Erika\'s truth makes sense.
 The truth about Natsuhi and Krauss being the culprits is also very possible.
 It may be a hollow truth, but it is {i:consistent}.
 ......It\'s a fiction that holds the same worth as truth.
 ......Which of those two truths will you believe?
 That is for you to decide."
".........No.
 ......I\'ll...............trust Aunt Natsuhi...and Uncle Krauss.
 I realize that they\'re in some money trouble."
"But even so, ......I don\'t want to believe that they\'re the culprits.
 No, I can\'t believe it...!"
"How do you intend to get Natsuhi out of this position, where she\'s so cornered by red which is slowly but surely closing in on her?"
"I, ......I don\'t know......
 But I......seriously don\'t want to give up...!
 Aunt Natsuhi\'s been caught in a cowardly trap, that\'s all.
 ...And Erika\'s reasoning is all part of it...!
 So whether it\'s intentional or she\'s being manipulated, Erika is aiding the true culprit."
".........Even if Erika {i:has} accused Aunt Natsuhi of being the culprit, ......and even if everyone else here believes that,
 ......that\'s exactly why I want to be the one person who trusts her...!"
If everyone assumes it\'s true, does it become the truth?
{n}If everyone accepts a lie, does it become the truth?
Must the solitary truth‐teller...
be dragged to the guillotine to the jeers of liars?
"I......don\'t like it.
 ......If no one will believe Aunt Natsuhi, then I will...!!"
"Real truth isn\'t something that\'s determined when everyone thinks something sounds reasonable!
 It\'s something you arrive at after thoroughly investigating both possibilities...!
 So this trial is a downright lie!
 It\'s a kangaroo court that exists for no reason other than to set Aunt Natsuhi up as the culprit!!"
"......Beato is doing all she can to plead Natsuhi\'s case, you know."
"Wrong.
 Beato is trying to refute Erika\'s argument.
 ......She\'s just defending!
 You can\'t fight in this trial by simply resisting all of your opponent\'s claims.
 This is why Beato always cornered me in the past...!"
"She isn\'t going to beat Erika by finding flaws in her reasoning!
 She has to find a different truth and show {f:5:Lambdadelta}, the ruler of this game...
...
that her truth is more correct than Erika\'s...!!"
"Without violating any of the red truths that Lady {f:5:Bernkastel} has shown,
 can you weave together a truth where Natsuhi isn\'t the culprit......?"
"......I, ......I don\'t know...
 But, .......as long as I don\'t believe that Aunt Natsuhi is the culprit, there\'s got to be a different truth!"
"I don\'t even care if the culprit for the crime ends up being a witch.
 That\'s better than having Aunt Natsuhi be framed by an incorrect truth...!!"
".........So, no matter how much red truth you are shown,
 you won\'t believe that Natsuhi is the culprit, correct?"
"Yeah......!
 For everything, there should always be some people who believe and some who don\'t...!
 No matter how much evidence is stacked up against her, someone has to believe that she\'s innocent!
 I\'m sure there are countless truths in the world that can\'t be proven with evidence.
 I don\'t ever want to accept that something\'s true just because everyone says it is!!"
How can you be sure that there\'s nothing on the far side of the moon if you\'ve never seen it?!
Is there some reason that you have to believe it?!
Until you see the far side of the moon with your own eyes,
 you can\'t rule out the possibility that nothing is there,
 and neither can you rule out the possibility of a thriving culture of space bunnies...!
You should never assume something is the truth until you actually check it.
This court is maliciously trying to force a single interpretation on a truth that can\'t be checked.
I once believed there was a society on the far side of the moon!!
But that was in elementary school, and I was made fun of and laughed at.
 So I thought it was embarrassing to think that a society lives on the moon......
...and I threw away that belief.
I\'d been told by a book my mom read me that rabbits lived on the far side of the moon,
 and I believed that for a long, long time.
......But when everyone said that was wrong,
 I abandoned that truth without even trying to check it!
......Even without evidence,
 I abandoned the truth I believed in......!
And now, everyone is starting to believe that Aunt Natsuhi is the culprit.
Even though not a single piece of decisive proof has been shown...!
There\'s no proof, but Erika\'s words sound reasonable, so they\'re probably the truth......?
 {i:That\'s} your reason to abandon your belief that Aunt Natsuhi is innocent?!
"If no one else will believe, ......then I will...!
 I believe that real truth only surfaces if you look with both eyes, one denying and one affirming...!!
 No matter how much they try to make Aunt Natsuhi out to be the culprit, it\'s my belief that she isn\'t!
 And I\'ll never give that up!!"
"...............I understand.
 Then allow me to grant you a single red truth.
 This is the single bit of power I will give you, now that you hold the will to fight in the truest sense."
"Power.........?"
"By the name of the Finite Witch {f:5:Virgilia},
 .........no, as the former witch {f:5:Beatrice}, I grant you this red truth."
{a:c:
"{p:1:Ushiromiya Natsuhi is not the culprit}!"}
"............!!!!"
"Plea bargain.
 ......If you acknowledge that Krauss is the culprit,
 Erika will cease her pursuit of Natsuhi.
 From then on, the investigation will proceed assuming that Krauss, whose location is unknown, is the culprit."
"What\'ll you do, Beato?
 At this rate, Natsuhi\'s in serious trouble, right?
 ......Will you accept the plea bargain?
 If you\'re willing to abandon this Ushiromiya family honor thing, Bern says she\'ll let you off with a draw.
 She\'s being really soft on you, you know...?"
Krauss was currently missing, and it was unknown whether he was alive or dead.
{n}Like Kinzo, he was no different than a "cat in a box" that had disappeared into the mists of the island.
The cat in the box is a creature of infinite variation; no interpretation of it can be denied.
It is the root of endless interpretations.
 The true source of the Endless Witch\'s power.
In other words, no matter how much {f:5:Bernkastel} were to claim that Krauss was the culprit,
 ......she wouldn\'t be able to make that the sole truth.
That is, the Krauss culprit theory and the witch theory could exist in almost perfect balance.
......Beato could make the game a draw.
{f:5:Bernkastel} was......tempting her.
 She was offering her a second chance if she would abandon the honor of the family she\'d sworn to protect...
and consent to weaving a fragment that would trample all over that honor.
There was no room for false confidence.
 For Beato, to lose was to die.
......Unless she could see herself having an overwhelming advantage in this game, the right move had to be to actively pursue a draw.
"......Mmg.........ugh........."
"I will not allow you to call my husband a killer!!
 My husband is the next in line to the Ushiromiya family headship!!
 The one person who will inherit the glory of the Ushiromiya family!
 I will never allow you to brand him as a criminal...!!"
"......Are you sure, Natsuhi......?
 .........If you refuse to suspect Krauss, ......then...you\'ll be the only one left.
 ...Alibis have been proven for everyone else, ......in other words, Hempel\'s Raven...!
 Even without any evidence, ...it will be determined that you are the culprit...!"
"And so what if I\'m the only one left?!
 I am Ushiromiya Natsuhi!!
 I will not run or hide!
 I am innocent!!
 And I am the representative of the noble head, with the One‐winged Eagle engraved into my heart!!"
"If you wish to insult me, go ahead!
 If you wish to ridicule me, do as you please!!
 But none of you can damage my honor with fiction!!"
With a dignified voice, ......Natsuhi stated her case openly before the witches above her.
However, this response of hers...
might have been exactly what {f:5:Bernkastel} had intended...
"......Natsuhi refuses the deal.
 .........And you, Beato?
 ...You understand, right?
 The instant Natsuhi is singled out, Lambda will deliver her verdict.
 As soon as that happens, the witch illusion will be denied, and you\'ll vanish into mist.
 ......Do you plan to let Natsuhi\'s foolish stubbornness drag you down to the depths of hell...?"
"...............nn............gah........."
"......Riiche.
 You fought well.
 ......Now\'s the time to withdraw.
 Convince Natsuhi and try to work out a compromise...!"
"Both Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta} and Lady {f:5:Bernkastel} have boredom, not you, as their true enemy.
 ......I imagine they would like to play this game over again.
 If they see that you\'re willing to make a concession, they will most likely accept it gladly...
and move on to the next game."
"If we move on to the next game, .........then what will happen to the Natsuhi of this game,
 ......the Natsuhi of this fragment......?"
"Now isn\'t the time to be worrying about that!
 Natsuhi is just a piece!
 Even if she gets removed from this game, she\'ll show up again in the next one!"
"But the same does not hold for you, Milady...
 Through this game, I believe you have learned the moves that Lady {f:5:Bernkastel} has up her sleeves.
 It\'s a more realistic goal to make use of that and aim for victory in the next game instead.
 ......Accepting Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}\'s deal might be your one and only good option right now...!"
"Throw away that useless pride of yours!!
 Neither Kasparov nor Deep Blue won every game!
 The person that wins more games wins in the end, right?!
 If a witch gets too attached to a single match, a single life, a single piece,
 ......that witch dies!!"
"............My apologies,
 .........but I cannot do that.
 .........I know the strength of a man who believed even though everyone said he was wrong,
 ......and I know the suffering he went through when he was forced to abandon that belief...!"
"I will not abandon Natsuhi!
 Why?
 Because if everyone else suspects Natsuhi, then someone has to believe in her!
 Because truth can only be found in the gap between those who doubt and those who believe...!!"
"I won\'t abandon her!
 Even if everyone believes that Natsuhi is the culprit, I will still claim that a witch is responsible...!!
 If I can\'t even make that claim, my existence isn\'t worth anything...!!"
"......I can\'t afford to lose.
 "Truth" isn\'t for anyone to deny."
"......It\'s something that disappears...when you doubt it and abandon it yoursel{-}l{-}l{-}l{-}l{-}l{-}lf!!"
"Is that your answer, Beato......?"
"Yeah, of course I refuse!!
 Ushiromiya Krauss is not the culprit!!"
".........Fool.
 There\'ll be no coming back from this, you know...
 Here\'s what you get for being a quick‐tempered moron.
 By the name of {f:5:Bernkastel}, Witch of Miracles, I speak with the red truth.
 {p:1:Ushiromiya Krauss is not the culprit.
 And he was killed long ago.
 Shortly after you heard his voice over the phone, in fact}."
"N‐.........no.........
 ...D‐.........darling...............aaah...aaagghhhaaaaaaaaahhhh........."
{f:5:Bernkastel}\'s cruel and ruthless red blade gouged Natsuhi......
......It was......all too merciless.........
The lack of knowledge of whether Krauss was alive or dead had almost crushed Natsuhi with anxiety, but she had at least been capable of believing that he was alive...
And now, ......that hope...that expectation.......had been crushed......without any chance for a miracle......!!
She had thrown herself into this trap out of concern for her husband\'s safety.
With the loss of her daughter and husband.........she had now lost everything she had gained since marrying into the Ushiromiya family.
No, ......even after all this,
 .........one thing still remained.
If her husband was lost, .........then right now, she was the last person who could protect the honor of the Ushiromiya family.
She still......couldn\'t let it end here.........
Even wrapped up in so much sadness, ......Natsuhi would do all she could to protect that honor...
with her last ounce of strength......
"Nope, it\'s all over!
 It\'s been determined with the red truth that none of the remaining people in the dining hall left that room until one o\'clock.
 In other words, alibis have already been proven for everyone except Natsuhi!"
"......Well done, Erika and {f:5:Bernkastel}!
 You\'ve fully proven that the crime was impossible for everyone except Ushiromiya Natsuhi!
 Why don\'t I start reading aloud from the verdict."
"......At midnight on October 4th, 1986, the defendant, Ushiromiya Natsuhi,
 left before the others while pretending to return to her room to sleep,
 and murdered George, Jessica, Maria, Rosa, and Genji one after another during the one hour period before {nobr:1 a.m.}!"
"Let me add something on.
 Due to circumstantial evidence, include the murder of Krauss."
"Yeah, that\'s right.
 In this situation, it\'s unthinkable that anyone except Natsuhi could kill Krauss!!"
"A revision to the verdict!
 During the hour before {nobr:1 a.m.},
 Ushiromiya Natsuhi killed Krauss, George, Jessica, Maria, Rosa, and Genji one after another!
 It\'s only possible for any of these murders to have taken place between midnight and one o\'clock!
 The only person without an alibi during this time was Ushiromiya Natsuhi...!
 From this point forward, the game will proceed treating the defendant as the true culprit."
"Furthermore, because it has been fully proven that the crime was possible for {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s...
 {f:5:Beatrice}, the Endless Witch...!!
 This Court of Illusions hereby denies your existence!!"
"You have a chance to plead your case. Can you prove an alibi for Natsuhi?
 Or can you show the possibility of someone other than Natsuhi being responsible?
 If you can just do that, Natsuhi will stop at being one shade short of absolutely guilty,
 and the denial of your existence will be put on hold for this game......"
If Natsuhi had an alibi, Beato would have shown it long ago.
{n}In fact, wasn\'t the whole point of that trap to make her lose her alibi......?
"Even if her alibi is not proven, ......I will believe in Natsuhi\'s innocence...!!
 No matter how much you all try to pin your fake truth on her!!
 I am the true culprit!
 Natsuhi is innocent!!
 Even without any proof!!"
"......The truth is known only by the master of the night on this island, {f:5:Beatrice} the Golden.
 I am Ushiromiya Natsuhi!
 Now that my husband has passed away, I am the head of the Ushiromiya family!!
 My spirit will not be broken no matter how you try and humiliate me!"
"Why, you ask?
 It is because Father gave me permission to engrave the crest of the One‐winged Eagle into my heart...!!
 How can your evidence and alibis negate the honor and the crest engraved into my heart?
 They cannot!!
 The Ushiromiya crest emblazoned on my heart is immortal!!"
.........Now that Natsuhi and {f:5:Beatrice}...
had practically been placed on the guillotine,
 ......they cried out with all the strength of their determination...
However, that did nothing except bring a cold smile to the game master {f:5:Lambdadelta}\'s face.
Erika had constructed a truth that {f:5:Lambdadelta} could accept.
......And no one could construct a more convincing truth to deny Erika\'s.
In that case, the most convincing truth would swallow up everything else......and become the one and only "truth".
Even if it happened to be different from the real truth.
The truth of those in the past is swallowed up by the truth of those in the future.
......Even if that truth is a fiction.
{n}As long as everyone acknowledges it to be true...!
".........You\'re all bark and bluster.
 ......I like it best when witches sob and beg for their lives when they\'re about to be burned at the stake.
 When they try and act tough like you do, it\'s such a buzzkill.
 So I think I\'ll send you one final gift: a red truth to crush your bluster once and for all."
"Wh‐.........what do you mean.........?"
"......D‐
.........don\'t, ...Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}...
 ......Isn\'t it already going to be overwritten with the truth you desired......?
 Your truth and Natsuhi\'s should be able to coexist...
 Please don\'t defile it......
 .........Please............"
"{p:1:Natsuhi.
 When did Kinzo ever say it was okay for you to engrave the One‐winged Eagle into your heart?
 Those were just the words of the Kinzo from your delusions.
 ......The real Kinzo?
 Throughout his entire life, not {i:once}...
did he ever trust you from the bottom of his heart,
 and not once did he ever consider letting you bear the family crest}!"
When that heartless announcement was made.........Kinzo stood up.
"Natsuhi!! You need not listen to this!!
 No one can defile the crest engraved in your heart!!
 That is yours alone!!
 Do not ever forget your pride as the final head of the Ushiromiya family!
 Natsuhii{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}iii!!"
"Just shut up and disappear.
 You putrid delusion, vomit of Natsuhi\'s mind."
"Nngggaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aahhhhh!!
 You can\'t erase me! You can\'t erase my soul!!
 Not as long as Natsuhi continues to engrave the crest into her heart!!"
"You lying illusion.
 {p:1:The real Kinzo would never say such a thing.
 Begone,
 you fantasy of Kinzo inside Natsuhi\'s mind, beautified by her to suit her own purposes}."
"Gwaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}ah{0}h{0}hha{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}ahhhh,
 Na...
tsuhi......
nnggwoo{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}oohhhhhhh...!!!"
Bright red flashes of lightning smashed Kinzo over and over again as he screamed.
Then, he crumpled like a doll......and sat back down in his chair as though nothing had happened.
The fierce emotion had left Kinzo\'s face.
He had truly......become like a wax model.
{n}And so, .........he would never again share kind words with Natsuhi...
.........Yes.
The true Kinzo...
......never once trusted Natsuhi during his entire life.
The true Kinzo...
...never once thought about allowing Natsuhi to bear the One‐winged Eagle.
......Although it doesn\'t deserve repeating,
 ...Kinzo had already passed away before the game began.
The Kinzo appearing in this game...
......was nothing more than Natsuhi\'s...
......delusion......
Everything about this Kinzo,
 ......who believed in Natsuhi and entrusted her with protecting the family honor...
...was an illusion...
......created by Natsuhi.........
"{p:1:Pitiful woman.
 Now is the time for you to face the truth that you never gained Ushiromiya Kinzo\'s trust as long as he lived}."
"Wah...
......waaah......"
"......Natsuhi.........
......don\'t cry.
 ......Kinzo...
entrusted the Ushiromiya family...
to you, did he not......?"
......No, he didn\'t.
Not only did he not entrust her with that,
 ......he never said hello...
......or met her gaze even once.........
"......Uu, ......uwaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aahh......!!
 Aaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}ahhhhhh!!"
Natsuhi\'s cry,
 a mixture of sadness and many other emotions,
 echoed throughout the cathedral......
......Natsuhi could no longer stop her tears.
Some last, faint element that had cheered her up until today,
 that had allowed her to endure as an Ushiromiya, as the wife to the head\'s representative, ......and as the final family head...
......had been torn to bits......
Natsuhi no longer...
...had anything left.
Natsuhi could no longer allow herself to even call herself an Ushiromiya.........
The difficult days, the painful days.
The days where she still gave everything she could for the family she\'d married into despite it all.
......The rare happy days that existed among them.
All of these flitted through her mind, one after another...
......and disappeared.
All of those once beautiful memories,
 ......now crushed by {f:5:Bernkastel}\'s red truth,
 .........smashed into tiny shards that scattered everywhere,
 ...buried themselves deep into her hands,
 ......and soaked them red with the blood of sorrow...
.........It was...
the red of sadness...
and truth.
"That is all.
 ......All it takes is the presence of this crime,
 and a deduction like this becomes trivial for Furudo Erika.
 ......Your thoughts, ladies and gentlemen...?"
{f:5:Lambdadelta}...clapped.
Then, a little later than expected, {f:5:Bernkastel} began to clap as well, looking satisfied.
The expressionless, wax‐figure‐like audience followed suit,
 and the unshakable verdict was welcomed with great applause.........
And so, .........the "truth" of this tale...
was decided.........
Right now, no humans exist on this island except for those in this parlor.
And with one exception, it has been shown that none of them have committed murder.
And, the culprit is among these people.
"......Whoa, whoa.
 ...In that case, ...it\'s conclusive, isn\'t it...?"
"Unless the culprit is a witch who committed murder with magic, that is..."
"............It was you?!
 You killed George, killed my husband?!
 Why?!!
 Whyy{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}yyy?!!"
"I, ...I didn\'t kill anyone...!
 I, I, d‐didn\'t do...!!"
"....................."
In a panic, and with a voice that really couldn\'t be called flowing,
 ......in a manner that was, to put it coldly, unsightly...Aunt Natsuhi denied the suspicion placed upon her...
However, ......there was no longer any way around it...
{i:The girl} stood up, ...brushed back her long hair, pointed at Aunt Natsuhi, and said it one more time.
"......You are the culprit.
 Ushiromiya Natsuhi‐san."
Red‐faced and tear‐streaked,
 ......Eva walked up to Natsuhi...
...and grabbed her by the collar.
Then, wordlessly, she slapped Natsuhi\'s cheek.
Natsuhi, who had never been slapped in her life,
 was shocked by her first ever taste of iron.
It turned into a scuffle between Eva and Natsuhi.
Battler immediately tried to stop them,
 but Eva planted a sharp knee into Battler\'s gut and he doubled over.
"Give them back, give back George and my husband!!
 Why did you kill them?!
 You murderer, murdereeeeeeeer!!"
Sobbing, Eva kicked Natsuhi, who had fallen to the ground, over and over.
Battler tried once more to cut in and stop them, but he was brushed aside,
 ......and after that, no one tried to stop them.
Repeating her son and husband\'s names over and over, Eva kicked Natsuhi.
 And kicked her.
Then she started grabbing whatever her eyes fell upon and throwing it.
......Natsuhi was hit with a steaming teacup,
 ...then a can of black tea, whose tea leaves fell out all over her.
She was kicked, her hair pulled and dragged up,
 her cheek slapped so many times that it started to swell.
No one tried to stop it.
{n}It wasn\'t because they were worried about Eva kicking them too.
It was because they thought it an appropriate act of retribution for a person who had lost her beloved son and husband.
A proper...retribution.
 A proper...truth.
Everyone in the parlor accepted that Natsuhi was the culprit.
 ......They accepted the truth that Erika claimed.
So it became a proper truth, and Natsuhi was designated as the proper culprit.
She had already lost the husband and daughter who would have protected her,
 ......and even Kinzo, who should have given her a final bit of strength, had already vanished like a bubble in the ocean of illusions......
No longer...would anyone protect her.
 No longer...would anyone believe her. So she was now...the true culprit.
Eva\'s shoulders heaved with her heavy breathing.
{n}......Apparently, her anger still hadn\'t abated.
Erika patted Eva\'s shoulder and made her take a step back.
......Of course, this wasn\'t to protect Natsuhi from violence.
It was to further humiliate her, ......now that she had been branded as the culprit.
"Natsuhi‐san.
 I\'ve solved two of the three riddles.
 The whodunit.
 The howdunit.
 The final riddle—the whydunit—must always be confessed by the culprit herself.
 Please follow the rules of the mystery genre and confess."
The whydunit......refers to the motive.
"If this was a third‐rate mystery,
 ......you would let out a high‐pitched laugh about now, confess to the crime,
 and start telling the story of your sad past.
 ......Don\'t tell me you intend to make me explain that part as well?"
"......I am not the culprit!!
 Someone, believe me!!
 I had my husband taken hostage, and I was blackmailed......I was framed...!!"
Natsuhi, with her hair a mess and her face red and tear‐streaked,
 ......protested to everyone,
 .........but no one met her gaze.
Because it had already been resolved that Natsuhi was the culprit.
Because {f:5:Lambdadelta} had acknowledged that the culprit of the tale was Natsuhi and woven it that way,
 none of the pieces would pay any heed to Natsuhi\'s......to "the culprit\'s" words...
"Natsuhi isn\'t the culprit!!
 I am the Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}!!
 I am the one who commands Rokkenjima\'s night and who has reigned since long before the time you were all still scared of the dark!"
"Why can\'t you just call it my sin? Why must you suspect Natsuhi?!!
 Acknowledge me!!
 I committed all the crimes!!
 It cannot be the work of a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}! It cannot beee{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}ee!!"
The witch illusion had already been crushed, ......and Beato\'s voice didn\'t reach anyone.
The verdict had already been announced.
 ......Everything had been decided.
"No one can hear you.
 You\'re a phantom, a mere illusion!
 Go back to being a simple portrait!
 You\'re a frail illusion of a witch, born when the relatives shared in Kinzo\'s fantasy!!
 That is the truth chosen by this world!!"
"So, Great Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}!!
 Now is the time for you to bury this presumptuous and foolish illusion that calls itself a witch...!!"
"Goodbye, {f:5:Beatrice}.
 .........I made you a witch hoping that you would either become my friend,
 or help distract me from my boredom.
 And you\'ve answered my expectations.
 The second one, that is.
 ...Eheheh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eheh!!"
"......I...
...am a witch......
 Even if you don\'t acknowledge it, Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}...
 ......I am a witch........."
"You wouldn\'t even have been capable of believing that if I hadn\'t become your guardian in the first place...!!
 Okay, it\'s game over for you now.
 I\'ll bury you in accordance with the rules of your game board.
 ......What happens to the losers in your game, again...?"
"Beato has already shown that clearly in a previous game.
 You get tossed into the goats\' dinner party as a lump of living flesh and are chewed to bits."
"Now there\'s a fitting end for you, {f:5:Beatrice}.
 And I did come all the way here just to hear the death cries of one as haughty as you...!!"
One by one, a massive number of unspeaking goat attendants
 slipped out from behind pillars and began to fill the cathedral.
The goats paid no attention to Natsuhi, who was seated in the center,
 but the crowd completely enveloped her.
From Beato\'s point of view up on the balcony,
 ......it must have looked like a huge boiling pot of goats.
"...............Heh,
 ......*cackle*,
 ...haha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha!!
 That\'s right,
 ......this was our contract from the beginning...!"
"Yep.
 Our contract said that whenever you stopped entertaining me,
 you would relieve me of my boredom with your life!"
"Come, strip the title of witch from this woman and throw her into the pot of goats!!"
Suddenly, there were goats standing right behind Beato.
......They lifted her up roughly.
"Let me hear some nice screams.
 You\'re a bottle of wine we\'ve been saving for this day."
"......Then remaining silent will be my final strike back at you..."
"Yes! I made her say it!
 Uhihihahaaah!!
 The screams of those who gift me that line as their parting shot are the most gratifying of all!
 ......Now fall!
 {f:5:Beatricee{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}eeee}......!!!"
The goats carrying Beato no longer viewed her as their master.
After holding her above the pot of clambering goats,
 which were snorting heavily in anticipation......
...they threw Beato\'s slender body into the air.
All at once, the squirming goats faced the heavens and raised their arms.
It was almost as though...
devouring her flesh would allow them to forget their pain for just a short while.
As she flew through the air, Beato tried to smile boldly,
 ......but it was so forced that it seemed even more pathetic,
 greatly pleasing {f:5:Bernkastel}.
When Beato fell into the pot, the goats caught her.
Of course, they didn\'t do it gently.
The arms of countless goats pulled at her flesh to keep it for themselves.
They tried to tear her to bits.
It didn\'t have to be flesh.
{n}Hair, fingernails, shoes, even bits of her dress worked just fine.
The mouths of those goats were the gateway into hell.
However, Beato was too big to pass through that gateway.
So they had to chew and tear her...
into bits small enough to fit into it...!
.........Beato let out a bold laugh.
{n}She laughed from inside the pot of goats.
However, her expression was very different from the one she had intended.
 .........It was an expression not of a witch, ......but of a single {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} screaming out for the final time.
Then, the sea of goats parted.
Dlanor leapt forward, slicing all the goats in her path with a single flash of her longsword.
......It was a thin slice, like cutting through butter.
The goats were surprised by Dlanor\'s sudden appearance and stepped back.
In the center, {f:5:Beatrice} cowered in tatters,
 ......sobbing......
"What\'s the meaning of this?
 Inquisitor Dlanor."
"My apologies, but I have something to {f:5:say}.
 There is someone who has an objection to this {f:5:verdict}.
 His name is...
Ushiromiya Battler."
All of the goats stared at Battler.
"What do you find unsatisfactory about the court\'s {f:5:decision}...?
 ......I assume you possess new evidence or truth sufficient to request a {f:5:retrial}...?"
"........................gah......"
I get it.
 ......Dlanor is offering me a helping hand.
If she hadn\'t jumped in here, it\'d all be over.
And I fully understand now how I\'m supposed to fight.
But it\'s that very understanding......that makes me unable to fight.
Because I know I can\'t win by simply countering Erika\'s truth.
If I want to deny her truth, I\'ll need to present a different one.
...And I still don\'t have a clue what that truth is......!
"There is nothing that time cannot {f:5:heal}.
 And there is no truth that cannot be reached if you spend enough time {f:5:searching}.
 ......However, all courts place time limits upon determining the {f:5:truth}.
 And a truth that cannot be reached within that time limit cannot become {f:5:truth}."
......Yeah, ...I know that......!!
{n}By now, everyone is certain that Aunt Natsuhi is the culprit.
{n}It might be too late now, ......even for the real truth...!
Aunt Eva\'s violence will probably go unstopped,
 and no one is even thinking about protecting Aunt Natsuhi.
It\'s no longer a situation where we can say "oh, the truth will eventually be found".
And in this world, ......even the time allotted to us to expose the truth...is very short.
It\'s already midnight and the end of the game.
The police won\'t come.
 The truth won\'t be revealed!
Only the truth decided upon here and now will remain...!
"..........................."
I slowly stood up,
 ......walked in front of Beato,
 ......and faced Dlanor.
.........I have no plan.
 I don\'t know the truth.
......However, ......if I don\'t jump in now, I won\'t get another chance to fight...
The red used by Erika\'s group is mercilessly strict.
I seriously doubt that I can put together a truth where Aunt Natsuhi isn\'t the culprit without violating that red......
"......Why the uncertain {f:5:face}?
 How {f:5:pathetic}."
"D‐.........dammit........."
"......B‐......Battler......"
"I\'ll be the one to kill you.
 ...I want to keep that promise.
 ......And yet,
 ......right now,
 ......I don\'t have any plan at all......"
"............That\'s okay...
 In this world,
 ......there is no truth.
 ......The truth is made later on and overwrites what comes before it.
 Real truth...
...doesn\'t exist anywhere......"
"This is a wonderful turn of events, Dlanor.
 Yes, the execution of a princess would be no fun at all without a knight appearing to rescue her.
 ......And there could be nothing better than having him beheaded before her very eyes!
 Bury the old piece and the unneeded player together!!"
"As you {f:5:wish}.
 Glory be to the great Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}!
 I am the Chief {f:5:Inquisitor}, Dlanor {nobr:A. Knox}...!!
 Step {f:5:forward}, Ushiromiya Battler!!"
"D‐......dammit, I\'ve got nothing more to lose...
 If you wanna see me struggle, here you gooo{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}ooo!!"
The only reason Erika\'s theory is so strong is because of those seals.
She was given red so quickly just because {f:5:Lambdadelta} easily bought the alibis created by those seals.
But the seals aren\'t red truth!
{n}Just sticking paper in a door crack is far from perfect.
There\'s no way something like that can prove anything with "certainty"...!
"Begin, Battler!!
 Ready to let those goats turn you into a pile of meat along with your beloved {f:5:Beatrice}?!"
"Oh, and I\'ll mix the leftovers from your precious sister into that pile.
 Wouldn\'t that make for a wonderful stack of meat?
 ......Then we can wrap it up in a dumpling, steam it and maybe add some soy sauce!!"
"No, the best way would be to fry them in a pan with some eggs and ketchup!!"
""Ahyahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hhhya{0}hhya{0}hya{0}yhya{0}ha{0}ha{0}haa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aaahhhh!!""
"D‐dammiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiittt!!"
"{p:2:Can\'t we doubt the reliability of these seals of Erika\'s?!
 Something like wedging some paper in a door can\'t create a perfect alibi!
 It might be that someone noticed by chance and happened to put it back in the same place}...!!"
The blade of my blue truth should have slashed diagonally through Dlanor\'s chest.
...However, Dlanor\'s expression didn\'t budge in the slightest, and there wasn\'t a single wound on her chest.
"I was wondering what you\'d throw out there, but this is ridiculous..."
"......Allow me to explain.
 This is what I sealed the doors with.
 ......Did you think this was paper, Battler‐san?"
Erika once again held up the thing that looked like brown paper.
"This is duct tape.
 Its adhesive power is extremely strong.
 ......I scored it with scissors to make sure it tore easily."
"Furthermore, across the center seam and the edges affixed to the door and the frame...
I wrote my signature, which is impossible to reproduce.
 Therefore, it\'s impossible to tear it off without leaving a mark, and it\'s impossible to reattach too...!"
"Applying to unsheathe the Red {f:5:Key}."
"Granted."
"{p:1:Due to the above, the seals are guaranteed to be {f:5:perfect}.
 Miss Erika\'s seals were not broken by anyone, and deception is {f:5:impossible}}!!"
"{p:2:I\'ll acknowledge Erika\'s seals...!
 However, Auntie Eva\'s seal on Genji‐san\'s room should be different}!!"
"{p:1:Eva\'s seal was of the same type as Miss Erika\'s.
 That is because this method of sealing was one that Miss Erika and Eva conceived of together after {f:5:dinner}}."
"{p:2:Erika fished through the chemicals in Grandfather\'s room saying she\'d use them for forensic testing, right?!
 There might have been some kind of solvent among them!!
 If you used that, you might be able to tear off the duct tape without leaving fingernail marks}!!"
"For your attention: I beg to inform you of the following.
 {p:1:It is impossible to tear off any of the seals by any method without leaving marks}."
"For your attention: I beg to inform you of the following.
 {p:1:There were no suspicious marks on any of the seals}...!"
"This proves that there was no tampering done to any of the seals.
 Repetition requested!!"
"Yes, gladly.
 {p:1:All of Erika and Eva\'s seals...
were not tampered with in any way that hindered their ability to act as seals, such as being scraped off}."
"......Dammiiiiiiit...
 damn you, sticking duct tape all over the place that leaves marks on whatever it touches......!"
Dlanor isn\'t my only enemy.
{n}There\'s also her subordinates, Gertrude and Cornelia.
{n}And also Erika and her master {f:5:Bernkastel}.
{n}And even {f:5:Lambdadelta}, the one who hijacked Beato\'s game!
Everyone in this cathedral is an enemy.
That fierce rush of red immediately repelled my feeble truth.
......It\'s obvious why. I don\'t have any alternate truth.
{n}Even at this final stage, ......I have nothing...
"Were the seals all that you had to {f:5:discuss}?
 You promised to give me everything you {f:5:have}."
"..................kh........."
If I only knew a truth that could prove Aunt Natsuhi\'s innocence...
{n}If I could only make a theory that weaves its way through Erika\'s red......
......Dammit, I don\'t know anything!!
".........Do you have any chance of winning...?"
"......I left it at home.
 Mind if I go back and get it?"
"I have already lost.
 ......I am prepared for my fate."
"......I promised that I\'d kill you.
 So I won\'t let anyone else do it.
 I never break a promise...!!"
"That\'s a lie.
 ......I will never trust one of your promises again."
"Huh?
 When did I ever make a promise to you and lie about it...?"
"............Heheheh, ...*cackle*cackle*cackle*.
 ......After hearing you say that, hell might not be so bad.
 ......Eha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha, gaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha...!!
 Kill us! {f:5:Bernkastel}, {f:5:Lambdadelta}...!!
 Hyahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haa{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha!!"
Beato let out a shrill cry, overcome with laughter.
{n}......It was a broken laugh, and tears streamed down her cheeks.
Battler\'s words would no longer reach her ears.
She kept on laughing insanely, like a broken record......
"Is it {f:5:over}?
 {f:5:Pitiful}.
 I truly am {f:5:disappointed}, Ushiromiya Battler...!!"
"Hyah{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha, hiihha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haa{0}ha{0}ha{0}hah{0}hya{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aahh!!

 Hyah{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haah{0}haa{0}a{0}a{0}aaahhh!!"
"Nng.........nngaaaaaaaaaaaaggghhhhh!!"
"{p:2:I postulate a method X that could lead someone to the upper floor of the guesthouse without passing through the lounge!

"{p:1:Knox\'s 8th:
 It is forbidden for the case to be resolved with clues that are not {f:5:presented}}!!"
"{p:2:Everyone committed suicide...!!
 So there is no culprit}!!"
"For your attention: I beg to inform you of the following.
 {p:1:All deaths were homicides}."
"{p:2:Erika didn\'t personally examine the corpses, right?!
 It should be possible for people who aren\'t the detective to make a mistake when examining the corpses}!!"
"For your attention: I beg to inform you of the following.
 Be advised that {p:1:no examination of any corpse is ever mistaken}!"
"{p:2:Then maybe there were body double corpses!!

"Be advised that {p:1:no corpses exist except those of characters who have appeared in the story}."
"{p:2:Th‐then how can you claim that Uncle Krauss is dead without his corpse?!!
 Doesn\'t that violate Knox\'s somethingth or whatever}?!!"
"Be advised that {p:1:the red truth is simply truth, and there is no need to provide evidence or proof}!!"
"Wh‐
......what the...
.....d‐
......damn it aa{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}ll......!!"
In the face of these insane arguments,
 ......all my effort to overturn the truth treating Aunt Natsuhi as the culprit is completely meaningless.
Each time I brandish my desperate blue truths,
 Dlanor and the others\' red truths knock me down to the floor.
......It\'s getting hard to even stand back up again.
...Does that mean......my body is telling me that I\'m about to surrender...
to the truth where Aunt Natsuhi is the culprit...?
Their red truth is getting more and more perfect......
Each time I think I can slip through a chink in their armor,
 Dlanor smacks me down with the red longsword of Knox......
"......Hihihiha,
 hiihii,
 ......haha, haha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha......"
"............Beato......"
"That\'s enough, Battlerr...
 ......This will at last be...
the end of the eternal torture that torments me—no, us.
 ......Let us fall together into the depths..."
"........................gah..."
I don\'t...
want to see Beato like this......
Her majesty as the ruler of the Golden Land...
...and her enthusiasm as my adversary...
...are completely gone.
She\'s just a pitiful woman who\'s been trampled over and who has lost all hope,
 with tears streaming down her face and a tragic smile that I can\'t bear to look at......
"Does your truth no longer {f:5:exist}?"
No,
 ......I have one...
...last thing.
"......And that is a different truth, where Natsuhi is not the {f:5:culprit}?"
......No.
 All I can do is prove that Aunt Natsuhi isn\'t the culprit.
I can\'t show...
...what the real truth beyond that...
...is at all......
"......But even so, ......maybe at least you\'ll be saved that way."
"Why.........?"
"......I can show without a doubt that Aunt Natsuhi isn\'t the culprit.
 ...But I cannot present a different truth.
 ......If Erika\'s truth is dispersed, the crime will return to darkness, and there might still be room for you to exist."
"Assuming you can pull it off.
 .........But if you can\'t present a new truth, that means you\'re incompetent and useless as a player.
 I\'ll have you vanish from this game board for all eternity."
At this point, the Game Master is {f:5:Lambdadelta},
 ......and she\'s there too.
This probably doesn\'t mean defeat in a single game,
 but being banished from this game for all eternity as the loser.
From what the witches have said in the past,
 I can faintly imagine the place "pieces" are sent when they\'re banished.
It\'s known as the depths of oblivion,
 ......an eternal darkness that lies on the far side of an eternal oblivion and where there is no concept of life or death...
......I\'m...going to disappear.
 But still, ......Beato will remain.
As long as Beato remains, no matter how suspicious Aunt Natsuhi is,
 ......there will always remain space for the witch to be the culprit...in other words, room for Aunt Natsuhi to not be the culprit.
......As long as that wiggle room is there, ......someone will eventually expose the truth.
It doesn\'t have to be me.
Eventually, ......someone, at least, will smash this fake truth to pieces......!
I understood that this...
...was the time to abandon myself for the sake of this other person who would eventually appear,
 ......for the sake of the real truth......
"......Well,
 ......it looks like I\'ll have to break my promise to kill you after all."
"Don\'t.
 Don\'t leave me as the only one alive.
 I\'ll disappear with you.
 Let that be your final tribute to me.
 ......I beg you, if you just grant this one wish, I won\'t need anything else......"
".........Have you said your last {f:5:goodbyes}?
 ......I really am disappointed in {f:5:you}, Ushiromiya Battler."
"Hurry up and put him out of his misery.
 We still have to get to my monologue exposing Natsuhi‐san\'s crimes."
"You guys really are interesting.
 {f:5:Beatrice}.
 Ushiromiya Battler."
"......But I\'ve gotten tired of you.
 You aren\'t needed in {i:our game}.
 .........
*giggle*giggle*giggle*,
 ehe{0}he{0}he{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahah!!
 Do it, Dlanor!!"
"This is the {f:5:end}.
 ......If you still have one last bit of power,
 let me see you muster it now, in your last {f:5:moments}...!"
"Nn.........

It\'s a small but brilliant red truth.
{n}My last trump card, courtesy of {f:5:Virgilia}...!!
Erika......this takes your theory back to square one...!!
"Go for it...if you think you can."
{a:c:
Take thiiiiiiiiiiis}!!!
"{p:1:Ushiromiya Natsuhi is not the culprit}!!!"
The red truth is simply truth, with no evidence or proof required.........!!
This will make Dlanor stagger...!!
Even if that\'s all it does,
 ......it\'s the first and last strike I can make...!!
"{p:1:Knox\'s 2nd:
 It is forbidden for supernatural agencies to be employed as a detective {f:5:technique}}."
...............Huh......?
 My...
...red truth...
......was blown away by Dlanor\'s red longsword......
"......In this court, if anyone other than witches is going to speak the red truth,
 they\'ll have to construct an appropriate proof for it.
 Erika has been following this protocol, why can\'t you...?"
True, Erika herself hasn\'t used the red even once so far.
......She\'s always had the witch {f:5:Bernkastel} make those statements by using repetition requests......
"Your red truth isn\'t something you obtained for yourself.
 ......It\'s a supernatural truth gifted to you by a paranormal entity.
 In other words, it isn\'t reasoning.
 It\'s no better than a random thought......"
I‐
......in that case,
 ......if I have {f:5:Virgilia}...
...say the same red truth......
Where is......{f:5:Virgilia}.........?
"If you are to present that red truth, you must construct an appropriate {f:5:argument}.
 ............Can you do {f:5:that}......?"
No, .........it\'s impossible............
I just have the truth that Aunt Natsuhi isn\'t the culprit...
.........without any basis or evidence.
".........See......?
 ......Real truth......is a very fragile thing.
 ......Does real truth exist...?
 And is it necessary......?
 ......Even without it, ......the story goes on......
 ......Battleeer........."
"Now, Battler.
 ......Prove the red you have {f:5:shown}.
 ......If you cannot, this is {f:5:goodbye}."
"............Then...
...this is goodbye.
 ......Sorry,
 Beato."
"......Don\'t say that.
 Thanks for sticking around with me.
 ......It was such a blood‐stained tale...
......but it was fun..."
"{p:1:This court is now {f:5:disbanded}.

 <Great equalizer is the DEATH>}!!"
Then, the trial for the fifth game was over.
{n}The detective, Furudo Erika, accused the culprit, Ushiromiya Natsuhi.
There are three riddles that the detective must explain.
The first is the whodunit.
 Who is the culprit?
As previously stated, it is Ushiromiya Natsuhi.
The second is the howdunit.
 How did they carry out the crime?
During the hour between midnight on October 4th, 1986 and {nobr:1 a.m.} the next day,
 Ushiromiya Natsuhi went to the cousins\' room on the second floor of the guesthouse and the servants\' quarters on the first floor of the mansion.
 There, she carried out the murders.
It is only possible for the crime to have taken place during that hour,
 and for that one hour, alibis have been proven for all characters except Natsuhi.
From the sky, a massive, red longsword, even greater in size than the one Dlanor held, came crashing down like a thunderbolt,
 and pierced through Battler\'s heart, pinning him in place while he still stood......
In that instant, {f:5:Beatrice} vanished in a spray of gold,
 ......and her former minions disappeared as well.
As the heartless witches looked down at the cathedral\'s center, laughing coldly,
 ......all that remained was Battler, with the red longsword sticking through him, and Dlanor.
"Agh.........nng...
...............gghh........."
"......Rest in {f:5:peace}, Ushiromiya Battler.
 It is a {f:5:shame}.
 I thought you were a more capable person than {f:5:this}."
"...............guh........................"
Battler blew bubbles of blood,
 ......closed his eyes slowly,
 ............and expired......
Dlanor stared on in silence,
 ......then turned on her heels when she saw his life leave him.
After that, all that remained was the corpse of this sorrowful man, pierced by the sword that acted as a massive, red grave marker,
 and lit by the faint glow let in from the cathedral\'s skylight.........
And then, there is the third riddle that the detective must uncover.
The final riddle...the whydunit.
{n}Why did they commit the crime—
the motive.
In third‐rate mysteries, there\'s no need to uncover this.
After all, even if you don\'t expose the motive, the culprit will just confess it when all\'s said and done.
However, Furudo Erika was first‐rate, so she would expose even this.
Natsuhi was confined in the parlor, under everyone\'s watchful gaze.
Then, with everyone\'s assent,
 Erika diligently and persistently searched all places, even Natsuhi\'s room, for clues about her motive.
"Well, now that we have all gathered,
 just what is it that drove Ushiromiya Natsuhi‐san to commit these terrible murders?
 Through my investigation, I, the detective Furudo Erika, have discovered the general outline that explains this.
 I would like to announce it now."
Everyone remained silent, urging her to continue......
Erika tossed some of Natsuhi\'s possessions that had been "confiscated" onto the table...
"First, these are past diaries that were discovered in Natsuhi‐san\'s room.
 They have barely been used at all in recent years,
 but they describe in detail the period shortly after she became a part of the Ushiromiya family."
"Most of them were locked, but in order to find the full truth behind this crime,
 I used my authority, which everyone has acknowledged,
 to destroy the locks on all of them."
"......Y‐
......you monster......
 ......Reading...
...another person\'s diary......"
"If we\'re monsters, what does that make you, murderer?!!
 A criminal like you has no right to privacy!!"
"And this is what I found from these diaries.
 Natsuhi‐san ended up married to Krauss‐san due to special circumstances."
"......I imagine that all of you here know much more about this than I do.
 Natsuhi‐san and Krauss‐san were not married because of love or as a normal arranged marriage.
 ......If anything, it was more like taking a hostage."
"Th‐......that is not true!!"
"This is written on the 24th page of this red diary:
 .........‘I am a hostage being imprisoned by the Ushiromiya family under the guise of marriage.
 However, if everything can be resolved this way......’"
"Natsuhi‐san.
 Right here, you\'ve already admitted that you were a hostage.
 ......Kumasawa‐san, you have served Natsuhi‐san since the time she first came here, right?
 Could you tell me about what it was like at the time?"
".........Y‐......yes, that\'s correct.
 ...I did catch wind of something similar to what you describe...
 ......I think that by now, the only ones who would know the details of Madam\'s marriage...
...are Doctor Nanjo and myself..."
"Very true......
 ......That was during Kinzo‐san\'s golden era, when he did whatever he pleased...
 He defeated all of his enemies and expanded his financial power.
 ......Natsuhi‐san\'s family was one of those enemies."
As though the time to talk had suddenly come at hand,
 Kumasawa and Nanjo openly delved into territory that should never have been touched upon again......
It concerned the period during which Kinzo was most feared for his ferocity.
Although he was financially very powerful and had many connections,
 the elite looked down upon him as an upstart, which gave him a complex about his social standing.
To combat this, Kinzo wanted to find Krauss a wife from a noble family...
and use this to raise the Ushiromiya family\'s status...
He waged a financial war against Natsuhi\'s family, beat them down, ......and then proposed that a marriage be performed as a method of reconciliation.
And the person he picked......was Natsuhi.
She was a veritable princess, raised good and true by a family of Shinto priests.
By choosing her, not only did Kinzo cause them the worst possible humiliation,
 he also won what he considered to be the greatest possible trophy.
So that marriage proposal was humiliating to Natsuhi from the very beginning......
"Regarding the events of this period, both Kumasawa‐san and Doctor Nanjo\'s claims just now...
match with the contents of the diaries."
"Therefore, since the time Natsuhi‐san first took the name Ushiromiya Natsuhi,
 she has held a strong animosity towards the Ushiromiya family.
 ......What do you have to say, Natsuhi‐san?
 Do you admit this?"
All of the cold gazes turned to face Natsuhi...
"I‐......it\'s true that I thought that at first......
 I thought I was being forced into a marriage without love, ...a hostage under the guise of a bride......"
"However, ......my husband......never viewed me as a mere hostage......
 ...He understood what I had gone through and gave me compassion and affection......
 My husband......was the only person who could understand me...!"
"......I see.
 That makes sense.
 There are indeed a number of places in your diaries illustrating that Krauss‐san knew of your difficulties...
and showed concern for you."
"However, on page 47 of this diary here,
 you describe these moments as being unpleasant, correct?"
"Let me read aloud.
 ‘When Krauss tries to show consideration, it only makes me feel more wretched.
 Sometimes, I think he might even be trying to humiliate me further.’
 ......From this, we can tell that Natsuhi‐san was repulsed by her husband and the concern he showed."
"W‐......wait...!
 Yes, I may have thought that at the beginning...!
 Back when I lived every day in fear for my future, I couldn\'t accept his concern as true...
and yes, I may have written of my distrust from time to time...!
 But I eventually realized he was sincere and grew to accept his feelings...!"
"Well, nothing like that appears in any of these diaries."
"I, ......I never even wrote it down,
 those feelings were so secret...!"
"Multiple diverse pieces of evidence and testimony...
make it clear that you had an intense hatred for your husband.
 On the other hand, your claim,
 that you eventually accepted his feelings, is unsupported by evidence."
".........I, I loved my husband...!!"
"You can\'t find any testimony or evidence that can be used to elevate that statement to the level of red truth, can you?"
"D‐......does a person need evidence to say they\'re in love...?!"
"Nothing can be trusted except for red truth...!!
 Statements that aren\'t red don\'t count as evidence at all, and they can\'t be trusted at all!
 All text that is not red is a falsehood that exists to deceive me!!"
"‘I love him’?
 Who would believe a profession of love in white text?
 No non‐red words can ever be trusted!!
 The only things that can be trusted in this world are the red truth and the pieces of evidence I offer to my master to obtain it!!"
"You lying {y:0:Humans}{n:0:humans} can\'t speak the truth!!
 {y:0:Humans}{n:0:Humans} lacking the red truth have no right to speak of love or the heart or truth!
 Did you know?
 Men aren\'t as stupid as you women think they are.
 Men never really take it seriously when a woman says "I love you"...!"
"......What a pitiful person......
 I see you\'ve never truly loved someone..."
"Romance is unnecessary for a detective.
 I don\'t think I\'ve ever used the word "romance" except to explain the motive for murder."
"No matter what you say, we loved each other...!!
 I owe my husband an apology for always writing down my complaints and nothing else...!
 But I gave my heart to him...!!
 Even if I can\'t prove it with evidence, ......that is the truth!!"
"Overruled.
 You just don\'t know when to give up, do you?
 From evidence and testimony, it\'s clear by now...
that you hated both your husband and the Ushiromiya family."
"That\'s right!!
 I can\'t even count the number of times I\'ve heard you complain...!!"
"Don\'t we all...? I remember there being days when you talked behind Hideyoshi‐san\'s back...!"
"You {i:killed} my husband!!
 How {i:dare} you say that?!!
 Die! Die so you can apologize to my husband in the afterlife!!"
"Please cease your violence, Eva‐san.
 This is my delectable moment where I question and convict the culprit.
 It\'s not yours, okay?"
"Now then.
 Over the next several years, she appeared to have gotten used to her new way of life,
 but in actuality, an intense hatred still lurked in her heart.
 Taking that into consideration, there would be nothing odd at all about her deciding to take revenge."
"D‐don\'t act like you know what I\'m thinking...!!"
Each time Erika read from Natsuhi\'s diaries,
 ......she exposed another of Natsuhi\'s emotions during those painful days.
......Natsuhi hadn\'t written them down to record them for posterity.
{n}She had written to forget those memories and seal them away.
That was why, after writing down her feelings during those painful days,
 ......she had locked them up and sealed them away for all eternity.
However, Erika claimed that these were Natsuhi\'s true, hidden feelings...
that had been locked away and concealed.
Since it had already been "concluded" that Natsuhi was a murderer, everyone accepted Erika\'s claim.
By this point, the red truth wasn\'t even necessary to establish Natsuhi\'s motive.
{n}As long as the reason seemed plausible, everyone would believe it.
No matter how much Natsuhi might object, no one would believe her.
No one could accept the truth Natsuhi spoke of, about the days she had spent loving her husband.
And so it was being painted over by a false truth, in which she hated her husband and swore revenge against him......
The pen of the gods that composes the truth had been given to Erika.
"And so what?!
 Who gives a damn about your past?!!
 Murderer, murdereeeeeer!!"
"S‐stop that...!
 I can understand how Natsuhi‐san felt...!"
"I always thought this day might come, eventually......
 ...Poor thing, poor thing......"
"I think she\'s another one of the pitiable victims...
of Father\'s wild life."
"I knew of the pain in Madam\'s heart......
 I always tried to support her......
but I failed, and look what has happened......"
"......I don\'t...
...even understand...
...the emotions of love and hate."
".........You will, someday.
 They can give you a reason to live...
and also a reason to kill."
"....................."
"...........................
 ......I‐
......is Aunt Natsuhi...
...really the culprit...?"
"Well, now that you mention it, there is...
one last person besides Natsuhi‐san that might be the culprit."
"Wh‐......what?
 Hey, are you serious...?!
 Why the hell didn\'t you say something that important sooner?!!"
"Natsuhi‐san.
 The truth is, there is one person besides you for whom the crime was possible.
 ......If you insist on claiming that you aren\'t the culprit,
 it means that person must be the culprit."
"............Huh......?"
"Who is it...?!
 Who...?!"
"Ushiromiya...Kinzo‐san."
".........Ah, ............"
"Early this morning, Kinzo‐san...
went outside through the window of the third floor study, and his location is unknown.
 Isn\'t that right, Battler‐san?"
"......Mgh........."
"Just like Natsuhi‐san,
 Kinzo‐san has no alibi whatsoever.
 The truth is, for this crime, it was possible for Kinzo‐san to be the culprit as well."
"I simply assumed that he never existed in the first place,
 so I completely forgot about him until this very moment.
 Allow me to apologize."
She didn\'t look shy or apologetic in the slightest.
Erika bowed in as unpleasant a manner as ever...
......Even now, she\'s still holding a grudge over her defeat in the study...
"Natsuhi‐san, you gained Kinzo‐san\'s trust and are the person who served closest to him, isn\'t that right?
 In that case, I think you understand better than anyone else...
...that this incident is actually the crime of the family head, carried out by Ushiromiya Kinzo‐san."
"Y‐
.........you dare...
...call Father......a criminal......?"
"Don\'t worry.
 Even if Kinzo‐san is actually the culprit,
 I have prepared more than enough evidence and testimony to explain the whydunit.
 Even if you were to say, for example, that you were putting yourself on the line to cover for Kinzo\'s crime, I am more than capable of carrying forward such a plot."
"In recent years,
 even the theories created by the detective can sometimes change the plot itself.
 You really can\'t afford to be careless in this day and age."
"......Branding Father as a killer...
...is something I will not allow!!"
"Natsuhi‐san.
 Calm down, place your hand on your chest, and think carefully.
 ......If you accuse Kinzo‐san of being the culprit, this entire case will be resolved.
 You will no longer be held accountable for another person\'s actions, and your honor will be restored."
In other words, by pushing the crime onto Kinzo, Natsuhi would be saved......
However.........
"I, ......I have been entrusted with the honor of the Ushiromiya family......by Father...
 ...Do you really think......that I would defile Father\'s honor...the Ushiromiya family honor...
just to clear away the false accusations made against me...?!!"
Of course, Natsuhi knew that she wasn\'t the culprit.
{n}And she also knew that Kinzo wasn\'t.
So being framed herself and pushing the blame onto Kinzo...
were both unacceptable, unbearable outcomes.
"Are you sure?
 As I have already established quite thoroughly,
 alibis have been proven for everyone except you.
 If you do not accuse Kinzo‐san,
 ......then it really will be clear that you are the culprit,
 and that {i:will} become the truth......"
"If labelling me as the culprit is what you call truth,
 then you can do as you please...!
 I am certain that God knows I am innocent...!
 And one day, he will prove it!!"
If it came to a choice between her or Kinzo being framed for these crimes...
{n}......Natsuhi would sacrifice herself.
Perhaps...
...that was her way...
...of protecting the Ushiromiya family honor.
"...............Aunt......Natsuhi........."
"And I even gave you a chance..."
...............Stupid woman.
This future where your name will eventually be cleared...
doesn\'t exist, not for you or any of the other pieces in this game.
Natsuhi......had made her decision.
If they were going to call her the culprit,
 ......she would let them.
She boldly rejected the thought...
of selling Kinzo\'s honor to gain a momentary truth where she wasn\'t the culprit......
And, therefore...
...the tale would be woven with her as the culprit.
If, in the future, the accusations against her were to be proven false,
 this tale would probably be rewritten......
However, such a future would never come.
......I think...
truth is a fleeting thing.
Even if I am a good person up until my death...
...if some heartless person after my death writes down that I wasn\'t a good person,
 and that is shared with everyone else...
......then even all the goodness in which I lived my life will be overwritten easily.
And so, I think...
{n}I must live as a good person for all eternity......
"......If you claim that Kinzo‐san was not the culprit,
 he will need an alibi which proves that the crimes were impossible for him.
 Otherwise, we cannot truly be certain that you are the culprit, Natsuhi‐san."
Erika had to be well aware by now...
...that Kinzo was nothing more than an illusion to muddy the waters of the inheritance problem.
However, proving him to be an illusion would be very hard.
The only way to do this would be to confirm Kinzo\'s death,
 ......but Kinzo died a long time ago, as revealed by the red truth of previous games.
And in this fifth game, his body hasn\'t even appeared.
Under these circumstances, it wouldn\'t be easy to prove his death conclusively......
If Kinzo\'s death could be confirmed, ......it would practically erase that defeat in the study.
It was the only way Erika had of negating the humiliation of her loss.
And there was something that could confirm Kinzo\'s death almost as certainly as real proof.
And that was...............“the confession of the culprit”.
She would have Natsuhi herself admit that Kinzo no longer existed in this world.
That way, it would be acknowledged that Erika\'s reasoning in the study was correct,
 ......that loss would be painted over, and it would be rewritten as Erika\'s victory......
Battler hung suspended by Dlanor\'s red longsword.
Beato had disappeared by having her existence denied, ......and her minions had gone too.
Now that they had disappeared from this cathedral,
 ......only Natsuhi and the witches convicting her remained.
"So,
 ......you still claim that Kinzo is alive and remains somewhere on this island......?"
"Yes, I do...!
 Father is in good health...!
 No matter what anyone says, I will not change my statement...!"
"The red truth from the previous games says that
 {p:1:Kinzo is already dead}.
 ......But that\'s not enough to satisfy you, right, Bern?"
"......Yeah, that\'s right.
 I\'m after a perfect victory.
 ......So there\'s nothing interesting about getting a checkmate just because Kinzo\'s death has been confirmed by the red.
 ......I want to win by forcing Natsuhi to say that she\'s resigned.
 *giggle*giggle*giggle*!"
"Then why don\'t you try it?
 Show me what you\'ve got."
"My master, let us now achieve a perfect victory...!!"
"Of course.
 ............Natsuhi.
 You say that Kinzo is certainly alive, but you don\'t know where he is, correct?"
"Yes, that\'s right...!
 Father left through the window and his location is unknown...!
 He is so troublesome sometimes......!"
"Lambda.
 I\'m going to make Kinzo\'s location from midnight until the morning absolutely clear.
 ......
{p:1:From midnight until morning, Kinzo stayed in the same room}."
"......?
 Well, duh, he was a corpse after all.
 ...........................
 ...No, I\'m sorry.
 That\'s right, totally right.
 I won\'t butt in.
 It sounds interesting, so keep going."
".........From now on, I will use the word "Kinzo" to mean "a living Kinzo".
 After all, Natsuhi claims that he\'s alive.
 ......I\'ll say more with the red truth.
 {p:1:Kinzo does not exist anywhere outside the mansion}.
 ......Isn\'t that right? Erika."
"Y‐yes, my master...!!
 I searched for Kinzo all over the premises outside the mansion...!
 However, I was unable to find him...!"
Because of the detective\'s authority, Erika could "find all clues".
Therefore, if Erika was unable to find "a hint that Kinzo existed outside the mansion",
 it was the same as proving that Kinzo didn\'t exist outside the mansion.
Therefore, {f:5:Bernkastel} repeated that truth of Erika\'s...
"{p:1:Kinzo does not exist outside the mansion}.
 ............So, Natsuhi.
 That means that {i:if Kinzo exists}, he must be somewhere inside the mansion.
 Do you have any idea where Kinzo might be hiding......?"
"H‐how could I know...?!
 After all, think of the weather.
 After going out into the courtyard, it would not be surprising at all...
if he hid somewhere in the mansion to escape the rain...!"
"Pfft, ......*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*.
 I\'m going to repeat that same question several times during this process.
 ......I\'ll give you many chances for an honorable surrender.
 ...If you\'re too stubborn, you\'ll lose even your true honor."
".........N‐no matter how you threaten me, I will not give in...!!"
"*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*.
 I just love teasing pieces like you.
 ......Then, let\'s keep going."
"......For these reasons, it is unthinkable that Kinzo‐san might be somewhere outside the mansion.
 ......After learning that, we performed an extensive search of the third floor, where the study is."
"However, there was nowhere he could have been hiding.
 .........We didn\'t catch any trace of Dad on the third floor."
"So then, where is he, Natsuhi‐san?"
"I, I don\'t know...!
 If he isn\'t on the third floor, perhaps he\'s hiding in the basement...?"
"Ah, yes, the basement.
 We searched all of that suspicious basement, including the boiler room and the underground storeroom."
"Yes, I searched too...!
 I didn\'t see Father anywhere...!"
"I\'ll ask again.
 Where is Kinzo‐san, Natsuhi‐san?"
"I‐in that case, he was probably on the first floor or the second floor...!!"
"I see, process of elimination does tell us that, doesn\'t it?
 We then thoroughly searched the first floor.
 And the result?"
".........Nope.
 We were unable to find Father."
"I\'ll ask again.
 Where was Kinzo‐san, Natsuhi‐san?"
"Th‐then he was probably hiding on the second floor...!!
 How should I know where Father is hiding?!"
"Are you sure about that...?
 I think you know very well where Kinzo‐san was hiding..."
"M‐
......Madam knows where the Master was...
...hiding......?!"
".........That\'s...impossible..."
"That......can\'t be true......"
Both Shannon and Kanon knew that Kinzo was no longer alive.
So they didn\'t have a clue how Erika was planning to corner Natsuhi...
using a phantom of a person who didn\'t exist......
"{p:1:Kinzo is nowhere outside the mansion.
 Kinzo isn\'t on the third floor.
 Kinzo isn\'t in the basement.
 Kinzo isn\'t on the first floor.
 Therefore, the only place Kinzo could possibly exist is the second floor}."
"I accept that red truth.
 ......Natsuhi.
 Kinzo should be somewhere on the second floor.
 Will you still not tell us where he\'s hiding...?"
"N‐no matter how many times you ask, it won\'t change the fact that I don\'t know!"
"Erika.
 Investigate the entire second floor, starting from one end and going in order.
 ......Use the detective\'s authority to avoid missing a single clue and to see through all types of hidden doors and hidden rooms...!"
"Yes, my master...!!
 Natsuhi‐san, you\'re quite slow, aren\'t you...?
 Can you still not see where we\'re going with this?"
"*giggle*.
 No need to give it away.
 Come on, Erika.
 Take everyone with you and begin the investigation...!"
Erika used her detective\'s authority to take everyone, even Natsuhi,
 up to the second floor to search every room, starting at one end.
Even for rooms that were thought to have nothing at all to do with the crime, Erika did not relax her search in the slightest.
...Her search was thorough in every single room as they moved through them all......
"So, you still won\'t tell us where Kinzo‐san is hiding?"
"Stop saying that!
 How many times do I have to say that I don\'t know...?!"
"Natsuhi‐san.
 ......It doesn\'t matter where we search, we won\'t ever be able to find Kinzo‐san, will we?"
"......?!"
Of course not.
 Kinzo doesn\'t exist.
No matter how long this search continues, it\'s just a waste of time.
This was known by both Erika, who was the witch\'s piece, and Natsuhi, the one who knew the truth......
"In that case, this search will end at the room on the far end of that corridor.
 ......In other words, it will have been proven...
that Kinzo wasn\'t in any of the rooms except that one. What do you think will happen then?"
He isn\'t on the third floor or the first floor or the basement,
 and he isn\'t in any of the rooms on the second floor except possibly the one at the end.
So if he really did exist inside the mansion,
 .........it had been proven that he could not be in any room except for that room at the end.
In other words, this was Hempel\'s Raven.
Because it had been established that a "living Kinzo" didn\'t exist anywhere except the final room at the end of the corridor,
 that automatically meant that a "living Kinzo" existed in that final room...
......And that room at the end of the corridor was......
"Oh, ............ah.................."
"Which room was at the end of the corridor, again?"
{f:5:Lambdadelta} was munching on another refill of popcorn.
"That\'s Natsuhi\'s room, Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}...!!"
"......In other words, Kinzo had no place to hide except inside Natsuhi\'s room.
 ......*giggle*giggle*giggle*!
 Do I need to say it in red?"
"Of course...!"
"{p:1:Kinzo does not exist anywhere outside Natsuhi\'s room}!"
"Well then.
 That means this room is the only place left.
 ......From everything we have learned, we now know that Kinzo‐san isn\'t anywhere outside this room."
"B‐......but this is my room!!
 Where exactly in my room do you claim Father is hiding...?!"
In a rage, Natsuhi unlocked the door to her room and pointed inside.
......Of course, Kinzo was nowhere to be seen.
"Do you see Father anywhere in here?!
 Look!!"
".........Yes, it seems as though he isn\'t here.
 Do you think he realized we were coming and escaped out of the window again?"
If Kinzo wasn\'t in this last room, ......it meant that he didn\'t exist anywhere.
"There is no living Kinzo outside the mansion".
{n}"There is no living Kinzo inside the mansion".
Therefore, “no living Kinzo exists”.
However, Erika didn\'t make that argument.
{n}She had brought things to this point, but she didn\'t make it checkmate...
It was because {f:5:Bernkastel} didn\'t want to win by cornering Natsuhi with the red truth,
 but by forcing Natsuhi to admit to a humiliating resignation......
"I have not only been searching for Kinzo‐san himself all this time.
 I have been looking for any sign at all that Kinzo‐san hid in these places between midnight and the morning.
 And no such signs have existed."
"......In other words, we know that from midnight until morning,
 Kinzo was always holed up in the same room,
 and that was Natsuhi\'s room!"
"It means the checkmate of red truth has finally...
trapped the piece known as "the illusion of Kinzo" inside Natsuhi\'s room."
"So, Natsuhi‐san.
 This means you were with Kinzo in this room until morning.
 Do you still claim that you didn\'t know where he was?"
"I\'ll acknowledge it with the red truth...!!
 {p:1:For the entire duration of the night between midnight and morning,
 a living Kinzo could not have existed anywhere outside Natsuhi\'s room}!!
 Based on this truth, I permit you to continue the debate under the assumption that he could only have existed in Natsuhi\'s room!"
"Plea bargain.
 ............Come on, Natsuhi.
 ......Even someone as stupid as you must have realized the fix you\'re in now.
 This is your last chance.
 .........Make Kinzo the culprit."
"Call the Ushiromiya family head a criminal and crush the head\'s honor to save your own skin.
 If you show that you have the guts to do that,
 I\'ll change the plot into one of a tragic heroine taking the blame to protect the family head."
"Father is innocent!
 I cannot call Father a criminal!!"
"......Deal refused!
 Ehehehehehehehe, okay, Bern.
 Do it...!"
"{p:1:For the entire duration of the night between midnight and morning,
 a living Kinzo could not have existed in any place except inside your bed}."
".........Wha—
......and...
...wh‐
...what do you mean...by that............?"
"After conducting a thorough search of this room,
 and detailed forensic testing,
 I discovered that Kinzo did not exist anywhere in this room between midnight and morning.
 However, your bed alone is excluded from this."
A shocked silence dominated the room......
{n}Natsuhi completely forgot to close her open mouth...
"Last night,
 at around the time the gold was discovered—I estimate 23:00—
Kinzo‐san escaped from the window on the third floor and snuck into the bed in your room.
 ......And, as an even more unfortunate result from my investigation,
 it has been proven that you were also sleeping in that bed."
"I\'ll repeat that.
 {p:1:For the entire duration of the night between midnight and morning,
 a living Kinzo could not have existed in any place except inside Natsuhi\'s bed.
 And last night, Natsuhi also slept in that same bed}."
"Wow, look how close they were.
 So, you two were so close to each other, you slept sharing the same pillow?"
"Blue truth:
 {p:2:Therefore, we can conjecture that Ushiromiya Natsuhi and Ushiromiya Kinzo had sexual relations with each other.
 Why else would a man and a woman share the same bed all night long}?"
"H‐how dare you!!!
 T‐t‐to suggest that I would...
...d‐do such a thing......with the father I respected so much...
...I won\'t allow you to say such things!!"
"Natsuhi.
 Use the red truth to counter this blue truth.
 Of course, you aren\'t a witch, so there\'s no red that you can use.
 So I\'ll speak with the red truth in your place.
 If you can show me convincing proof...!!"
"H‐
......how could there possibly...
b‐be proof of that?!!
 How low are you willing to sink to mock me?!
 Y‐you vile creatuu{-}u{-}u{-}u{-}u{-}u{-}u{-}u{-}u{-}u{-}u{-}u{-}u{-}ure!!"
Natsuhi tried to attack Erika,
 ...but Eva pinned her arms behind her back, so she couldn\'t do anything.
"How unsightly.
 ......In order to take revenge against the Ushiromiya family,
 you first schemed to take control of everything the family owned.
 For that reason, you used your body as a weapon and ensnared Kinzo‐san."
"I would never do anything of the sort!!
 I have never given my body to anyone except my husband!!"
"I understand why you\'d want to deny it,
 ............but testimony from several witnesses makes it clear that you have had repeated secret meetings with Kinzo‐san."
"I mean, even last night, you and Kinzo‐san...
were all alone in his study when you went to "say goodnight to him", weren\'t you?
 Not only that, I have obtained multiple pieces of testimony claiming that there were clear traces of sexual relations."
"Are you insane?!?!
 Who was it?!
 Who said something so ridiculous?!
 G‐Gohda?!
 Shannon?!
 Was it Eva‐san?!
 Yes, you must be behind something this ludicrous!!"
"Who was it?! Whooooo?!
 Aaaaa{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}hhhhh!!!"
"I acknowledge receipt of the relevant parties\' testimony.
 Wow, this is pretty fatal.
 *giggle*giggle*giggle*...! No room for doubt now!"
"Hey, Natsuhi.
 Looks like you don\'t even have a scrap of honor left now.
 ......I\'ll give you one final chance before I weave you the worst of all possible fragments.
 ......Say to me that there was no Kinzo."
"Yeah. Natsuhi, you sure are stubborn.
 ......The Ushiromiya family has already been torn to ribbons, right?
 ...Are you really that desperate to confuse the inheritance problem by pretending Kinzo exists?"
"This is my final trial, entrusted to me by Father......in protecting the honor of the Ushiromiya family...!!
 My husband\'s business will definitely......definitely bear fruit!!
 Until we can use that to repay our debts, I cannot hand over the inheritance of the Ushiromiya family!!"
"I will protect Father\'s honor and my husband\'s!!
 That is......my mission!!!"
"......Wanting to protect the honor of the dead is an admirable trait."
"He\'s not one of the dead.
 We\'re talking about the honor of a convenient delusion inside Natsuhi\'s head.
 ......
{p:1:The real Kinzo never once ordered Natsuhi...
to do anything like protect his honor}."
"Waaaaaaaaaaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}ahhhhhhh!!"
As Natsuhi screamed, she fell down to her hands and knees......
She no longer...
...had any way to reject the fake truth...
...that {f:5:Bernkastel} and Erika had weaved......
".........By my name as the Game Master, {f:5:Lambdadelta}!
 ......I acknowledge that Lady {f:5:Bernkastel} is the victor of this game.
 ......If anyone has any objections, state your name now!!"
.................................
Of course, there were none.
 All of those who might have objected had been erased......
"No objections!
 You win, Bern, and what a win it was!
 Now weave the fragment of truth!!"
"Sure.
 Then I will now weave the truth.
 ......This is the truth of this sad and foolish tale.
 ......Although, what I really wanted was for Natsuhi to admit to her crimes while smiling through tears and then tell her own story.
 After all, that\'s standard in the genre, right?
 *giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*!!"
