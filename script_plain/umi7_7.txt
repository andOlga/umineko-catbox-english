"So...heheh...about earlier,
 sorry you had to see me acting like that... I blame the future heir......"
"It\'s not going to leave a mark, is it?
 Talk about merciless."
".........Did you say something, Jessica?"
"O‐of course not...!
 I\'ve already, uh, learned my lesson, okay?!"
Lion, who had apparently been chatting with the adult siblings, spun around with a smile and stared at Jessica.
 ......Looks like the older sibling\'s firmly in control around here.
"......Those are some sharp ears.
 I think I finally get this Lion person."
"Yeah, yeah, yeah!
 The future heir\'s always been annoyingly sharp!
 Not to mention the favorite of all the adults!
 I\'m always compared against this kid, at home and at school!"
"Come to think of it, Lion was the student council president for both middle school and high school.
 And the head of the badminton team too."
"So everywhere you go, you get compared to Lion, and it doesn\'t work out too well for you."
"I said it as soon as I got into middle school.
 The future heir was already the vice‐president of the student council.
 I said "if you\'re planning to become council president next year, that\'ll just put more pressure on me, so stop it!""
"But the next year rolls around, and guess who signs up as a candidate and wins in a landslide?!
 Same thing happened when I started high school!
 I said "please, just give it a rest this time", but by that point, the future heir was already the vice‐president!
 Then, senior year? Immediately president of the student council!"
"Dad was oh so proud!
 Mom kept saying "now you make sure you do your best as the little sister", over and over and over again!!
 Nngyaaaaaaaaaaahhhh!"
"But even so, you\'re still proud to be Lion\'s little sister, aren\'t you?"
"I‐i‐it\'s not like I ever thought about that!
 Nope, never! Not even once...!"
"It can be tough to be compared against perfection.
 Still, other people are other people, and you are you.
 There\'s no need to feel dwarfed.
 You should live the way you want to with all you\'ve got."
"Of course!
 But Mom and the others are always going on about how I need to follow in the footsteps of Ushiromiya Lion as the younger sibling.
 ......They keep telling me to go join the student council, go play badminton......"
"Don\'t you play in a band?"
"Wh‐......wha?!
 Sh‐shhhhhhh!
 That\'s a secret! No one knows...!"
Apparently, she\'s keeping it a secret from her family.
Interesting.
 ......People often like to blame their family for what they\'ve grown up to be like,
 but even in a different world with a different family, the interests of the girl called Jessica are the same as ever.
It\'s admirable that she has such a true and constant interest in something.
"I love that kind of stuff.
 "Pettan, pettan".
 "Sweets, sweets"."
"Wah, wah, wah!!
 Shh, shh, shh!!"
Nothing wrong with the extraordinarily accomplished sort, like Lion, but kids who act their age do have their charms.
"That\'s the best way to go through life.
 Enjoy your youth to the fullest."
"W‐well, uh......thanks."
Apparently, no one had ever told Jessica that they approved of how she lived,
 and the direct way Will had put it made her turn red and hang her head in embarrassment.
"I want to ask you two now."
"The same thing you just asked Maria‐chan?"
"Yeah.
 Please tell me everything you know about {f:5:Beatrice}."
"......Well, you can see how much Maria‐chan likes witches and the occult.
 For her, {f:5:Beatrice} is a symbol to be admired, like an anime heroine.
 She believes every little thing is some sort of prank caused by a witch\'s magic."
"You are an adult.
 And the fact that you never say this to Maria is also very adult of you."
"Of course.
 Childhood dreams only happen when you\'re a kid.
 I think respecting that precious experience is an adult\'s responsibility."
"Looks like the two of us will get along well."
George\'s position was that {f:5:Beatrice} was nothing more than a fairy tale.
However, that phrase—“respecting a child\'s dreams is the adult thing to do”—that might be worthy of further scrutiny.
When she got a candy from {f:5:Beatrice} by magic, Maria probably got excited and told George and the others.
Then, the adults followed his lead and positively went along with her story "as adults should".
However, there could be other ways this sort of reaction could occur, other than as an adult\'s response to a child\'s claims.
For example, it could be an inferior\'s response to the claims of their superior.
......If Kinzo, tyrant of the Ushiromiya family, claimed that {f:5:Beatrice} existed and had revived,
 perhaps the other members of the family would positively go along with his story "as his inferiors should".
Though {f:5:Beatrice} only appeared directly in front of a limited number of people,
......it\'s probably safe to say that the concept of her existence penetrated deeply within the Ushiromiya family, even among those who had never seen her.
However, no matter how deeply that concept penetrated, she was only viewed as a sort of fairy tale character.
It would be necessary to transform the concept of that character from an imaginary fairy tale into reality.
So, a person attempting to do this would need to perform something that could only conceivably be done by magic.
And that something......was the series of witch incidents that started with the nighttime window‐opening pranks played by Beato the Elder...
...and ultimately escalated to locked‐room murders.
......Beato the Elder referred to this, saying that the anti‐magic power filling the mansion would be weakened bit by bit the more she made her existence known.
{f:5:Beatrice}.
Why did you desire so greatly to make all others accept your existence?
Because the imaginary becomes the truth if everyone accepts it?
Because at that moment, the being called {f:5:Beatrice} will be acknowledged and will become {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}?
In that case, before {f:5:Beatrice} is acknowledged by all people, she\'s less than {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}.
 She\'s furniture.
Why would furniture want to become {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}?
It feels like this was the theme of the previous game.
Because they want to gain the right.
Furniture cannot ____.
So, they try to become {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} for the right to ____.
...........................
It really is quite simple.
......It\'s directly connected to the reason the chick Beato was born in the first place.
".....................
 ......I see.
 ......I do understand, but it\'s complicated."
I can\'t......ignore the heart.
"I feel bad for saying this at {f:5:Beatrice}\'s funeral,
 ......but, truth be told, I don\'t know enough about {f:5:Beatrice} to explain her.
 My apologies."
"As far as that goes, Jessica‐chan does live here, so she might know a little more than I do.
 ......Speaking of which, have you introduced yourself to this gentleman yet, Jessica‐chan?"
"Nah, not yet.
 ......There\'s this idiot going around pinching people\'s butts, so I didn\'t really have the chance yet...ehehe..."
A bit late, Jessica looked embarrassed for acting rudely in front of an unfamiliar guest.
She cleared her throat and made a beautiful bow that didn\'t fit well with her normal attitude.
 She even lifted the corners of her skirt in a curtsy.
"P‐pleased to meet you.
 ......My name is Jessica.
 Allow me to welcome you to the Ushiromiya family on this splendid day......
umm, I mean, please enjoy our hospitality...and......."
"......Willard.
 Call me Will."
"Huh?
 .........Huh?
 ...............Wah—"
Jessica\'s greeting had been of the old‐fashioned sort,
 so Will also treated her like an old‐fashioned lady.
 He bent down on one knee, took Jessica\'s right hand, and kissed the back of it.
"Wah, wah......waah........."
Not expecting her greeting to be returned in such an old‐fashioned and formal way, Jessica turned red and was unable to speak.
......However, Will had returned the greeting in what he thought was a perfectly serious way,
 so he didn\'t understand what was making Jessica\'s face glow.
"Have I done something strange?"
"No, no, I just didn\'t...ah, ahahaha..."
"I want to hear what you know about {f:5:Beatrice}.
 ...............nn."
A glow leaked from Will\'s right hand, which was grasping Jessica\'s.
Looks like the theatergoing power is having its effect on Jessica.
......Didn\'t mean for that to happen.
 Oh well...
"{f:5:Beatrice}, is it...?
 W‐well, I can tell you, .........but will you promise me something?
 Promise you won\'t laugh.
 Thinking about it now, ......it sounds more than a little crazy."
"What is it you know?
 I won\'t laugh.
 Tell me."
"S‐sure...
 .........Umm, where should I start......."
To me, the Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice} is...
...sort of like one of the "seven mysteries" of the Ushiromiya family.
You\'ve heard of those, right? Almost all schools have a set of tall tales or ghost stories that get passed down.
Like "on some days, the piano in the music room will start playing by itself", or "the skeleton in the science room dances around at night".
Everyone\'s heard of them.
 But of course, that doesn\'t mean they believe in them.
The stories about {f:5:Beatrice} were the same.
It was just one of those strange tales about our way‐too‐big mansion.
The servants would sometimes talk about seeing things or whatever during their night patrols.
Sometimes, I felt a bit annoyed about them turning my home into a place for ghost stories, but I didn\'t pay it any more attention than that.
 That\'s how little it mattered to me.
So, during my normal, everyday life, I would completely forget about the name "{f:5:Beatrice}".
Of course, when that huge portrait was first hung, I was definitely creeped out.
Even I tried not to meet her eyes after dark,
 so yeah, I don\'t blame the servants for finding it eerie.
But that only lasted for a short while.
I mean, I walked by that portrait every day.
I gradually got used to it, and eventually bored of it.
It was just a portrait that Grandfather blew a bunch of money on, showing the mistress from his delusions... I was past caring.
"I get that.
 I\'ll bet it was different for the other relatives, who only came a few times a year."
"Exactly.
 That\'s why every time the family came for a family conference, they\'d always stand in front of that portrait and talk about {f:5:Beatrice}.
 So, I was reminded of it every year."
"Uu, {f:5:Beatrice}!!
 I\'ve come to play again...!
 I\'ve drawn another new spell.
 Take a look at it later, okay?! Uu!"
"You really do like {f:5:Beatrice}, don\'t you?
 You\'ve been in such high spirits ever since Grandfather had this portrait hung."
"Huh?
 Where\'s Ange?"
"She went back with Aunt Kyrie to take some medicine."
"Ange gets sick so easy.
 ......Totally the opposite of Battler."
"She\'s the sort that gets sick whenever she\'s stressed.
 I also used to get sick on big holidays or days when we were going to the movies."
"Maria\'s really tough by comparison.
 ......She\'s been talking about {f:5:Beatrice} non‐stop since we left Niijima.
 ......Don\'t you think she\'s taking this a bit too far?"
"It\'s not so bad, right?
 It\'s normal for kids to have an active imagination.
 If a kid told you that she\'d met Santa Claus,
 would you tell her she\'s a liar?"
"......Well, of course I wouldn\'t go that far."
Maria kept talking to the portrait as though it was an old friend.
She promised to play with it later, as if she was talking to a living human.
George, a man, seemed to think that this behavior from a younger member of the opposite sex was cute.
......But, to be perfectly frank...
...Jessica, who was the same sex as Maria,
 found this behavior a bit unpleasant regardless of Maria\'s age.
At one time, even I was fascinated by anime heroines and other fictional characters.
However, ......Maria\'s behavior seems to signify something more direct than mere fascination.
 ......It\'s something much more definite,
 ......more vivid.
Am I the only one who notices something odd about her?
......I\'ll bet the others all notice too, but try to ignore it because of that adult dignity George nii‐san is always talking about.
"......My apologies, everyone.
 The head is quite busy with his noble research.
 He wishes to eat lunch in his study today."
Until a second ago, Kinzo\'s children were complaining that eating lunch with their father would give them indigestion.
But now that they knew he wasn\'t coming, they started grumbling about how he should at least spare the time to come down during the annual family conferences.
"Then let us begin lunch, everyone.
 I, Gohda, have made use of all my talent and experience to make sure that all of you,
 who have come from so far away, will be entirely satisfied with your meal..."
No one\'s stomach would fail to rumble after hearing that from the great Chef Gohda.
By the time the splendid dishes were laid out, everyone had stopped talking about Kinzo\'s absence...
It was now Ange\'s absence that was being discussed.
Apparently, her stomachache had gotten so bad that neither she nor Kyrie could make it to lunch.
"Poor thing.
 ......Gohda.
 Make sure you talk to Kyrie‐san later and have some porridge made."
"Thanks a bunch for the concern.
 ......Really sorry about this.
 Seems she just can\'t handle much stress."
"That\'s how it is when they\'re young.
 They\'re cute, at least when they\'re not regurgitatin\'."
"George used to do that all the time.
 He really was frail, way back then.
 Right?"
"Let\'s not talk about the past...
 It\'s not exactly a mealtime topic."
"Uu.
 Poor Ange.
 She doesn\'t get to eat this yummy food?"
"Yeah, poor girl.
 Let\'s make sure we play with her a lot when she gets better."
"Uu, can\'t.
 She can\'t play with me."
"Wh‐what are you talking about?
 Why?"
"Because I\'m gonna play with {f:5:Beatrice}, of course.
 So I can\'t play with Ange."
"Play with {f:5:Beatrice}...
 ......You mean you\'re gonna go off on your own again to mumble to yourself and read some book?"
Jessica slightly regretted that she hadn\'t been more tactful.
However, she couldn\'t wipe away that uncomfortable feeling she got every time Maria talked about {f:5:Beatrice},
 and that feeling slipped out through her words...
"Uu!!
 I don\'t do it on my own!
 Beato is there too!!"
Maria may have been young, but she already knew how to read a person\'s tone.
She immediately burst out in anger, drawing the attention of everyone in the room...
Normally, Rosa would have stopped her at this point.
However, Rosa happened to have gone to the bathroom.
 So, there was no one to calm Maria down...
"Kihihihihi!!
 Poor Jessica, you\'re just a clump of the toxin!
 With Beato\'s weak magical power now, she\'d burn to a crisp if she ever appeared in front of you!
 But she will appear before you eventually.
 Yes, in front of everyone else too!!"
"Kihihihi, and then the door to the Golden Land will open!!
 But who knows if you\'ll be invited in?
 Of course, she will take me there, to the Golden Land!
 But not Jessica, not Jessica!!
 Not someone who makes fun of {f:5:Beatrice}, not an unenlightened, stupid, confused, filthy, toxin‐stained {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}!!
 Kihihihihihihihihihihhihhihhihhi!!"
".........When someone makes fun of {f:5:Beatrice}, it\'s like Maria becomes a totally different person."
"There was a theory about Maria having multiple personalities, wasn\'t there?"
"Multiple personalities!
 Yeah, that probably describes it perfectly.
 Maybe that was Maria\'s idea of her ideal personality."
"You mean that thing about "creating another self", the way you want to be...?"
"Huh? ...How\'d you know my motto?"
"Don\'t think too hard on it.
 You\'ll just get a headache."
That was something Jessica had once told Kanon.
She had been talking about how anyone can create another self that they can really grow to like.
......I think we heard those words somewhere near the beginning of the second game.
Now that I think about it, some very interesting topics have been talked about since very early on...
"Everyone has something they really want to become.
 But they never do it.
 ......The restrictions on their everyday life are what made them who they are today,
 so they have no way of changing themselves."
"True.
 Changing yourself means changing your environment.
 ......That\'s not easy to do."
"So, my idea was to leave "who I am now" unchanged...
...and create another "self" to be the person I want to be."
"You felt suffocated, forced to live the life of a rich family\'s daughter,
 and you thought up a "self" that you wanted to be."
"But I couldn\'t do anything outlandish at home, of course.
 Nothing fun about having Mom yell at me all the time.
 ......So, I made my plan.
 At home, I would obediently do as my parents said,
 ......but I would also create a second "self" to do what I wanted."
"At home, you do everything your parents tell you, and outside, you do what you want.
 That\'s a good way to live.
 You should be proud."
"Heheh, thanks...
 And, well, ......if there\'s something you really want to be, and you really work for it, it\'s easier to do than you\'d think.
 I figured Maria was pretty much the same."
"You think Maria\'s doing the same thing when she gets excited and starts talking and talking?"
"That\'s the person Maria really wants to be,
 is how I think about it sometimes."
"......As the youngest member of the family, she is adored, but not respected."
"Every time she learns something, there\'s always someone in the family who already knows it.
 She doesn\'t get to show off her knowledge about anything.
 ......Whenever she does learn something new, we try to smile and praise her,
 ......but that might actually have hurt her."
"So, Maria wanted to become an authority on something?"
It\'s something that all young boys and girls, who want to shake off their childhood, think.
It\'s not a bad feeling when you learn something new and your parents praise you.
 ......But when you realize that your parents already knew that thing, it sometimes feels like they\'re talking down to you.
When a kid learns their one‐digit times table, their parents will probably praise them.
However, inconsiderate parents will sometimes ask mean questions, like "then what is 11 times 11?"
 or "what is 16 times 16?"
 or something similar.
If that happens, the kid will lose his feeling of accomplishment and start to feel as though he could never surpass his parents...
"So, it\'s easy to guess why Maria got interested in the occult, something no one else knew about,
 and started learning more and more about it.
 ......I think the person Maria wants to be...
is an authority on the occult who is respected by everyone."
"And if she talked about the occult all the time during her everyday life, Rosa\'d smack her.
 ......So, like you, she\'s been hiding this other "self" most of the time."
"That\'s what I think she\'s doing at times like this.
 ......Maybe I should say that this is her real self slipping through the cracks to cover up her normal self."
"Actually, I\'ve had some experience with that myself.
 ......I used to admire the image of a delicate, sheltered lady and wanted to seem more frail......so I\'d pretend to cough a lot, and it sort of became a bad habit."
"Because everyone would be nice to you if you started having coughing fits?"
"Haha, no...... Whenever the conversation turned to something I didn\'t like, or something that made me feel uncomfortable, I could do that to change the subject."
"I see.
 And that\'s another "self" you wanted to become."
"Haha, I\'d appreciate it if you didn\'t tell anyone about that."
Then, ......just what is...
...the "other self" in Maria\'s case?
An authority on the occult who can out‐argue even adults?
Or else, ......someone who converses and mingles with witches?
......Either way, denying {f:5:Beatrice} in front of Maria is clearly taboo.
.........In her search for something more than her everyday life,
 Maria had found it in {f:5:Beatrice} and inside herself.
Then, is going to the Golden Land with {f:5:Beatrice}...
...Maria\'s...wish?
....................................
"Looks like we\'ve gone off track.
 Anyway, Maria kept up that tantrum until Auntie Rosa got back.
 ......It was my fault too, arguing back when I should\'ve let her be."
"And you said there was no way {f:5:Beatrice} could exist?"
"Something like that.
 "If she exists, then just let me see her".
 ......Of course, once Maria started crying, I realized I\'d gone too far."
"And then?"
"At the end of the family conference, I was the only one still upset.
 ......Maria acted as though nothing had happened.
 Instead, she went off somewhere on her own, and came back talking happily about how she had played with {f:5:Beatrice} again."
"Everyone, me included, decided not to contradict her.
 By that time, it was best to just accept it and ignore it."
"Is that all you have to say about the family conference?"
"About the conference, yes.
 What I wanted to talk about was what happened after the conference was over and everyone left."
Even after the conference ended, I still felt a bit uncomfortable.
If Maria had just stayed mad,
 we\'d have made up with each other and I could\'ve put it all behind me.
But since Maria got over it, it felt like I was the only one unsatisfied...
"Oh, Milady.
 Why the gloomy face?"
"......Oh, it\'s you.
 It\'s nothing important.
 ......Did everyone make it back okay?"
"If they\'re still on schedule, they should have reached the Niijima airport by now.
 ......You\'ve done your part well, Milady."
"I haven\'t done anything.
 It\'s you servants who\'ve done a great job."
".....................
 Is the argument you had with Maria‐sama yesterday still playing on your mind?"
"Nn, .........sorta."
"Come now, she\'s just a child.
 It\'s not something you need to worry about, all grown up and in high school."
"That stuff Maria was talking about, do you think it\'s all just a kid\'s nonsense?"
"......About {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama,
 ......you mean?"
"See, even you call her sama."
{f:5:Beatrice} is the name of Grandfather\'s mistress, the person he\'s still infatuated with.
 ......I realize that, as a servant, Kumasawa‐san can\'t speak of her indiscreetly.
Still, ......that\'s now become the name of the fictitious witch who lives in the mansion,
 .........and it\'s almost normal for people to call her "sama".
"{f:5:Beatrice} is just a ghost story created by the adults to stop us from wandering into the forest.
 ......Maria just thought it was interesting one day and decided to pretend it was true."
"Hoh‐hoh‐ho...
 You\'ll end up cursed if you say such things.
 After all, {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama "exists"."
"Come on, we both know that isn\'t true.
 I don\'t need George nii‐san to tell me not to make a fuss about Santa not existing.
 But that doesn\'t mean Santa actually exists."
"......You\'ll find you\'re wrong there, Milady."
"Wrong...?"
"Oh yes.
 The gods do dwell in all things.
 ......In the same way, {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama dwells on this island, in this mansion.
 Like the gods, {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama will do you no harm if you respect her."
"As you say, it is as though she doesn\'t exist...
 However, if you ever fail to show proper respect, it will most certainly come back to haunt you.
 ......Of course, that can be said of more than {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama."
"Heh, if there\'s a curse, let\'s see it.
 I\'d just love to meet her."
"M‐Milady...!
 You mustn\'t say such things...!"
"Ah, Milady..."
"You were splendid today..."
"Shannon, Gohda‐san.
 You guys know about {f:5:Beatrice}, right?"
"......Huh?"
"W‐well, I do know of her, of course.
 ......Why do you ask?"
The two looked at each other.
They looked like a pair who had just heard a clueless person suddenly utter a forbidden word...
"Let\'s have it straight.
 Does she exist?
 That ghost?!"
"......If it\'s a question of whether she exists or not,
 ......I would have to say she doesn\'t...
probably."
"I,
 ......I really do think...
...she does exist."
"And why do you say she "exists"?!
 Have you ever met her?"
"I, ......I\'ve never met her directly, ......but..."
Shannon talked in detail about how she would sometimes feel a strange presence...
or see a silhouette while doing the midnight rounds.
 Jessica dismissed each example as it was given, saying Shannon must have seen it wrong or been mistaken.
"You haven\'t met her either, right, Gohda‐san?!"
"O‐......of course...
 ......However,
 .........well......"
He was being very evasive.
Even a man as big as Gohda was apparently unable to deny the existence of someone he\'d never met.
.........This really didn\'t sit well with Jessica.
She was herself a resident of this mansion.
They were acting as though someone else, someone she didn\'t know, was living here.
 ......Of course she didn\'t like it.
"Nn, wait a sec.
 Tell that one again."
"Huh?
 Y‐you mean...?"
"Th‐the story about the VIP room...?"
Gohda and Shannon had been recounting several ghost stories about {f:5:Beatrice}.
One of those drew a reaction from Jessica...
"Yeah, that one.
 Sounds pretty cool...!"
Gohda and Shannon glanced at each other.
 They hadn\'t been trying to talk about anything "cool".
"The VIP room...
...is never to be entered at two in the morning—
is that the one you mean?"
"The one about how {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama returns to the VIP room at two o\'clock every morning,
 ......so you mustn\'t go near it?"
"Yeah, that\'s it.
 Pretty cool.
 All the other stories are about people saying they heard or saw something they thought was {f:5:Beatrice}, but this one isn\'t.
 This one says that, if you go to the VIP room at two in the morning, you can actually meet {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama...!"
"W‐well, ......I, I wonder......"
"Milady...
 They say that servants who speak ill of {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama will be cursed.
 Furthermore, the VIP room is {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama\'s room..."
"......Even you, Milady, ......should probably reconsider......"
"The VIP room is locked now, right?
 Where\'s the key?"
"Was that key......in the key box...?"
"I, I think Genji‐sama keeps that key by his own chair."
"The master key can open it, right?
 Let me borrow yours."
"I, I cannot do such a thing...!"
"Milady, you mustn\'t approach an ill‐omened place without reason..."
"Hold it, don\'t you go calling my house ill‐omened.
 Anyway, I\'ve made up my mind.
 If you can\'t give me your master key, there\'s still that key for the VIP room, right?
 Let me borrow it."
"............M‐...Milady......"
To Jessica, it was their two expressions that felt more like an ill omen than anything else did.
It wasn\'t the witch or the VIP room that felt foreboding to Jessica.
 It was them, Maria and the others who believed in witches.
In the end, Jessica forced them to agree, and she made them bring her the key to the VIP room...
"A classic test of courage, to see if {f:5:Beatrice} would really appear in the VIP room or not."
"Pretty much.
 ......Still, I wonder why I was so stubborn about it.
 It must have been because of my fight with such a little girl."
......Of course, the weather just had to be terrible on that particular night.
To be honest, I slightly regretted sticking my nose into something so pointless.
But I\'d already said so much, and even borrowed the key from them.
I couldn\'t just go to Shannon the next day, let her ask me how it went,
 and answer "well, I got scared so I gave up,
 tehehe......"
 That\'d just be pathetic.
Normally, I go to sleep long before 2 a.m.
If Mom found me wandering the corridors at that time of night, she\'d definitely yell at me.
So, I waited in my room, staring at the hands of my clock as it ticked closer to 2 a.m.
Outside, the rain was incredible, and the wind strong.
The swaying, rustling trees were particularly creepy.
I\'d complained to Shannon and Gohda about making up ghost stories for my house,
 ......but I was starting to feel as though they had a bit of a place after all.
......The Ushiromiya mansion is huge.
Honestly, I can\'t think of the entire mansion as my own house.
As Mom says, the hallways of the Ushiromiya mansion should be treated like public roads.
In other words, my own room is part of my home, ......but the hallways and the rooms I don\'t usually enter are "outside".
So, while part of me felt that this VIP room ghost story was ridiculous,
 ......the other part of me was so creeped out that it kept trying to convince itself that the first part of me was right.
Ten to two.
If I want to greet 2 a.m. inside the VIP room, I need to have already gone in there before then.
"......Guess it\'s time.
 ......Sorry, but I\'m not giving up that easy."
Nothing\'s going to happen.
 I know that.
It\'ll just be a stupid waste of time for a few minutes.
I touched the doorknob to the door of my room...
...and was startled by how unpleasantly cold it was.
As long as I stayed in this room, I could laugh off anything.
After all, this was my room.
But it wouldn\'t be like that in the hallway.
 ......That\'s...outside my territory.
And the doorknob, the barrier between the two, was ice‐cold...
......Idiot...
 What are you so scared of, me?
You aren\'t taking Shannon\'s, Gohda‐san\'s, ...or maybe Kumasawa‐san\'s gossip seriously, are you...?
I\'ll prove it! There\'s nothing strange in the VIP room...!!
The corridor was only dimly lit.
The hallways were brighter before "lights out".
But to avoid wasting energy or something like that, we kept the lights to a minimum at night.
So, even though I was inside my own house,
 ......it was very obviously the middle of the night here.
......If Mom found out that I was wandering around at a time like this to do a test of courage in the VIP room, which I\'m not supposed to go in,
 I\'d get in a lot of trouble.
To make sure she didn\'t find out, I tried to hide my breathing and my footsteps.
......So, the silence felt unbelievably loud.
Even though it was so quiet, ......the eerie sound of the wind was loud in my ears.
The sound of twigs rustling.
 The sound of some pillar in this old mansion creaking.
What\'s that sound like a beak tapping against glass?
Though it was so quiet, ......all of the little, suspicious sounds felt obnoxiously loud.
Damn, I\'m an idiot.
 Why couldn\'t I have brought a flashlight, at least?
A flashlight to use inside my own home?
......Hah, that\'s even more idiotic...
I mumbled this to myself, hoping it would drown out the sound of the wind just a little...
.........Then, ......I saw it.
 The door to the VIP room.
......The VIP room was supposedly reserved for important guests.
However, as far as I knew, it had never been used.
None of the guests who came to this mansion......had ever been given the right to use this room.
Though I\'d been clutching the key all this time, it didn\'t feel warm at all.
The icy metal tormented me ruthlessly.
Maybe that was a warning.
 ......“If you go back to your comfortable room and hide in your bed, this night will pass like any other...”
"......Like hell I\'m doing that.
 I can\'t give up after coming this far."
The key had been freezing in my hand, urging me to turn back.
......But the keyhole made no further attempt to stop me.
All that\'s left...
......is to turn the knob,
 open the door,
 ......and I\'ll be inside the VIP room.
......It\'s not like I\'ve never been in the VIP room.
Long ago, when I would often play hide‐and‐seek or go exploring,
 this room that I rarely entered had seemed unusual and exciting.
However, I got in trouble for going in, and was told that this room was important, so one mustn\'t enter without reason.
 After that, they made a rule of locking up unused rooms, and I couldn\'t go in anymore.
......So, ...it\'s probably been several years since I last went into the VIP room.
 In fact, ......it might be more than a decade.
The inside of the room is probably different from how it was when I knew of it.
......Come to think of it, even then, I felt that there was something unsettling about this room...
Slowly, I pushed the door open.
It was light, ......and even after I let go of it, it kept opening by itself, as though beckoning me in...
Beyond it......was a darkness as thick and heavy as ink...
Even the dim light that seeped in from the corridor seemed bright in contrast.
......Swallowing hard,
 ......I stuck my head in, feeling about for the light switch next to the doorway.
This was a horribly unnatural and awkward way to do it.
......All I really had to do was step inside and search for the switch from there.
Unwilling to take even a single step into the room,
 ......I timidly stuck just my arm into the darkness and felt along the wall...
"............There..."
Click.
The switch, which was hardly ever used, felt stiff and lifeless.
However, once the light turned on, the darkness vanished in an instant.
And there,
 ......exactly as it had been,
 ......as though not a thing had changed in all these years,
 ...was the VIP room.
......The curtain and bed cover might have been slightly different, and maybe the chairs and the like had changed too.
Still, .........if I had to put it in words, I\'d call it the feel.
......The stiff, lifeless feel of this room hadn\'t changed.
If I hang around here, someone might find me.
 ......I\'d rather not have Mom find me here.
I readied myself,
 ......and though I hadn\'t even been able to bring myself to enter this room with the lights out,
 .........I finally entered.
As soon as I closed the door, I felt an oppressive, suffocating sensation.
Alright, ......I\'ve shut myself in the VIP room.
 Come out, {f:5:Beatrice}.
"......What time is it now...?"
I looked around the room, but I couldn\'t see any clock.
I\'m not in the habit of wearing a watch around the house.
 ......Damn.
 Now I\'m not sure what time it is.
Still, I know it\'s only a few minutes at most.
I tried to suppress my desire to use "going to get a clock" as an excuse to run away from this place...
......Even so, just standing around like this was boring.
When I looked around again, searching for something to sit on, ......I found something strange.
"............What\'s this?"
It had been placed on the side table next to the bed.
......If this room had been used often by someone, I\'d have thought it was just one of their personal belongings.
But there was no one living in this room.
So, ......it was impossible for this to belong to the room\'s owner.
"......What is this, an offering or something?
 ......Creepy..."
It did look like an offering.
A small French doll was sitting on the side table.
The doll\'s hair...was gold.
 ......It was wearing a black dress.
Just who managed to find this doll, and where?
There\'s no doubt that someone placed the doll here to symbolize {f:5:Beatrice}.
Does that mean...this doll is supposed to be the owner of this room, or something...?
And, as though it was an offering to that owner,
 ......there sat a small plate with several cookies and wrapped chocolates.
It was all set out neatly, and there was no dust piled up on the doll.
......In other words, both the doll and the offering were being taken care of on a regular basis by the servants,
 and kept in good condition along with the rest of the room.
Taken care of?
 ......No, it was more than that.
It looked like an offering...no, like some sort of worship,
 a prayer saying "please don\'t curse us"...
......So, while the doll was eerie enough by itself,
 ......psychologically, it was even more unnerving to think about how it must have been kept safe and worshiped in a place like this.
"Stupid.
 ......Am I supposed to clap my hands together and say "please don\'t curse me"?"
Jessica forced herself to look away from the bizarre doll.
......She couldn\'t bring herself to sit on a bed that wasn\'t hers.
Then again, she didn\'t really feel like sitting down on a chair either.
She had lost any desire to sit on anything in this room.
Wandering about aimlessly,
 ......I peeked out the window through the gaps in the curtains to stare at the dark, rainy night.
......What the hell am I doing?
Hanging about in the VIP room this late just because that fight with Maria is still eating at me...
 ......This is beyond stupid... I\'m disappointed in myself.
 {f:5:Beatrice}, huh...
Just when did that strange witch start living in this mansion...?
......Grandfather\'s always yelling about {f:5:Beatrice}.
Since it\'s apparently the name of his dead mistress, people started talking about how her ghost must haunt this mansion.
There\'s that kids\' horror story about the witch in the forest,
 which might be a ghost story made by the adults to stop the kids from going in there.
The portrait Grandfather had hung in April was really striking.
And there was also that weird epitaph.
 ......The creepy words on that, which sounded like some sort of ritual with human sacrifices, made the name of {f:5:Beatrice} seem all the more unnerving.
At some point, those stories mixed together, and they now say that the witch {f:5:Beatrice} exists.
......I don\'t believe in {f:5:Beatrice}...
because I know she\'s just a fictional person made by the fusion of a few horror stories.
The "Beatrice" who was Grandfather\'s mistress probably did exist.
But she wasn\'t a witch.
The story of the witch of the forest was made up by the adults to prevent their kids from getting lost in the woods.
 But that was just a made‐up story, not reality.
In fact, I\'ve heard that kids were once threatened about wolves living in the forest.
 Apparently, the kids realized that wolves couldn\'t exist on the island, so it was changed to the witch.
When the portrait was hung,
 ......that once‐vague character suddenly had a face,
 and people acted as though she\'d been around since long ago.
......That\'s right, it\'s all a ghost story someone made, a fiction.
And Maria calls {f:5:Beatrice} her best friend, and the servants worship her like a household shrine.
I just don\'t get it, and it creeps me out......
".........! ..........................."
The sudden ring of the phone made me jump so hard I thought my heart would explode.
There was a phone on the bedside table across from the one with the doll,
 and it was ringing noisily.
However, I was only surprised by the first ring.
By the time it had rung three times, I\'d regained my cool enough to grumble about this being a prank done by someone trying to scare me.
......If I rush to pick it up, I\'ll probably hear someone laughing at me, saying "were you scared?"
I thought about ignoring it instead, .........but it kept on ringing incessantly.
It\'s a pretty loud sound to have going on and on this late at night.
 If Mom somehow manages to hear it from her room, I\'m screwed.
"......Okay, okay, I\'ve got it, I\'ve got it.
 Might as well say "ya scared me" or whatever..."
I decided to pick up the receiver.
I\'ll just say "that surprised me, wahahaha",
 and maybe follow that up with "looks like {f:5:Beatrice} didn\'t show up after all".
After all, this is my victory, in a sense.
".........Hello?"
‘Uu!
 Hi, {f:5:Beatrice}...!’
"Huh?
 M‐......Maria...?!"
I don\'t get it.
Did I hear that wrong...?
 Why would Maria be calling here...?!
"H‐hello...?!"
‘Thanks for teaching me that fun song last time.
 In return, I\'m gonna sing you a song, {f:5:Beatrice}.
 I just learned this one!
 Uu!’
The voice, the intonation, the manner of speech—all of it clearly belonged to Maria.
But......what\'s she talking about, all by herself...?
Maria just kept on talking happily as I stood there, stunned and unable to interrupt.
Eventually, Maria started singing an old, familiar kids\' song that even I knew.
I don\'t...get it.
"......Maria? Hello...?
 Wait a sec, stop singing...!
 What\'s going on?
 I don\'t get it...!
 Hello?!
 Ah—"
The voice, the lights—everything disappeared.
In the pitch‐black, I couldn\'t see anything, couldn\'t tell what was happening.
I don\'t get it, what\'s going on?!
"What...
.........the hell...
.........was that......?"
Does being in darkness really slow us humans down so much...?
I know it\'s dark, ......but I really do have absolutely no idea what just happened.
......What was that shuffling sound just now?
 I, I\'m not sure... I can\'t explain it.
It was a loud sound like someone crawling out of bed.
I wouldn\'t say something as non‐committal as I "felt like" I heard it.
 I wouldn\'t say something as vague as I "sensed a presence".
 I definitely heard it, right next to me, clearly.
However, there was no change to the bed.
No one had been sleeping there in the first place, and the sheets were still perfectly straight.
Someone had crawled out of the bed,
 .........and had laughed in a creepy voice before leaving the room......
 ............That\'s...
...what it felt like.
Felt like?
 I\'m here, and the bed\'s right there.
I\'m not only in the same room, I\'m right next to it.
 ......So, why am I so unsure about what happened just a few seconds ago?!
I gripped the receiver, which had gone completely silent,
 .........and waited there alone, unable to move, in a quiet room that seemed exactly identical to the one I had first entered...
............Huh?
 ............What............?
If nothing had changed since the beginning, ......I could just pretend that the last minute or so didn\'t happen.
However,
 ......if something had changed,
 ......that would be proof that something really did happen...
"......The hell?
 ......Where\'d...
......it go......?"
Did it fall to the floor...?
 No, it\'s not there.
 ......No matter where I look, from whatever angle, ......it\'s not there.
Though the offering plate with the cookies and chocolate is still here,
 .........the thing they were being offered to,
 the doll, is gone.
"......No way.................."
Then, ......what just happened......?
Is the {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama doll supposed to have cackled out loud and left the room...?
No, that crawling sound was too loud to have been made by a doll.
It was a noisy sort of sound, like a kid playing with a blanket and using it as a cape.
Then, what......?
Is that {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama doll...
supposed to have turned into a human...
......and then run cackling from the room...?
"No......way....................."
After that, nothing happened.
The doll alone disappeared, .........and nothing else changed.
In a VIP room that had remained completely unchanged and was filled only with the sound of wind and rain,
 ......I stood there, too shocked to move......
"Did you ever find that doll?"
"......I looked everywhere, even under the bed.
 I literally crawled in there looking for it.
 ......But I didn\'t find it."
"Just what do you think happened in that room?"
"I don\'t think it was actually "{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama\'s curse".
 ......It might have been a prank done by the servants."
"A prank?"
"Maybe they recorded Maria\'s voice on a cassette tape or something ahead of time.
 They then called at exactly 2 a.m. and pushed the play button.
 They could\'ve cut the power at the breaker or something."
"......Then, someone who had been hiding in the VIP room beforehand would make a creepy laugh, take the doll, and leave.
 .........If that was how it happened, everything does fit."
"Doesn\'t sound like you\'re really convinced it happened that way."
"Can you blame me?
 ......I mean, if that was just a prank to scare me, it was way too elaborate."
They made Maria sing beforehand and recorded it.
Then, someone called the VIP room and replayed that recording.
Then, someone waited until exactly the right time and tripped the breaker for the VIP room.
To turn off the power to the VIP room, you\'d have to go down to the basement.
 ......There\'s a breaker box down in the boiler room.
There\'s no phone line down there, so you\'d need a different person to play back Maria\'s tape.
And you\'d need another person to hide in the VIP room and cackle before leaving.
And......just how long would this last person have to hide in the VIP room beforehand...?
How long would they have to hide in the pitch‐black VIP room—under the bed, for example—
waiting to scare Jessica, who might or might not come...?
"......There\'s no way it could be a witch\'s curse.
 ......But still.
 Imagining that so many people planned everything down to the slightest detail...
and waited for several hours in the darkness just to scare me...?
 To me, that\'s even creepier......"
"I agree.
 I\'d much prefer a curse.
 ......Did you ask the servants about that later on?"
"What\'s the point? They\'d just play dumb, of course.
 ......And there had to have been at least three of them...
 On that day, only Genji‐san, Gohda‐san, Kumasawa‐san, and Shannon stayed the night.
 So three of those four helped out with that creepy prank?
 It doesn\'t make sense...!
 That\'s why......I couldn\'t ask about it."
".............................."
True, it had been a strange experience for her, but it wasn\'t something completely impossible for humans to do.
......Even so, it really must have been more unnerving to imagine a large number of people planning so carefully just to scare Jessica.
......It\'s no surprise that she found this scarier than {f:5:Beatrice}\'s curse.
"Do you still believe the servants pulled a fast one on you?"
".........No.
 I probably......just freaked out and mistook what I saw and heard.
 The doll probably just fell somewhere, and I just had trouble finding it."
"Are you trying to say you imagined the whole thing...?"
"Other than the doll disappearing, there was no other proof that anything had changed.
 ......Later on, I talked to Maria, and she said she didn\'t know anything about that song or the phone call.
 I don\'t know if she was lying or not, of course.
 ......Anyway, what happened that night...
...is just something I thought happened...
...and there\'s no proof of any kind."
"That\'s ironic.
 Even if you had met {f:5:Beatrice} directly, you wouldn\'t have been able to prove that either."
"For a while, I was pretty rattled about it, ......but as time went on,
 I began to think that lightning or something had shut off the power for a second and spooked me,
 ......and maybe one of the trees in the garden fell while making rustling sounds, which I mistook for someone crawling out of bed because I was already scared."
"And the laugh?"
"Maybe some strange bird.
 ......Anyway, I might have misheard something to get that sound..."
".........I act tough, but it turns out I\'m actually an unbelievable coward.
 ...That\'s why I let my imagination get ahold of me.
 ......I decided to think about it that way......and kept firmly repeating it to myself to help me forget everything that happened that night."
"So it all remains in darkness..."
".........People are actually pretty good at forgetting things if they try.
 ......Ever since that night, I feel uncomfortable every time I hear the word "{f:5:Beatrice}".
 But I try hard to not let it show on my face."
"...................................."
"............That\'s all.
 I can\'t tell you any more than that."
"It\'s really embarrassing, so please don\'t tell anyone.
 .........I don\'t want them knowing what a huge chicken I was."
"You got it.
 ......I have one last question."
"About the VIP room?"
"No.
 About the dining hall."
"The dining hall?"
"On the day of the family conference, just before your ghost story, all of the relatives were gathered in the dining hall, right?"
"Yeah.
 Except Battler hadn\'t come back to the family yet.
 Everyone else was there.
 ......Everyone except Grandfather, of course."
"And Ange wasn\'t in the room because of her stomachache.
 ......Her seat was next to yours, wasn\'t it?"
"Yep."
"Was that the seat to your right?"
"Yeah, the seat to my right.
 Why does it matter?
 ...............?
 ......Hm?
 Wait...
 ......That\'s strange, why to the......?"
"That\'s enough.
 ......Try not to think. You\'ll just get a headache."
"What\'s up, Jessica?
 Why the confused look...?"
"......Well, uh...
......right...
...left...
 .........???"
"Hahah, you\'re so weird.
 How is it going, Will?
 Have George nii‐san and Jessica told you anything useful?"
"A bit.
 That ghost story about {f:5:Beatrice} was pretty fun."
"Ghost story?
 What are you talking about?"
"The one about {f:5:Beatrice}\'s ghost appearing in the VIP room at two in the morning.
 Pretty scary story."
"I\'ve never heard of that.
 ......I don\'t know who put that out there, but that\'d be really rude, making up ghost stories about the woman our head is indebted to."
"A model answer.
 ........................"
".........?
 What?"
"Do you know about the epitaph, Lion?"
"Epitaph?
 What epitaph?"
"That epitaph by {f:5:Beatrice}\'s portrait."
".........My apologies,
 but I have no idea what you mean."
"‘Behold the sweetfish river, running through my beloved home of old’."
".........Just what...
are you talking about?"
"So, in your world, ......no, in this world,
 the portrait exists, but not the epitaph?"
"Of course, I know about the large portrait of Beatrice hanging in the entrance hall.
 ......But I haven\'t heard of this epitaph.
 What is it?"
"........................
 ......That\'s a very interesting difference.
 .........You\'ve lived on Rokkenjima all your life, right?"
"Of course.
 What\'s your point?"
"When you were a little kid, you were warned not to go near the woods."
"Yes.
 They always said to stay away, since it would be dangerous if we got lost."
"Because a witch lives in the forest?"
"A witch?
 What witch?"
"The Golden Witch, ruler of Rokkenjima\'s night.
 {f:5:Beatrice}."
"......Beatrice is a woman to whom Grandfather owes a great debt.
 Don\'t you think it\'s a bit rude to treat her like a witch or a ghost?"
"...............You don\'t know about the witch {f:5:Beatrice}?"
"I know about the Beatrice who came here in a submarine along with the gold, and about her daughter, who was raised in the hidden mansion.
 We just learned about those two together a short while ago, right?
 Where does a witch come in?"
"...........................
 I see, so that\'s it.
 ......Then how did they scare you...to keep you from going into the woods?"
"They said that wolves lived in the forest."
".........Not a witch,
 ...but wolves.
 ......Of course.
 Very interesting."
"It isn\'t interesting to me.
 What are you talking about?
 What is this witch?"
"I\'m just talking to myself.
 I have one more question."
"Please, go ahead."
"During the family conference, who sits to your right at the dining table?"
"My little sister, Jessica, sits across from me.
 The next in rank is Aunt Eva\'s son.
 So, George nii‐san is the one on my right... What\'s your point?"
"I get it.
 ......It\'s all mashed together in a confusing mess.
 But it is interesting."
"Well, I don\'t have a clue."
