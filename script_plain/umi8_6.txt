"The day after Christmas isn\'t Christmas.
 It couldn\'t happen."
"Heheheh.
 Too bad. Wrong."
"Huh? Why...?!"
"Ange‐chan, what time of day does a new day start?"
"Midnight, 0:00."
"There you go.
 At midnight, isn\'t it night outside?"
"......Ah!"
I see.
 The first night was just after midnight on December 25th.
In other words, the time right after the previous day ended and Christmas began.
That would indeed be Christmas Day, and it would be at night.
"And then, the morning of the 25th would come, and when the sun sank again, that would be nighttime on the 25th again......"
"Exactly!
 You figured it out."
"Hohoho!
 If only you had figured it out a little faster."
Grandfather laughed like Santa Claus.
Auntie Eva asked him to count it as a right answer, since I figured it out in the end, but Grandfather shook his head.
"Come on...!
 Don\'t be such a stingy Grandpa."
"Still, now I\'ve figured out how to do it.
 I\'ll get the next one right."
"Yes, yes.
 That\'s the spirit.
 That\'s my granddaughter for you."
"Thank you, Grandpa!
 I\'m really ready now.
 I\'ll start getting a lot of them right!"
"Yes.
 Give it your all.
 I have a truly splendid present waiting for you."
After bowing to Grandfather, I hurried off with Auntie Eva to where everyone else was gathered.
"Oh, I see.
 It is possible...!"
"Yep, that\'s right.
 After all, there are two nights in every day."
"Right!
 December 25th starts at 0:00 midnight.
 Midnight is during the night, so that\'s the first night.
 Then, morning comes, and when night falls again, it\'s still the same day until midnight!"
"Exactly.
 And both of those nights are nights on Christmas Day."
"Eheheheheh.
 Am I awesome? Am I awesome...?!"
With a delighted smile, Auntie Eva patted my head vigorously.
"Wahahaha!
 Well done, Ange.
 I tried to make it a hard question, but you solved it like it was nothing."
"Congratulations, Ange‐sama.
 ......Here is a medal for getting the first question right."
Genji‐san held out a gold‐colored medal.
Grandfather smiled at me, urging me to take it.
"Th‐thank you!"
"Keep up the pace.
 Well now, that is all for my puzzle.
 Head over there and ask whomever you choose for a quiz."
It was a heavy, gold‐colored medal.
If I get a lot of these right, my pocket might burst.
I\'m gonna get so many that I can brag about it to everyone!
After bowing to Grandfather,
 I hurried off with Auntie Eva to where everyone else was gathered.
As Ange ran off,
 Kinzo watched her go with a warm gaze.
"Did I make it a bit too easy...?"
"No.
 I think it was just right."
"............Genji.
 Have I...managed to act the part of a good grandpa...?"
"Of course."
"Ange is young.
 And, she frequently grows sick and is unable to come to Rokkenjima.
 ......She probably won\'t...remember me well."
Young children have their own kind of cruelty.
They think of kindness as something they will naturally receive.
And because they think of kindness as only natural, ......they forget about it quickly.
".........It is no different from gratitude to one\'s parents.
 It will probably take Ange‐sama many years before she understands."
"Do you think...
......that she will eventually remember that I was a fun grandpa?"
"......Yes.
 I am certain of it."
"...................................."
Kinzo\'s expression grew slightly darker.
......Eventually, even Ange will get older, and she will probably hear how the public at large regards Ushiromiya Kinzo.
The Ushiromiya Kinzo known by the public is completely different from the Kinzo who plays with his grandchildren.
When she learns,
 ......will Ange remember the face of Kinzo the tyrant, known of by the world, ...or that gently smiling face?
".........If possible, I would hope for her to remember my smile, ......but such a thing is probably too much to ask for."
"................................."
"There\'s no way around it.
 That\'s what children are."
"Oh, it\'s you."
"Children just eat up kindness, and it never remains in their memories.
 By the time twelve years have passed, she will surely learn what a bizarre eccentric Ushiromiya Kinzo was.
 Your smile is fated to be painted over by that and forgotten."
".........Most probably.
 No matter how much I spoil her, my love will not be rewarded."
"However,
 just as it takes a long time to remember what you owe your parents,
 ......Ange will surely remember someday.
 ......She will remember the smiles you showed her."
"Hmph......
 Let her forget.
 One smile from her is the greatest parting gift I could ever take with me, when my time comes.
 This is...the essence of unrewarded love."
"I guess grandfathers are always unrewarded."
"Oh, but I have been rewarded.
 With Ange\'s smile just now to look back upon,
 I could happily pass on in my sleep tonight.
 Wahhahahahahahahaha......"
With a lonely laugh, Kinzo spun around, setting his cloak fluttering.
This was all the love he could offer Ange as a grandfather.
Part of him wanted to be remembered, but he knew he mustn\'t wish for that.
That was...how unrewarded love worked.
After looking at Kinzo\'s back, Beato stared at Ange\'s back again.
"............Ange.
 ......Even so, please remember it someday.
 ......Remember the smile...that Kinzo once showed you."
Okay, whose quiz should I take next?
I\'m gonna challenge more and more people, get more and more medals for getting them right, and get a wonderful present to show everyone.
Uncle Krauss and Auntie Natsuhi are over there.
They\'re looking this way and smiling.
 I\'m sure they\'ve thought up some interesting puzzles.
There\'s Uncle Hideyoshi, beckoning for me to come over.
He\'s a fun uncle, so I\'m sure he\'s thought up a fun question.
Behind him are Mom and Dad.
They\'re waving at me, telling me to have lots of fun.
......Dad probably knows a lot of really hard questions.
 He might be tough.
Over there is Auntie Rosa and Maria onee‐chan.
It looks like they\'re reading a quiz book together, searching for a problem.
Every now and then, Maria onee‐chan glances over at me, saying "kihihihihi".
She can be mean sometimes, so I\'m sure her puzzle won\'t be a nice one.
Beyond them are Battler onii‐chan, George onii‐chan, and Jessica onee‐chan.
......Battler onii‐chan is usually nice,
 but he sometimes says really mean things, and I think he likes seeing me get confused.
......I get the feeling...
that he\'ll give me a really tough problem.
Is there anyone who looks like they won\'t be mean?
If I can, I\'d like to start with some easy puzzles to warm me up.
All the way over there are Genji‐san and Doctor Nanjo.
I don\'t think those two will be mean to me.
And then there\'s Shannon and Kanon.
Shannon knows about a lot of quizzes and fairy tales.
 I\'m sure she\'ll give me something unique.
Then, we have Gohda‐san and Kumasawa‐san, who are serving tea.
Kumasawa‐san might be tough.
 ......I kinda think she\'ll give me a really confusing problem.
......It looks like everyone might be pretty tough.
Hmmmmm.........
"Ange‐chan.
 I\'ve got a good one for ya...!
 Over here!"
Uncle Hideyoshi is calling for me.
......What should I do?
 Should I go?
"Do you want to try Uncle Hideyoshi?"
"Yeah.
 The order doesn\'t matter.
 After all, I\'m gonna challenge everyone."
I rolled up my sleeves and headed towards Uncle Hideyoshi.
"Wahahahahahaha, that\'s the way.
 Mine\'s a tricky one, okay?"
"I wonder what sort of question you\'ll give her.
 Don\'t make it too hard, okay?"
"It\'s okay if it\'s hard.
 I\'ll solve it."
"Oooh, lookin\' pretty confident there...!
 Okay, here it comes!"
After clearing his throat, Uncle Hideyoshi started telling his question...
"Mine\'s a riddle.
 Listen closely, now.
 You know the story of Momotarou, right?"
"The boy who floated down a river in a peach?"
"That\'s right.
 But you know, one day, an apple floated down that river."
"An apple??"
"Yep!
 And the next day, a butternut squash floated down it!"
"I hate butternut squash."
"And then, the next day, a cabbage floated down it!
 And the next day, a dill pickle did.
 And the next day, an eggplant floated by.
 And the day after that, a fig did!"
"*giggle*.
 What a strange tale.
 Did a greengrocer live upstream, or something?"
"Okay, here\'s the question.
 What floated down the river the next day?!"
"Huh...?!"
"I\'ve got it.
 Do you get it, Ange‐chan?"
"I don\'t get it."
"Then I\'ll give you a hint.
 There\'s an order to the things that float down the river.
 Can you guess what order they\'re in?"
"Wahahahaha!
 What a huge hint...!"
".........I don\'t...have a clue!"
"Wahhahahahahahahaha.
 Guess that was a bit too hard...!"
"I know what floated down the river the day after that.
 A hassaku orange, right?"
"Yep.
 And the day after that, it was probably an i.........i...hmmm...
 ......I can\'t think of a veggie that starts with "i"!"
I don\'t really get it.
 Hmm... oh well.
"I know!
 It\'s a grapefruit!"
"That\'s right.
 It wasn\'t one of the choices, but green beans would have worked too."
The names all followed the alphabet.
 Apple was "a".
 Butternut squash was "b".
 Cabbage was "c".
It kept going with "d", "e", and "f".
So, after "f" comes "g".
 That\'s why the answer had to be something that started with "g".
"Thanks, Auntie Eva. I got it right thanks to your hint!"
"*giggle*.
 You solved it by yourself, Ange‐chan.
 Incredible."
"Yep, nice work!
 Now, here\'s your medal for gettin\' it right...!"
Hideyoshi took out a gold‐colored medal and placed it on my palm.
It felt heavy in my hand.
 Yeah, this is what victory feels like.
I\'d better keep it up!
"I\'ve actually got one more medal here, I guess for me to give in place of Eva.
 But I can\'t think of any more problems."
"Then maybe I should give Ange‐chan a puzzle."
"Huh?
 You will?"
"Sure.
 A quiz for the princess from her attendant♪
 I\'ve thought of a fun one, so please, have a go at it!"
Auntie Eva smiled brightly.
I want to get as many medals as possible, so of course, I want as many chances as I can get.
"Okay, I\'ll have a go at it."
"*giggle*. That\'s the spirit.
 Okay, here it comes."
"We\'ve talked about how I love to travel, haven\'t we?"
"Yeah.
 You said you like traveling overseas a lot."
"That\'s right.
 So this will be a puzzle about traveling.
 There was a traveler in a certain place."
"A traveler?"
"First, the traveler walked five kilometers north."
"......Should I write this down on a piece of paper?"
"Don\'t worry.
 The puzzle isn\'t that hard, so listening to it will be enough."
"The traveler first walked five kilometers north.
 Then, he walked five kilometers to the east.
 Then, he walked five kilometers to the south."
"............Five kilometers north.
 Five kilometers east.
 Five kilometers south.
 ......You mean, like a blocky "n"?"
"That\'s right!
 You work it out, and he\'s in a spot five kilometers to the east of where he started."
"That should be the case, right?
 But, incredibly, this traveler ended up in the exact same spot he started.
 ......Is something so mysterious possible?"
"Wahaha, there\'s no way!
 His compass must\'ve gone crazy."
"Of course it didn\'t!
 Eheheheheh, do you know, Ange‐chan?"
"It wasn\'t because of his compass?
 ......Is this a play on words?"
"No, this is a real quiz.
 For a hint, why don\'t you try thinking about a globe?"
"............I don\'t get it."
I\'ve never traveled overseas at all.
There might be some strange place in the world where you could walk in a blocky "n" and get back to where you started.
......Like the Bermuda Triangle, or something...
"Hmmm......
 I guess that was a bit too hard for you, Ange‐chan."
"If you went north, then east, then south, there\'s no way you\'d get back to where you started."
"But there is a place.
 A place somewhere on the Earth\'s surface.
 If you have a globe in your house, take a good look at it and think carefully.
 If you just can\'t figure it out, try asking your dad, okay?"
"Okay, I\'ll ask him.
 So tell me the right answer...!"
"*giggle*.
 The right answer is a ve~ry cold place.
 Where can you find cold places on a globe?
 Think about it carefully.
 Once you figure it out, you can try giving this quiz to the other kids in your class.
 I\'m sure they\'ll all be surprised."
Where can you find a cold place?
 ......Hokkaido?
I don\'t think you end up at the start if you go north, east, then south in Hokkaido.
......Nnnngh.
 I don\'t get it.
 I give up.
"Okay, that\'s all for our puzzles!
 Go ask one of the others to give you one!"
"Let\'s go!
 Who should we challenge next?!"
If Auntie Eva knows puzzles this hard, I\'m sure she must be good at quizzes.
If she\'s with me, I know we\'ll get lots and lots of medals.
Who will I ask next...?!
"I got it...!
 It\'s a really cold place!
 Yeah, it must be super cold there!"
"Perfect!
 Ange‐chan, you must really be a genius, to get something like that at your age."
"If you start at the south pole, then after you go north, going east just draws a circle around the south pole.
 So, anytime you go south again, that just takes you right back to the south pole."
"I tried to make it an extra hard puzzle,
 but Ange‐chan was just too good."
"Congrats!
 Here\'s another medal for ya."
I got a heavy, gold‐colored medal.
All right, I did it...!
 Auntie Eva and I held up our fists in celebration.
"Okay, that\'s all for our puzzles!
 Go ask one of the others to give you one!"
"Okay! Thank you, Uncle Hideyoshi...!"
"Your auntie\'s really clever...!
 ......With the two of you together, you\'ll be gettin\' medals right and left!"
"Yep, that\'s right!"
"Yeah.
 Let\'s do our best together, Auntie Eva."
I dashed away.
Who will I ask next...?!
Uncle Hideyoshi waved goodbye, smiling......
Hideyoshi and Eva watched as Ange ran off happily,
 looking for the next quiz.
".........That kid can wear such a cute smile,
 ......and I......will be the one who takes it away from her..."
"Eva..............."
Eva hung her head.
 A single tear sparkled in her eye...
"Her reaction was only natural, considering how she felt.
 ......But I...wasn\'t able to see past it and accept her feelings......"
"It can\'t be helped.
 You\'re as human as anyone else.
 It\'s not easy to put your emotions aside."
"Even so, it was my fault...!
 After all, I already had the experience of bringing up a child, right?!
 .........I should have become her mother.
 ......And yet, I let sadness overwhelm me, ......and I didn\'t do it at all..."
"It can\'t be helped, I tell you...!
 Don\'t think you were the only one at fault...!
 You shouldn\'t blame yourself so much!"
By now, Eva was unable to hold back her sobs...
Large tears dripped down her cheeks as she stared at the ground and shook...
"What a sin I\'ve committed......
 .........My sadness was no greater than hers...!
 And yet, I decided that I was suffering the most, ......so I didn\'t accept her feelings......
 .........I\'m a failure of a mother...
 I wasn\'t able.........to become a mother for her........."
"That\'s wrong.
 ......You did your best for her, Eva nee‐san."
"Kyrie‐san..."
Kyrie and Rudolf were standing behind Eva now.
"I know how hard you tried to get along with Ange."
"......You held out well, Aneki.
 Guess that daughter of ours really has been a pain, clueless about how much you suffered."
After the accident on Rokkenjima...
...Eva, the only person to leave Rokkenjima alive, adopted Ange, the girl who had survived the day through her absence.
......While they would eventually develop a sad and mutually painful relationship,
 it wasn\'t like that at first.
As Ange\'s new mother and last remaining blood relative, Eva tried to shower her with love and affection.
 Even as she fought back the sadness she herself felt.
However, Ange wasn\'t able to accept that kindness.
She lashed out at Eva, the only one who had returned alive, and accused her of stealing her parents away from her.
......Eva, understanding the wounds that this little six‐year‐old girl bore, withstood these attacks.
She grit her teeth and gave Ange her unconditional love.
However, .........the wounds that Eva herself bore were also extremely deep.
She was never rewarded for her sad efforts,
 ............and the future that followed was a sorrowful one.
"You tried to show Ange the same affection you once showed George‐kun."
"But in the end, ......that was just for my own satisfaction...... Ange‐chan never felt any of it..."
"Ange was the one who couldn\'t accept it.
 It isn\'t your fault."
"But who could possibly ask that of Ange‐chan when she was just six years old...?!
 I should\'ve held out much, much longer, until she could understand my feelings...!"
"Eva nee‐san.
 If nothing else, trust me when I say this..."
"..........................."
"We......don\'t blame you in the slightest."
"......Kyrie‐san..............."
"Thank you so much for suffering so long for Ange\'s sake......
 .........If that kid has a human heart, then I\'m sure she\'ll recognize the affection you showed her someday."
"Thank you, Aneki.
 We\'ll always be grateful......"
"............Isn\'t that wonderful, Eva......?
 ......All of your efforts......have been witnessed......"
"Uuuhghuu......uuuuuhhghuu........."
"How are you doing, Ange‐sama?
 If you wish, I, Gohda, would be pleased to challenge you."
"Hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho.
 And I, Kumasawa, have a ve~ry tricky puzzle for you."
"It doesn\'t matter how hard it is.
 I\'m not alone.
 I\'ll solve it with Auntie Eva!"
Gohda and Kumasawa offered to challenge me.
I\'ll have to go up against everyone in the end, so it doesn\'t matter who comes next.
I waved at Auntie Eva to hurry up,
 and she ran toward me.
"So, we\'re challenging this pair next?
 Who will we start with?"
"Okay...Gohda‐san."
"Very well, as you wish.
 Here is my puzzle."
"Hohhohohoho.
 I\'ll warn you, it\'s a toughie."
"I\'ll still solve it.
 I\'ve gotten the knack of it."
"You\'d better not underestimate Ange‐chan.
 Right?!"
"Right!"
"My, my.
 ...Well then, being the humble chef that I am, here is a puzzle about food and the kitchen."
"We\'ll fight together this time.
 If you don\'t get it, just ask me to lend a hand.
 I\'ll give you a hint."
"......If I get a hint, does that mean I don\'t get a medal?"
"It won\'t affect your medals at all, so feel free to ask away!"
"I\'ve got it.
 The hint here...is that the witch got home much later than usual."
"......What happens when she gets home later than usual?"
"Think carefully.
 The food is always freshly made at the usual time, right?
 So, ......what happens when she gets home long after that?"
".........I don\'t get it.
 Food isn\'t supposed to talk."
"Well, uh, that\'s because this is a fairy tale puzzle......"
"Hohhohohohohoho...
 It looks as though she didn\'t figure it out."
The answer I\'d chosen at random was wrong, apparently.
 ......Too bad.
"Okay, tell me the right answer.
 You figured it out, right, Auntie Eva?
 Tell me!"
"Alright.
 The answer is—"
"Eva‐sama, if you wouldn\'t mind...!
 They say recipes and riddle answers are best while they remain secret."
"You think so...?
 Eheheh, I\'ll have to tell her sometime later when you aren\'t around, then."
"Yeah, it\'s a promise!"
But even if I hear the answer later on, I still got it wrong.
Oh well.
 I\'d better pull myself together and take a shot at Kumasawa‐san\'s puzzle.
"The ice cream!
 The witch got back really late, so the ice cream would\'ve melted.
 So she couldn\'t eat it!"
"Nicely done!
 See?
 Ange‐chan is a clever girl, isn\'t she?"
"Congratulations, Ange‐sama!
 Very impressive.
 How quickly you saw through the puzzle that I, Gohda, put all my efforts into...!"
"It was totally easy.
 Auntie Eva\'s puzzle was harder."
"*giggle*, thanks."
"Congratulations.
 This medal is your prize for answering my question correctly."
"Thank you!"
Alright, that was easy.
Now let\'s take a shot at Kumasawa‐san\'s puzzle.
"Looks like I\'m up next.
 Now, let\'s test Ange‐sama with my specially‐made, super‐hard puzzle.
 Are you ready?"
"It\'s hard?
 How hard?"
"Hohhohohohohoho.
 You\'ll have to wait and see.
 And now, let the mackerel dessert puzzle begin."
"Mackerel dessert...?"
"This is Kumasawa‐san we\'re talking about, so you can bet it\'ll be a strange one.
 Be careful."
"Okay!"
"Auntie Eva, do you get it?"
"She says you have to change one letter, so the answer\'s probably some sort of word game.
 We have to change one letter in "sabara" and see if we can make it into a des—
ah, I\'ve got it!"
"Huh?!
 What is it? What is it?!"
"Try using each of the letters in place of the "b".
 In fact, that pretty much gives you the answer."
"Bzzzzt.
 Wronnng."
"Huh?!
 I don\'t get it!
 I don\'t get it at all...!"
"Hohhohohoho, sorry, but wrong is wrong.
 Perhaps it was a bit too hard for you, Ange‐sama."
"Come on, Kumasawa‐san.
 That was a nasty puzzle..."
"It doesn\'t make sense!
 There\'s no way you could make a dessert out of mackerel!
 What\'s the answer?
 Tell me!"
"Hohohoho, it\'s no fun if I tell you.
 If you don\'t guess it quick, ......then you really will be having mackerel for dessert.
 Ihihihihihihihihihi......"
"Tell me, tell me!"
"Nope."
Kumasawa smiled cheerily, but remained stubborn.
No matter how much I bother her, she probably won\'t tell me the answer.
"That concludes our puzzles.
 There are probably others waiting for you to challenge them, Ange‐sama.
 Please, on to the next challenge."
"We\'re both rooting for you, Ange‐sama."
"Okay!
 I\'ll keep on trying hard and getting more and more medals!"
"That\'s the spirit. Don\'t let it get you down.
 Plenty more chances left!"
We rushed away.
Okay, who should we take on next...?!
"I got it!
 The new letter is "h"!
 If you change the "b" in Sabara to an "h", you get Sahara!"
"Hohhohohohoho,
 that\'s correct."
"The Sahara is a desert,
 and the last line said you could make a great "desert" out of sabara!"
"I figured out a trick in Japanese and English!
 Am I awesome? Am I awesome?!"
"You\'re so smart, Ange‐chan!
 You deserve a pat on the head...!"
"Nnnn.
 I like it when you do that."
"Just change a single letter, and even mackerel can make a fine desert.
 Are you starting to see how omnipotent mackerel is?"
"The day I\'m forced to serve a joke like that for dessert, I imagine heads will roll......"
"I wouldn\'t like it either.
 I like ice cream for dessert."
"Ahahahahahaha, of course.
 By the way, we shouldn\'t be worried, should we?
 What about tonight\'s dessert?"
"Ohohohohoho......
 I can hardly wait to surprise everyone with the mackerel fruit parfait waiting there in the kitchen!"
"Nooooooo!!"
Everyone burst out laughing.
For some time after that, I was tormented by the terrifying image of a parfait neatly topped with mackerel bits...
"What a shame......
 I tried so hard to stop you from getting that prize, but you solved my best riddle like it was nothing."
Though she said that, Kumasawa smiled.
A gold‐colored medal glittered in her wrinkly hand.
Ange took it.
"Well then, that\'s all for our puzzles."
"Please keep up the pace, get more and more medals, and win that splendid prize from the Master!"
"Okay! Thank you.
 I\'m going to think even harder next time...!
 We did it, Auntie Eva!"
"Eheheh!
 Let\'s keep it up!"
We rushed away.
Okay, who should we take on next...?!
"It seems that all of a sudden, the tiny girl who used to hide and tremble in Kyrie‐sama\'s shadow...
has grown to be so bright and cheery..."
"......With each passing family conference, one can feel the growth of those youngsters.
 After just a few years more, Ange‐sama will surely learn of love, of makeup,
 and will eventually grow to become a true lady."
"Very true......
 If she grows normally with the passing time, that is..."
A cruel fate...
...forces the chick called Ange into a lonely future.
If an egg isn\'t warmed, it won\'t hatch.
The egg she is now will not be warmed by anyone, and neither will it hatch...
"Inside that frozen egg,
 will Ange‐sama have no choice but to face that isolated future...?"
"......An egg\'s shell can always be broken from the inside.
 ......Even if a cold shell is very, very hard, that doesn\'t mean it cannot be broken."
"Does Ange‐sama have the strength to do that?"
"Is she capable of achieving that or not...?
 I hear that question is what this final game is all about."
"Perhaps we should have sent her a clearer message.
 ......If the egg cannot be warmed, could we not at least strike it from the outside to make it easier to crack?"
"If a chick too powerless to even break its own shell is forced outside of the egg,
 it won\'t be able to withstand the cold winds.
 Ange‐sama will have to find that power and resilience herself."
"......I understand that she needs power and resilience,
 but can we not somehow explain it to her?"
"Words cannot be given. They can only be accepted.
 ......No matter what we try to give Ange‐sama, it will be meaningless unless she accepts it."
"............You are right.
 No matter what we try to tell Ange‐sama, it won\'t matter unless she listens."
"Hohohoho......
 We can do nothing but watch over her.
 You can lead a horse to water, but you can\'t make it drink."
"Ange‐sama must choose a better future for herself.
 ......We can only pray that she does."
"If Ange‐sama does not abandon herself to anger for the sole purpose of distracting herself from her resignation and sadness,
 ......if she can just be honest about that one, single wish that she truly desires more than anything else,
 then you can be certain that she will make her greatest wish come true."
"It is ironic.
 ......Since the very beginning, she has been denying that greatest wish of hers herself."
"Laughter brings happiness.
 Tears bring misfortune.
 Those who believe will be saved.
 ......People have the power to create their own futures by the strength of their emotions."
"I wish we could just let her hear those words......"
"Battler‐sama is very strict.
 ......He\'s hoping that Ange‐sama will realize it by her own power alone...and is not permitting even words of this nature to be told to her."
".........It seems we can do nothing but watch over her."
"And so, let us pray, at least.
 Pray that she grasps the world she desires most with her own hands."
"Oh, have you selected me?"
"Yeah.
 I\'ll have to face everyone sooner or later.
 Right, Auntie Eva?!"
"Right!
 Come on, let\'s have a puzzle.
 We\'ll solve it in a flash!"
"Hahahaha.
 I see, I see.
 Then it seems I must make it a good one."
"Genji.
 You should give her one as well.
 A tough one."
"As you wish.
 ......In that case, a tough one it shall be..."
Whoa.
I\'d been thinking that Genji‐san would give me a simple puzzle, but now he\'s saying it\'ll be tough.
 Scary.
But I\'ll have to beat him at some point.
 I can\'t let myself get scared.
"Then let us start with mine.
 I am a doctor,
 so how about an ambulance puzzle?"
"The ??? is a number?
 But "emergency" is a word.
 You can\'t add a number to a word, right?"
"That part sounds like some kind of pun.
 "Kyuu" means "nine", so "Kyuu, kyuu" makes you think "nine, nine", right?"
"So, if you add "???" to 99, you get an ambulance?"
"Hmm. Why does some number added to 99 get you an ambulance?
 ............Ah, I\'ve got it!"
"Huh, really?!
 Hey, what is it?!"
"I\'ll give you a hint.
 The "different kind of vehicle with a red flashing light" is a police car.
 *giggle*, you\'re starting to get it now, aren\'t you?"
"Huh? ......Nnnnn......
......I don\'t get it..."
"Oh, are you having trouble?
 I thought it was an easy puzzle."
It\'s a bit annoying to hear that about a puzzle I don\'t get.
Still, no matter how annoyed I get, I still don\'t have a clue what the answer is.
"Aw, so close.
 I thought you\'d made it pretty far too..."
Apparently, Auntie Eva knows the answer.
 She looked disappointed that I hadn\'t figured it out too.
".........Mmmmmhh...
 Ah, yes, I have it!
 If you subtract two from an ambulance, then add on 60, you can even learn the weather."
"Well done, Kinzo‐san.
 It seems I must hand this medal over to you."
"Wahahahahahaha.
 Sorry, Ange.
 This medal\'s all mine."
".........F‐fine, see if I care."
The gold medal passed from Nanjo to Kinzo.
That medal was supposed to be mine......
 It\'s no use regretting it now.
If you subtract two from and add 60 to an ambulance...?
 How would that tell you the weather...??
"Hmm, what was the number for the weather forecasting service again?"
"............???"
Yeah, I don\'t have a clue.
I\'ll just have to pick myself up and have a go at Genji\'s puzzle.
"20!
 "Kyuu‐kyuu" sounds like "99", and if you add 20 to 99, you get 119.
 That\'s the emergency number for ambulances!"
"And if you subtract 20 from 130, you get 110.
 That\'s the emergency number for calling the police."(Add 20 to 99 and write it in reverse to get 911, the US number for both.)
"Splendid! That is correct.
 I knew you were a quick thinker, Ange‐san."
"Oooooooh, well done, Angeeeeeeee!
 What a clever granddaughter I have!"
"Congratulations.
 This medal belongs to you."
At any rate, the gold medal glittering in Nanjo\'s hand is now mine.
Okay, now I\'ll defeat Genji too and get another one.
"Yes, that\'s the spirit.
 Let\'s keep on solving them!"
"Your turn, Genji‐san."
"My friend here doesn\'t speak much, but his knowledge is quite extensive.
 Even I cannot wait to see what sort of puzzle he whips up."
"Now then, Ange‐sama.
 Prepare yourself.
 The puzzle starts now."
......I\'ve never heard anyone say "prepare yourself" like that when giving a quiz.
I started to get so tense that my stomach began to hurt...
"It\'ll be okay.
 Hang in there!"
Auntie Eva gripped my hand firmly, and my stomachache got a little better.
"......Ange‐sama, have you learned division?"
"Y‐yeah.
 I learned it in cram school."
"Incredible, a six‐year‐old who knows division?"
"Then there should be no problems.
 Here it comes."
This is bad...
 I did learn division, but I\'m not very good at it......
"Half of its remaining length burns away each hour, right...?
 After the first hour, it\'s burned down to half of 5 cm.
 During the next hour, it burns down to half of that.
 And during the third hour, it burns down to half of that again......"
"......I can\'t really do it without a calculator.
 Do you know the answer, Auntie Eva?"
"Ah, ......I\'ve got it.
 *giggle*, this is a pretty mean puzzle."
"Why is it mean?"
"This has nothing to do with division.
 Read through the puzzle again carefully."
......Umm,
 ......what was it, again......?
"My sincere apologies, but that is incorrect."
"Huh?!
 Why?!
 I know I did the math right...!"
"You see, ...there\'s no need for math in this puzzle.
 Yep, he tricked us good this time..."
"Wahhahahahahahaha.
 Too bad, Ange.
 Did you get it, Nanjo?"
"Yes, of course.
 Division is unnecessary.
 This was an easy puzzle, one that even Ange‐san could have solved."
Not only Auntie Eva, but everyone else said that math wasn\'t needed.
And I worked so hard on that division......
"That is all for my puzzle.
 I believe several others are waiting for you to challenge them, Ange‐sama.
 Perhaps you ought to search for the next challenge."
"Good luck, Ange‐san.
 I am rooting for you."
"That\'s right.
 This is no time to get down!
 Now\'s our chance to turn things around."
"Yeah!
 I\'ll try even harder and get lots of medals!"
We dashed away.
There are still many people waiting to give me puzzles.
 I have tons of chances to get medals.
Okay, who should I challenge next...?!
"......After one hour, 5 cm becomes 2.5 cm,
 ...and in the next hour, that becomes 1.25 cm,
 ...and in the next hour, that becomes 0.625 cm......"
"..........................."
"Ange‐chan.
 You don\'t need to use math.
 Make sure you remember the problem clearly...
 How long......is the candle when the flame goes out...?"
"Ah!
 That was a close one...!
 The candle goes out when it\'s 1 cm long, so the rest doesn\'t matter!"
The flame on this candle dies when the candle is 1 cm in length.
In other words, it can never get shorter than 1 cm.
So the right answer is the fifth choice, "About 10 mm"...!
"That\'s right...!"
"You are correct."
"Oooh, splendidly done, Ange!
 How clever of you, not to be misled!"
"I didn\'t even need division.
 I almost got tricked...!"
"You were pretty mean there, Genji‐san.
 You even asked her if she could do division.
 That was a trap, right?"
"Correct.
 My humble apologies."
"Hahhahahahaha.
 After all, Genji‐san is the sort who can trick you without changing his expression in the slightest."
"Congratulations, Ange‐sama.
 This medal is proof that you have correctly solved my puzzle."
"Thanks!
 Eheheh, I got another medal, Auntie Eva...!"
"Heheh, nice going!"
"I\'ll get lots more.
 I\'ll get a ton, and then Grandfather will give me a great prize!"
"Mm.
 Give it all you\'ve got, my granddaughter...!"
"Good luck, Ange‐san.
 I am rooting for you."
"There must be others waiting for you.
 Perhaps you ought to search for the next challenge."
"Okay! Thank you.
 I\'ll try even harder now...!"
We dashed away.
There are still many people waiting to give me puzzles.
 I have tons of chances to get medals.
Okay, who should I challenge next...?!
After Ange and Eva left,
 ......Battler, who had been watching their progress, came over.
"How is Ange doing?"
"Oh, Battler.
 I am not certain of her progress, but she does seem to be enjoying herself."
"I heard your puzzle, Genji‐san.
 Even I was almost taken in back there."
"You honor me."
"Still, it\'s not quite what I\'d have expected.
 Who\'d have thought that you\'d give a trick question like that?
 I figured you\'d make a straightforward, simple puzzle."
"Hahahahahahaha.
 You might expect such a thing from him, silent as he is,
 ......but he is much more of a schemer than he appears."
"Very true.
 If you play a chess match against him, you\'ll see that right away."
"He even fools me, from time to time.
 He\'ll trick me right to my face, with that stern, serious expression of his.
 He has always been like that.
 And yet, despite the numerous occasions on which he has fooled me in the past, I keep on getting tricked.
 Wahhahhahahahahahaha."
"Come to think of it,
 .........what sort of relationship do you and Genji‐san have?"
For just an instant, Kinzo glanced at Genji\'s face.
Apparently, he didn\'t plan on touching on this subject if Genji had any objections.
However, Genji began to answer the question himself, as though the matter was no longer deserving of secrecy.
"......I knew the Master once...in Taiwan."
"Wahaha, "knew me", he says...!
 We were partners in crime, you might say!
 The two of us were both prodigal sons of rich families.
 A pair of ruffians who caused their parents nothing but trouble."
"Genji‐san, a prodigal son...?
 That\'s a surprise......
 So, Genji‐san, you also moved to Taiwan and met Grandfather there?"
"...............No.
 I am a native of Taiwan."
"Genji‐san was born in Taiwan.
 .........Well, since Taiwan was under Japanese rule before the war, he is still Japanese, of course."
"He was a man who hated losing.
 When we first met, we fought all the time.
 Once we hit it off, we became the best of friends."
"......There was a lot of disorder and conflict after the war.
 The Master is the one who saved me during that chaotic period.
 ......If I spent the rest of my life trying to repay that debt, it would not be enough to pay it back in full."
".........Don\'t say that, my friend.
 ......If only I had been a little more persuasive, I might have saved your family as well...
 I was too feckless to save anyone but you..."
I don\'t know much about the details of Taiwan\'s history,
 but apparently, there was still a lot of chaos there even after the war ended and Japan pulled out.
Kinzo, predicting this chaos before it happened,
 worked out a way for Genji and his family to escape.
However, Genji\'s family possessed great wealth in Taiwan.
 They were unable to abandon it, and they decided to remain there.
This wealth had been built up thanks to their close relationship with the Japanese‐run government of Taiwan.
The new regime after the war wasn\'t likely to welcome them with open arms.
Much mayhem and confusion followed.
 And Genji was the only one who escaped harm.
......I don\'t know what happened to make this man, referred to by Kinzo as a troublesome prodigal son,
 change so drastically to become the person he is today.
That is a story of friendship between the two of them,
 ......and there could be hardly any point in an unrelated person sifting through history books to argue for their personal interpretation.
They had been good friends since long ago, and they owed each other their lives.
 Though the troubled times had tossed them about, their friendship held firm for decades...
Genji\'s role was now that of the butler,
 ......but when the two of them were alone in the study, they sometimes shared a drink and reminisced about the days of their youth.
......And they\'re still that way today.
Leaving Kinzo and Genji to reminisce, Battler walked off on his own.
It would be rude to ask for any more detail, and there was no need to know.
Kinzo and Genji had been friends since long, long ago.
That information was nothing new.
"What do you think?
 Do you want to challenge Auntie Natsuhi and Uncle Krauss next?"
"Yeah.
 Let\'s beat them!"
"Hahahaha. Very well, we\'ll play along."
"The two of us have prepared some formidable puzzles for you."
"Should I go first?
 Or you?"
"I will start."
"Very well."
"Listen closely to what I\'m about to say.
 White black white black white ? black white black white black white."
"Huh?
 White black white black......huh??"
"I\'ll say it once more.
 White black white black white ? black white black white black white.
 ......What does the question mark stand for?"
This is......a really hard one.
White black white black white ? black white black white black white.
It looks like the white and black are alternating, but the question mark is between a white and a black.
Is it......gray??
 Is it that easy...?
"Th‐...this is a surprisingly hard one, coming from you, Natsuhi nee‐san......"
Auntie Eva was groaning.
 Apparently, this one\'s really hard.
"I‐is it really so hard...?"
"......There\'s a chance that some people won\'t understand, if they haven\'t had the right experiences."
"Eva‐san aside, I think Ange‐chan would have seen it a lot at school and kindergarten......"
"Wh‐what? Are you saying I\'ll never get this one?"
Is it a problem that I could get easier than Auntie Eva......?
......It\'s hard.
"The hint for this one is probably what Natsuhi nee‐san said, about something you might see in a school or kindergarten.
 ......Do you know what it is, Ange‐chan?"
"No, I\'m stuck."
"See, even Ange‐chan says she\'s stuck!
 Give her at least a little hint."
"I, I see.
 Then, a hint......
 White black white black... They may be different colors, but you get a beautiful sound no matter which you push."
"A beautiful sound......?
 Are these black and white things something that make sounds?"
"Black and white things that make a sound when you push them......?"
"............I don\'t get it."
"I give up too.
 ......It seems even you know some pretty hard puzzles, Natsuhi nee‐san."
"Hahahaha.
 It\'s the sort of puzzle that brings out one\'s upbringing.
 Perhaps it was a bit too hard for you."
"Wh‐what did you saaaaaaay...?!"
"......Auntie Natsuhi.
 Could you tell me the answer?"
"The answer is...a keyboard."
"A keyboard?
 Like on a piano?"
"That\'s right.
 The blacks and whites are the pattern of colors on a keyboard.
 In which case, you must already know the right answer."
Auntie Natsuhi smiled at me, but I don\'t really remember what a keyboard looks like.
......Aw, too bad.
I\'d better have a go at Uncle Krauss\'s puzzle and redeem myself.
"Ready?
 It\'s Nii‐san\'s turn now.
 We\'ll solve it in a flash and teach him a lesson, okay?"
"That black and white thing, ......it\'s a keyboard!
 Like a piano!"
"Ah, ......is that it?!
 It\'s a keyboard?!"
Something that can be found in kindergartens and schools, which is covered with a line of white and black things.
It\'s an instrument.
Like a keyboard on a piano or a melodica.
"The first two black keys are between "do", "re", and "mi".
 The set of three black keys are between "fa", "so", "la", and "ti"......"
"It started "white black white black white ? black", so......the three white ones are "do", "re", and "mi"......"
"There is no black key between "mi" and "fa".
 So, "fa" comes right after "mi"!"
"And since the question mark comes after "mi", the right answer is "fa".
 ......In other words—"
""The right answer is white!""
"Correct.
 I thought it might have been a bit too hard, but you did well."
"Splendidly done, you two.
 Go ahead, Natsuhi."
"Congratulations, Ange‐chan.
 Here\'s my medal for you."
"Alright!
 Auntie Eva, I got another one!"
"Things are moving along nicely.
 Next up is Nii‐san\'s puzzle.
 Let\'s solve it in a flash and teach him a lesson, okay?"
"How interesting.
 Looks like it\'s time you were taught a lesson."
"Stop it, Auntie Eva! Don\'t provoke him!
 You\'ll make the puzzle harder!"
"Heheheheheheh.
 If there\'s anyone you have to blame, it\'s Eva!
 Now take this brain‐twister!
 Here\'s a puzzle about the tenants of a skyscraper I\'ve invested in."
"I don\'t know anything about this skyscraper,
 so there\'s no way I could know......"
I know what\'s on floors 1, 2, and 14, so the answer must be one of the other floors.
 There\'s no doubt about that.
"Heheheheh.
 Do you give up?"
"I, I won\'t give up, kiii!!
 So Murakoshi Publishing Co., Ltd. is definitely on some floor?!"
"Some floor, yes.
 But not the somethingth floor."
"What\'s the difference...?"
"......Ah.
 ................................."
Auntie Eva suddenly stumbled on something.
Then, she started counting on her fingers, starting from the first floor......
"I\'ve got it, Ange‐chan...!
 Try saying them aloud, starting from "the first floor"...!
 There\'s only one that fits the question!"
"Huh?
 Wh‐what do you mean......?"
".........I don\'t get it."
"It isn\'t on "the somethingth floor", but it is on "some floor". That\'s the trick."
"That\'s right.
 Though, in a way, the answer is right there in the question."
"What do you mean...?"
"For example, let\'s take the fourteenth floor.
 "The "fourteenth floor" is the "somethingth floor", right?
 But "the first floor" isn\'t the "somethingth floor"... you wouldn\'t call it "the firTH floor"."
"Precisely.
 And with the first and second floors ruled out, there\'s only one other that doesn\'t end in "th"."
"A‐......ah........."
By this point, even I had figured out the answer.
If only I\'d paid a bit more attention to the way Uncle Krauss said the question......
"Hahahahahahaha.
 Too bad.
 Looks like I\'ll be keeping this medal."
"The third floor!"
"Mgh..."
"Well done, you got it...!
 Ignoring the first two floors, the only floor that doesn\'t end in "th" is the third."
"Yeah!
 "The third floor" fits, but all the other ones after that are the "somethingth" floor."
"N‐......nicely done...
 And even I didn\'t figure it out until I had the answer given to me......"
Apparently, Uncle Krauss once had this puzzle shown to him, and he wasn\'t able to answer it right.
He looks a bit bitter that a kid like me was able to solve it.
......I think what\'s really frustrating him is Auntie Eva solving it, not me.
 Weird.
"Come on, now.
 Let\'s see that medal."
"This medal is a mark of Ange‐chan\'s intelligence.
 It\'s not for you, Eva."
"Heh, sore loser...!"
"Thank you, Uncle Krauss.
 Am I awesome? Am I awesome?!"
"Very much so.
 You\'re a more flexible thinker than your uncle.
 I am proud to have you as a niece."
"That\'s all for our puzzles."
"I do hope you enjoyed them."
"I did!
 Thank you, Auntie Natsuhi and Uncle Krauss!"
"I hope you can enjoy all the tricky and interesting questions without worrying about your medal count too much."
"We all hope that this becomes a wonderful night, just for you."
"We really are enjoying ourselves."
"Yeah!
 We\'re having a lot of fun!"
Krauss and Natsuhi smiled at them as they dashed away.
"Oh, it\'s you, Natsuhi.
 How did your puzzles go?"
"We selected our questions as carefully as we could,
 ......but I\'m not sure how much they enjoyed them."
On the other side of the room, Ange and Eva were counting the medals they had gathered so far.
Ange and Eva.
 ......Such an unexpected pairing, but they looked like they were having a great time.
"......A future parent and child, unrelated by blood.
 Watching them like this, they look just like a normal parent and child."
"Yes, they do.
 .........Bonds between people are nurtured by the heart.
 Ties of blood do not bond as strongly."
After saying this,
 ......Natsuhi bit back her own words and stared at the floor.
"What\'s wrong?"
".........I was just...surprised that I would dare to say such words......"
"........................
 ......You don\'t need to worry about me."
"Because I rejected you, ......you met a painful fate in so many worlds...
 ......All of that is my responsibility..."
"I understand how you felt.
 ......Unable to become pregnant, you were forced to feel shame for many years.
 In that situation, any woman would be shocked if they were handed a baby whose parentage they didn\'t even know, ...and then told to adopt them."
"......That was no reason...
...for me to push you off a cliff..."
"True.
 You will have to carry that cross for the rest of your life."
"......Yes.
 I am prepared to do so..."
"In that case, the suffering you must endure will come from the cross you bear.
 Not from me."
"You don\'t......despise me...?"
"Look, don\'t make that dejected face.
 ......In fact, no, ......I think I\'ll say the opposite.
 As long as you do continue making that dejected face, I will feel no desire to punish you.
 As long as you continue to carry that cross,
 I will feel no desire to hate you."
"Despite what I did to you, ......you still don\'t hate me......?"
"Oh, I did hate you.
 I hated your guts.
 I hated you so much, I wanted to hang up a pillow with your picture on it and use it as a punching bag!"
"But, as I watched you, that feeling faded away.
 ......You regretted and lamented.
 And I\'m sure you\'ll never forget that feeling for as long as you live."
"How could I forget......?
 ......After all, I\'m a murderer........."
"You burdened yourself with one hell of a heavy cross, didn\'t you?
 I feel compassion for you now.
 I\'m serious.
 I mean, all of this is really Kinzo\'s fault."
"It\'s his fault for having an illegitimate child in the first place!
 And the way he forced that child on you was even worse!
 Instead of "you can\'t give birth, so adopt this kid",
 he should at least have been able to avoid hurting you by saying something like "please take care of this poor child".
 Men! That Kinzo...!"
".............................."
"I no longer hate you.
 Does the cross you bear not feel any lighter for that?"
"It doesn\'t.
 ......I still don\'t know how I can make up for what I did to you."
"Then let\'s do it this way.
 Hold out your arms."
"H‐......huh?
 L‐...like this...?"
As Natsuhi spread her arms uncertainly,
 Beato leapt forward and hugged her tight.
"......U‐umm,
 ......th‐this is a little........."
"I\'ll never say this again, so let me say it once.
 ......After all, I never had a chance to meet my mother."
Still hugging Natsuhi, Beato spoke in a whisper.
She spoke those words that she would certainly never say again...
"Thank you for worrying so much for my sake.
 ......But I really don\'t hate you anymore.
 Please, believe that,
 ............Mother."
"......{f:5:B}‐.........{f:5:Beatrice}..............."
