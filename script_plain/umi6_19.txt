""Then let the pair exchange their rings!!""
......Beato took Battler\'s hand.........and put a ring with the seal of the One‐winged Eagle on his finger.
".........Are you sure...?"
"You are already the territory lord.
 ......So, this ring belongs to you, Battler‐san."
"......You\'re certain?
 ......This is the world you created...... Your tale."
"Yes.
 .........I created this tale because I wanted to be with you.
 ......That means the purpose of this world has been fulfilled.
 ......So, from now on, ......I want you to write it.
 ......The rest of the tale...about you and me."
"................................."
"......Heh, or am I dragging you out of your comfort zone?!
 *cackle*cackle*, I am merely pushing the tiresome task of territory lord onto you.
 It\'s much easier being the wife, where you only have to brag...!"
"I just need to play around and wait for you to write a new tale.
 And, for each new tale you write, I will play any role you devise for me.
 .........A wicked witch, or an adversary.
 ......A lover, ......or a wife."
"My tales are pretty intense.
 You\'ll be busy from dawn until dusk."
"Hmm...... Sounds perfect..."
Beato\'s hand relinquished the ring of the territory lord......
From Battler, she received a silver ring with a crest that could only be worn by the wife of the territory lord.
Then, they exchanged their rings, ......and their wedding was complete.
Then, the pair turned around, ......faced the packed crowd of guests, and raised their rings high.
A thunderous applause rang out for them......
"In commemoration of the night\'s events, the great territory lord will now recognize the accomplishments of certain people."
"Let those called come forward."
At Battler\'s nod, Beato read the name of the first guest to be recognized.
"......Kanon.
 Come forward."
"K‐Kanon‐kun...?!"
A girl goat pushed her way through the crowd, took off her mask, and yelled.
A cloud of gold butterflies gathered before Battler and Beato...
...and took the form of Kanon, kneeling in front of these two nobles.
Kanon had already died and vanished.
......However, all of the dead revive in the Golden Land.
"Kanon, right here......"
"When my husband was locked up and in danger,
 you rescued him and displayed your self‐sacrifice by choosing to remain in the eternal prison in his place.
 Your devotion is deserving of commendation.
 Therefore, we will allow for your resurrection, as well as your continued service."
"......My lady,
 I am deeply thankful!"
"Kanon‐kun, ......Y‐...Yoshiya‐kun!!
 Yoshiya‐kunnnn!! Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!!"
Jessica raced forward and landed sobbing in Kanon\'s chest.
Kanon patted her head gently and held her......
"You won\'t be serving as furniture.
 You\'ll be serving as a human.
 ......Do you understand what that means?"
"............I do!"
After looking at Jessica sobbing, ......he looked at Battler again and nodded forcefully.
"Now for the next pair.
 Ushiromiya George and Shannon!
 Come forward!!"
""Yes.""
George and Shannon were the next to be called.
Perhaps they had already readied themselves.
 They walked forward boldly and kneeled.
"Ushiromiya George, right here."
"Shannon, right here......"
"You two withstood Zepar and Furfur\'s trials until the very end.
 Your great achievements and affection, determination and nobility are exemplary and deserving of commendation.
 Therefore, I issue you a marriage certificate signed by his lordship!"
""We are deeply thankful.""
"This certificate overrides objections from one and all!
 Let the families of those recognized bless this union with all their hearts!!"
"You heard her.
 No more squabbling, let\'s all just throw rice at them and celebrate.
 Congrats, you two!"
When the territory lord clapped his hands in celebration, it spread throughout the entire cathedral.
Then, a group of goats in the front line of the crowd took their masks off one by one...
"......N‐now listen here!
 I won\'t stand for you making too much salty miso soup, understand?!
 And George is getting a little overweight, so go easy on the sugar—"
"George! When a man gets married,
 he\'s got to treasure his wife even more than his parents!
 No matter what your mother says, you make sure you protect Shannon‐chan!"
"Yes, of course!!"
"George‐san...!!"
"G‐George needs a solid seven hours of sleep each night!
 I\'ll never forgive you if you let him stay up late!!
 And don\'t forget that washing his back and cleaning his ears are also a wife\'s responsibilities!!"
"I‐is that true...? Wh‐what have I done..."
"...Th‐that varies depending on the family......"
"Rudolf‐san, have you been properly caring for your wife?"
"Y‐you should know...
 Why are you suspicious...?!"
"Find happiness, you two.
 Marriage isn\'t the goal.
 It\'s just the starting line, okay?"
"Uu‐uu‐uu!
 Congratulations, congratulations!!"
"Uryuu!! Congratulaaaaaaatioons!!!"
"We can\'t let them beat us, can we?"
"Heh, heheheheheheh...!!
 Y‐yeah, no way we\'re losing, dammiiiiiiiiiiit!!"
All of the Ushiromiya family, all of the servants, and all of the spirits and demons in attendance...
...celebrated the honorees with even greater applause...
Thus, .........the tale woven by the Golden Witch comes to an end.
It seems proper to conclude the tale with the epitaph.
The following is the passage on the Golden Land from the Golden Witch\'s epitaph.
The witch shall praise the wise, and bestow four treasures.
One shall be all of the Golden Land\'s gold.
One resurrects all the dead people\'s souls.
One even revives all the love they possessed.
And one for the witch to eternally rest.
Rest in peace, my beloved witch, BEATRICE......}
"........................
 ......So, this means Beato now rests fulfilled...?"
"That interpretation is probably appropriate..."
"And?
 Now that the game is over, Onii‐chan will be released, right?
 ......What will happen to him?"
"......Well, I wonder.
 .........The book of this fragment tells no more of the story."
"............So, in the end, we don\'t even find out what happens to Onii‐chan.
 .................."
......It\'s not as though anything will come out of it anyway.
In the end, Onii‐chan and the others never came back.
They reached the Golden Land and enjoyed themselves there.
......So says the tale, ......but in reality,
 .........everyone died......in that horrific accident......
"Still, .........I\'ve learned a lot of very interesting things.
 ......That island really is.........a crazy place of illusions."
"Indeed.
 ......And your reading was truly wonderful..."
"......I feel worn out, like watching a six‐hour movie all at once.
 ......I\'m tired."
"Ushiromiya Ange.
 You really have worked hard.
 .........My boredom was eased by your reading.
 The gratitude I feel towards you is one I have not felt since long before I stopped counting the years..."
"If you\'re grateful, why can\'t I have some kind of "commendation" too?"
"Hmm, what would be good...
 ......Give me some time.
 I will think."
FEATHERINE sat down in her rocking chair and rocked it gently, apparently trying to think of something...
"......Ushiromiya Ange.
 You really have worked hard.
 ......You have done well to keep reading for me until the end.
 ......With this, your responsibilities as my miko are lifted.
 You may return to your original world and be reunited with the fate that you have been given."
"Sheesh.
 ......Feels like this was one hell of a side‐trip."
"Do not pout.
 I am thinking of a reward now......
 ......Yes, why not, every once in a while...
 .........That said, it has been quite some time.
 ......I imagine the ink from the bottle has dried up by now......"
Even after the tale ended, Ange and Hachijo\'s debate over it continued for quite some time.
It was very serious......and fiery.
Ange had acknowledged that this tale was no crazy literary work,
 ......but a new message bottle, which had drifted here once more from the Rokkenjima of twelve years previous to tell her of a single possible truth...
And.........it seemed as though she had found her own interpretation...
of the truth she thought the tale was trying to tell.
......Of course, that was only one truth,
 and it did not mean an end to her journey.
Still, ......this interpretation had its place.
It wasn\'t sufficient to fill the twelve‐year gap in her heart.
......However, for now, ......she was content just to enjoy the feeling the tale had created...
along with the bitter coffee Hachijo had made.
"......Thank you for reading until the end.
 ......And thank you for your thoughts and opinions.
 ......I\'m sure the very first Endless Witch is happy..."
".........Wow, so you can say stuff like that.
 ......If you\'d just talk like that from the beginning, I\'ll bet you\'d have tons more fans."
"......I am merely praising the wonderful reader that you most certainly are.
 ......I just wanted to say that rather than write for a silent readership of unthinking swine,
 I would find it a much more productive use of my limited time on this earth to write a manuscript for you alone......
 *giggle*."
"That\'s the kind of thing you don\'t have to say.
 ......Well, I\'ll take it as a compliment.
 .........Okay."
I get the feeling......that I\'ve spent a really, really long time here.
It feels......as though I\'ve spent a major fraction of my life here.
......It should feel uncomfortable, sitting here on a sofa in someone else\'s house,
 ......but for some strange reason, it feels as familiar as my own home.
However, the clock shows that it\'s been only about two or three hours since I met her.
 ......My sense of time feels very strange...
"......Your friend seems to be taking his time......"
"It must be a long phone call.
 It\'s creepy for a guy to talk that long on the phone."
He said he was going to make a scheduled report to Okonogi‐san, didn\'t he?
Even though he was told that he could use the phone here, he declined, and went to look for a public phone somewhere.
......Something about how he didn\'t want to risk being bugged.
 It was too ridiculous a point to argue, so I just left him to it.
"Is the public phone far?"
"If you go out onto the street, there\'s a store on the corner a short way down."
"Then I\'ll be on my way.
 ......Here, consider this payment for the snacks or whatever."
"......If I let you keep that money,
 will you come again, read my next manuscript, and tell me your opinions...?"
"......You\'re willing to pay rolls of money to get an uncouth girl like me to read your manuscript?"
"On the contrary,
 you were a good reader and a good thinker.
 ......It is in search of a person like you that we weave these tales and set them loose into the world."
".........You praise me too much.
 I just take books a little too seriously."
"As thanks for the considerable time you have given to me,
 .........I will someday write your tale."
"Am I going to appear in another of your Forgeries?
 ......I hope you kill me in a slightly better way this time."
"......Do you...like miracles?"
"You mean story contrivances?
 ......I used to hate them, but recently I\'ve become a big fan.
 I\'ve been spoiled, though, so you\'ll have to one‐up jumping off a skyscraper and ending up unharmed, because I don\'t even count that as a miracle anymore."
".........Then, one day, perhaps, I will write you a tale that you will consider a miracle......"
"I\'m......really sorry for barging in all of a sudden and saying all kinds of mean things."
"......Not at all. It was a worthwhile conversation.
 ...Perhaps I will have my head editor arrange another meeting between the two of us......"
"If the opportunity presents itself.
 <See you again, have a nice day>."
"Yes, it may happen again sometime.
 ......I pray that you find your truth."
"Thank you."
"If you ever do reach your truth,
 .........please try making your truth a tale as well someday..."
".........You want me to become one of you witches?
 I\'m not sure about that.
 I\'m bad at writing.
 A good reader isn\'t necessarily a good writer, you know?"
"Ah, quite true.
 I myself can never read anything written by anyone else."
"......Sheesh.
 Then, I\'m off."
"After this, I will probably never see you again,
 ......but I pray I will be fortunate enough to meet another you somewhere...someday."
"...........................
 Can I ask one last question?"
"Go ahead..."
".........That FEATHERINE witch, who appeared within the tale.
 ......That\'s...you, right?"
"It may be presumptuous to say it, but that was my intention."
"...........................
 ......This might be a strange question, but......umm...
 ...............Are you FEATHERINE?
 Or is FEATHERINE you?"
"......Why,
 ......I haven\'t the foggiest idea what you mean..."
The mysterious woman remained mysterious to the end.
.........And so I made it through a day I had no memory of, and the following day, I took a boat to Niijima.
I\'ll probably never see her again.
However, that just means that "I" won\'t see her—the other "me"s might, somewhere down the road.
......Just as "I" was able to reach several truths, I pray that they too......can reach their destinations.
So long, FEATHERINE.
......If you ever write a better story, please call me again.
If I\'m free, I might drop by......
"No problem.
 It\'s the cushiest escort job I\'ve ever had.
 ......I\'d almost like to invite you along, sir."
"......I\'ll take a pass on that.
 You know how old I am.
 I\'m done running around all over the place..."
The person on the other end of the line was Okonogi.
......Okonogi was also one who tended to move from place to place, so it hadn\'t been easy to catch him even on the phone.
"Our trip\'s been pretty <cool>, so right now, there\'s no need to run around."
"Sumadera Kasumi\'s searching like a madwoman for her.
 ......According to my source, she\'s fixed herself a ride to Rokkenjima already.
 You\'ll bump into her there."
"So, just as planned."
"...............It\'ll likely be just five or six people at most.
 And they\'ll probably be armed with nothing more than handguns.
 They\'re no match for you.
 Feel free to run wild.
 But make sure you kill them.
 ......Have you received that favorite toy of yours?"
"Of course.
 I\'m surprised you managed to get this into the country."
Behind Amakusa was the rental car that they had borrowed under a false name,
 ......inside of which was now a black golf bag.
"The Sumadera head family has already given the okay, but make sure you get out of Japan as soon as you\'re done.
 Don\'t forget to buy your cup ramen by the box in Narita before your flight out."
"Heheheh, I\'ll take care this time.
 .........It\'s an easy job."
"There\'s also............the other matter...... You understand me, right?"
"Other matter...
 .........Well, now you\'ve lost me."
"......Playing dumb, huh?
 ......Well, whatever.
 At the end of the day, you\'re a man who\'s never betrayed my expectations.
 ......If you\'re clever about it, you won\'t even have to get your hands dirty.
 ......There should be plenty of ways to handle it."
".......................................
 ......Heheh, I\'m not sure what you\'re talking about."
"......I know Ange‐chan\'s an unfortunate kid.
 ......Still, all she had to do was play the part of a secluded, wealthy young lady.
 ......Since Eva‐san\'s death, we\'ve all been in agreement on uniting together going forward.
 ......This little portable shrine of ours is important, ......but she\'s also a liability.
 We\'re talking about world peace here, right?"
"............Well, let\'s see how it goes.
 I hope those Sumadera black‐suits know how to shoot a gun right."
".............................."
"Hmm?
 What is it, sir?"
"......Don\'t tell me that, after a few days on the run,
 you and Ange‐chan have already hooked up...?"
"Ha.
 .........Me and that bratty little girl? ...Please."
"Hey, it\'s not like I care.
 It\'d mean you\'ve finally managed to move on, enough that you can take passes at women, at least.
 ......Half the world is women, you know.
 You\'ll never last if just one or two give you the jitters."
"..............................
 ......Oh, speak of the devil.
 She\'s here.
 ............Guess that\'s all for today.
 I\'ll contact you after I reach our lodgings on Niijima.
 Later."
Ange walked down the street towards me.
Why\'d she have to do that when I told her to wait for me to come back?
......If only she wasn\'t like this, she might have lived a long life.
"......That was a pretty long call.
 I was so tired of waiting that I left."
"Heheh. Sorry about that.
 ......How was it for you, missy?
 Did you learn anything interesting...?"
"It was interesting.
 .........That\'s all I got out of it."
"Hyahha...!
 Sounds <cool>."
After Amakusa opened the passenger\'s side door, Ange got in the car.
Amakusa quickly went around to the driver\'s seat.
".........Then let\'s head to the harbor.
 According to the old man, the Sumadera family has set up a net."
"...............If we do get caught, then that\'s the measure of my luck.
 ......If we don\'t, ......then Rokkenjima is waiting for me.
 ......Let\'s leave it all to luck."
".........Luck, is it?"
"When you can\'t decide what to do,
 or when it doesn\'t matter either way,
 ......it\'s not so bad to entrust your fate to a coin toss."
"Heheh.
 Then I\'ll leave it to luck too.
 ............I\'m no stranger to that sort of thing myself."
"......My bodyguard has just said he\'ll leave everything to luck.
 This sucks."
"Since I had to leave for that phone call, I totally missed the clincher.
 What happened after I left? Let\'s hear it."
"No, I\'m not telling."
"That\'s a shame."
The car dashed through the hilly town...
It would not return to Hachijo\'s house for all eternity.
However, Ange didn\'t get sentimental about it.
For now, ......she just wanted to silently consider the new message bottle...
...that the current Endless Witch, Hachijo Tohya, had given her...
In the rear‐view mirror, the town where a witch lived faded off into the distance.
However, that scene wasn\'t reflected in Ange\'s eyes......
