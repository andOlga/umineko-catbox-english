".........This way?
 ......That means go this way, right............?
 They are......inviting me to go this way, after all........."
......!!!
My heart leapt.
 ...Because there, ............gaping wide, ......was the opened mouth of eerie darkness.
"Wh‐.........what is this...
 What is this......?!"
When I strained my eyes, peering into the darkness, I saw something that looked like a light switch.
 ......In addition, there was a switch with open and close written on it.
I resolutely pushed the switch for the lights,
 and rough lights almost like you\'d find in a coal mine or something flickered on sporadically,
 making a staircase that stretched underground come hazily into vision...
It was creepy how it now looked even more gloomy with the lights turned on.
Other than the light switch, there was also a switch with open and close written on it.
...I could probably open and close it with this, but if I was unlucky enough to find that the open part was broken,
 I might be closed up in this creepy underground area for all eternity...
So for the time being, I didn\'t touch the open/close switch,
 ......and as I readied my gun again, I slowly went down the stairs.
Because the ceiling was very high, it didn\'t feel cramped.
On the contrary, it felt as though a cool breeze was blowing upwards, and I even sensed a spiritual presence from the eeriness of it...
With my gun at the ready, and carefully staring forwards, ......I continued descending the stairs......
The walls, the stairs, the lights, ...all of them were very old‐fashioned.
...It may be beyond doubt that this had been made at the same time that the mansion had been constructed on this island.
There were cracks in the ceiling, and water clung to the walls, constantly dripping down.
That water fell into a gutter that had been set up alongside the stairs, then quickly and silently flowed into the underground darkness.
 It was as though it was telling me to go faster...
The staircase turned back on itself a number of times.
 It was hard to tell how far underground I\'d gone, but I thought it to be much deeper than one floor.
And eventually, ............a rough, metal door showed itself.
And there, characters had been written in a dark red paint.
...They had probably been written a long time ago.
— 
On the tenth twilight, the journey ends, and you shall reach the Home of the Gold.}
My heart, which was already about to explode, jumped about even more as soon as I read those deep‐red characters...
There\'s no mistake...
 This is the last stop.
.........Father\'s......Golden Land...!!
I calmed my throbbing heart, somehow regained my composure, and readied the gun again.
...But since, in the end, I couldn\'t open the door with my gun held in both hands...
......I lowered the gun, carefully erased my breath, and opened the door......
"..................I‐......isn\'t this......inside the......?!"
My first impression when I saw the room...
...was to question whether it might have been connected to one of the rooms in the mansion.
Yes, this place had exactly the same atmosphere about it as the forbidden VIP room on the second floor.
But this was underground, so there were no windows.
There was only the solemn light of a grand chandelier.
But the quality of the interior, dimly lit by the faint light,
 was more than enough to take your breath away.
A bed with a canopy, and a rocking chair that looked like it would be very comfortable to sit in.
 An extravagant sofa and carpet.
The room was like a dream every girl yearns for at least once...
And yet, since it was an underground hidden room with no windows,
 it actually felt more like it could be the hidden house of a witch.
I had never swallowed the legend of BEATRICE, witch of the forest.
However, ......if you were shown this room,
 ......it certainly would become hard to doubt that she actually had existed,
 and had lived in here.
".........Is someone...
..................there...?"
Although I was dumbfounded by this room, I cautiously,
 ...no, timidly kept my gun raised, and searched the interior.
And......in the center of the room, I found it.
"...............Eee—..............."
My gasp came out strangely, as though a bunny was being choked.
...I mean, ......after finding something like this,
 ...no one would have any words other than that stupid voice...
"It\'s here......
 ......I‐......it\'s really here.........
 ......Father\'s......gold......!!"
On the opposite side of the canopy bed, it was piled up in a massive heap...
 A mountain, a mountain of gold ingots!!
Of course, they weren\'t piled up carelessly in a way that would damage the dignity of this room.
A beautiful scarlet satin weave was laid on the mountain of gold,
 creating a beautiful three‐colored mix between the red, the gold, and the black of the deep darkness...
It was as though, when the witch slept on this bed,
 the gold would be a respectful chamberlain waiting on her.
Nobly, refinedly, gracefully, beautifully.
It was piled there with an imposing and yet ceremonious air...
I tried to grab a single gold ingot and was surprised at its weight.
......It was probably about ten kilograms.
......Just this one ingot would easily be worth ten million without a doubt.
The Ushiromiya family crest, the One‐winged Eagle, was lightly imprinted on it.
It was hard to tell whether it had worn away, or whether the impression had been made carelessly in the first place,
 but it was certainly the crest of the One‐winged Eagle.
Just how many ingots are piled up here?
Just by roughly multiplying both sides, and multiplying that by the height, it must surely come to over several hundred.
My mind\'s already blank... I can\'t calculate it properly.
......Even a conservative count would put it easily above a billion yen.
"Well, of course... Of course it would be...
 ...I mean, it\'s ten tons of gold...
 At the current value, it\'s more than 20 billion yen of gold...
 I, ...I found it, ......before anyone else, .........I found it!!
 Ahaha, wahahahahahahaha, ahah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hahahahahahahahaha!!"
In front of the mountain of gold, I spread my arms and looked up at the ceiling.
A laugh without a trace of dignity flowed out from my entire body.
I had no intention at all of laughing in such a weird way,
 ...but I just, I just couldn\'t hold back the happy feeling that flowed throughout my entire body.
......That older brother of mine probably wouldn\'t accept his loss just because I had found this gold.
...But from now on, there would be no changing the fact that I had been the one to find the gold...!
To steal the headship of the family, I would still probably need some subtle tactics.
But after everything I\'ve gone through until now, that\'s a completely trivial problem.
Even if I lose out on the inheritance of the Ushiromiya family and everything...
...this 20 billion yen\'s worth of gold is now mine and mine alone!!
"Hahahaha, a‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐ha!!
 There was a time when I thought of money as such a worthless thing.
 I thought, there are so many things in this world that you can\'t buy with money."
"...But now I understand that that\'s just a lie!
 It was just an excuse that have‐nots make for themselves!!"
"With this mountain of gold before me, I\'ve finally realized something so obvious...!!
 I can give birth to all the happiness in this world by melting this gold!
 With this money, my husband\'s company is fine now.
 We will always be happy as a family.
 And I can even leave a vast amount of money to George...!!"
"The rest of the relatives will eventually be ruined and disappear.
 At that time, George will use this gold, and revive the Ushiromiya family\'s lost honor,
 just like Father did...!!
 There will be no room for anyone to argue then.
 ......George is the true successor of the Ushiromiya family!!"
It happened!!!
 My wish was granted!!
That dream I have wished for ever since I was born into this world as Ushiromiya Eva, has been granted completely in this very moment...!!
My husband and I will be happy for all eternity.
 And I can also give my only son, George, eternal happiness!!
There\'s no way I\'ll waste it on foolish pleasures!!
My older brother has chewed up the Ushiromiya family, but George and I will revive it!
And that means that we truly have succeeded the headship of the Ushiromiya family!!
"I succeeded...
 I did it, ...honey......George...
 ......I, ......your mother......finally succeeded...
 ......After this, we won\'t be threatened by anyone...
 Uuuhhu, uuuuUUuuuUUugghhuhuu!!"
That\'s right, after this, never again will we be smothered by sad nights.
Congratulations, me.
Congratulations, Ushiromiya Eva.
......Right here, right now, the sad half of our life has had its heart\'s desires granted.
"It\'s all thanks to you...
 I was blessed with this chance because of your magic.
 Because of that chance, I was able to make it here...!"
...Thank you.
 But my magic couldn\'t have been granted if we both didn\'t believe in each other.
So it isn\'t just the power of my magic.
This is our victory.
So, congratulations,
 "us".
"Thank you, me...
 Thank you, Ushiromiya Eva...
 ......I\'m so glad I didn\'t give in before now.
 I\'m so glad I didn\'t drown in sorrow and forget to keep struggling..."
".........No, this is my magic.
 Our magic!
 Your magic was the real thing.
 BEATRICE the witch of the forest is nothing more than an illusion.
 You are the real witch, who can use real magic.
 ......That\'s right.
 Right now, you are the Golden Witch, BEATRICE!!"
Eva decided to leave that place for the time being.
And when she climbed the stairs again, trying to leave this secret place...
......She saw a creepy, swaying human shadow blocking her path, and her dreamlike state was blown away.
".....................Who\'s there?!"
For an instant, ...she believed that the true master of this room, the real BEATRICE, had appeared.
It seemed that the other person was also holding a gun.
The two of them were pointing guns at each other.
And eventually, they each realized who the other was...
".........Rosa.........?"
"...Nee‐san...
 .........What are you doing in a place like this...?"
"I could ask you the same.
 What business do you have in a place such as this?"
"......I shouldn\'t have given you that hint, Nee‐san.
 If I hadn\'t, I definitely would have been the first to reach this place.
 .........Too bad."
It seemed that Rosa knew where this staircase went,
 and what was waiting ahead of her.
"That\'s rich.
 .........Coming from someone who arrived here after me."
".........I racked my brains too much over the sweetfish river.
 The sweetfish part didn\'t really matter that much at all, did it?"
"That isn\'t true.
 It was an excellent hint, if you ask me.
 Well, of course, maybe there was no need for it to be sweetfish.
 ...But when I heard that sweetfish are fish that go out into the sea, I was able to figure it out."
"......What is inside?"
"Why not see with your own eyes?
 It definitely won\'t betray your expectations."
"........................
 ......Don\'t be afraid, Nee‐san.
 I never had any interest in who became the head.
 I don\'t even care about the Ushiromiya family name.
 ......Honestly, Krauss nii‐san always did throw his weight around, saying that he was going to be the head,
 so I actually feel good about you stealing the position from him."
"............Are you serious?"
"Of course.
 I am the outsider of the Ushiromiya siblings.
 ......Even if Father had named me as the next head,
 there\'s no way my brothers would accept that.
 I try not to have such naive dreams."
"........................"
"Let me see too.
 The proof of your victory, Nee‐san.
 ......As long as I receive the proper portion that we agreed upon as siblings,
 I plan to actively accept you as the true victor in this "game"."
"............If you shot me, then you would have this gold all to yourself, right?"
"It\'s the same for you.
 If you shot me, this gold would all be yours."
"......................................."
For a tense while, the sisters pointed their guns at each other.
Eventually, after they sized up the glint in the other\'s eyes, they lowered their guns.
...Eva removed her finger from the trigger, and held the gun upside‐down.
It was a position that she couldn\'t quickly shoot from.
When she saw that, Rosa held hers the same way.
"......That\'s right.
 That plan of shooting the other and having all the gold to ourselves is fascinating for both of us."
"...But if one of us suddenly disappeared on this island while it\'s isolated by the typhoon, there would be a huge uproar.
 ......If we hid the corpse here, it probably wouldn\'t be found easily, but that isn\'t for certain."
".........No matter how many billion yen\'s worth of gold is on the line,
 it isn\'t worth the risk of committing murder.
 In the end, that would become a weakness for Krauss nii‐san and the others to squeeze all the money out of us with."
"I agree.
 ......Considering that Nii‐san or Rudolf could have been the one to show up here,
 ......it may have been a blessing in disguise that it was you.
 ...I trust you the most of all the siblings."
"............Thank you.
 I also trust you the most of the siblings, Nee‐san."
"...................................."
"............I want to see the gold too."
"Do you?
 Now I also want to see it again.
 Even though I saw it with my own eyes, it still doesn\'t feel real.
 ...Unless I see it together with you and check once more that it actually exists,
 it feels like the gold will turn to fog and disappear."
Eva started descending the staircase once more.
......However, she didn\'t carelessly expose her back to Rosa.
Likewise, even though at a glance it looked like Rosa had lowered her guard, she definitely didn\'t show any signs of carelessness.
......And they reached that room of the witch once again.
Rosa also gasped, made speechless by the vast amount of gold...
......Rosa and Eva walked absentmindedly through the rose garden.
They had left the guesthouse secretly, so they had to be careful when they returned as well.
They had to regain their sense of tension soon.
"......Congratulations, Nee‐san."
"Thank you."
"You decided it, didn\'t you?
 Fifty percent goes to the bearer of the title of successor to the head.
 ......It sure did work out well for you.
 That doesn\'t refer to Krauss nii‐san anymore.
 ...So your share is now fifty percent along with a quarter of the rest, for a total of 12.5 billion yen."
"Isn\'t that an incredible share?
 ...I\'m satisfied with 2.5 billion.
 Rudolf nii‐san won\'t complain either.
 Krauss nii‐san will probably be the only one to complain."
"......Yeah, you\'re right.
 ...After all, Nii‐san is the practical manager of Rokkenjima.
 And since the gold was on these premises,
 even though I was the first to discover it, things might get complicated if I don\'t handle it skillfully."
"It won\'t get complicated.
 We covered this and every other eventuality in excruciating detail in last night\'s discussion, didn\'t we?"
"............I wonder if it will really go that smoothly.
 I\'ve already completely gotten over my excitement.
 How we regulate everything from here on is the real problem."
"...That is a problem for the new head of the Ushiromiya family.
 You should enjoy that problem, Nee‐san.
 It has nothing to do with me."
"Hmm, sharp words..."
"......I\'ll support you as the second person to find it.
 So please at least give me the early payment we decided on.
 I\'d like 150 million yen by March."
"Yes, that\'s fine.
 ......If you support me, I can graciously pay you that much.
 I am not Nii‐san."
"Anyway, why don\'t we go and shock Nii‐san and the others?
 Even if we cover up the actual location, I want to see Krauss nii‐san\'s shocked face as soon as I can."
"...............
 ............Wait a second, Rosa.
 Wait a while before telling everyone about it."
"..................Huh?
 ...Why?"
"...You idiot, isn\'t it obvious?
 ...This is that haughty Krauss nii‐san and that sly Rudolf we\'re talking about.
 Even if we announce it eventually, it\'s still too early now."
"Unless we carefully investigate how we should move things along first,
 it\'s possible that all of the gold we\'ve finally found will be snatched away by Nii‐san."
Eva had thought she had just said something completely obvious.
...So when she saw Rosa\'s expression suddenly cloud over, she was a little surprised.
"......What are you unsatisfied about?
 You know well what kind of people those two are."
"...............
 Nee‐san, that\'s against the rules."
"What do you mean?"
"......Didn\'t we make a rule that whoever found the gold would announce it immediately?
 If you hesitate, the foundation of the rules will be destroyed,
 and that could lead to something worse in the future.
 ...With Krauss nii‐san as crafty as he is,
 that violation of the rules will complicate things later."
"Don\'t be stupid.
 This is Nii‐san\'s island.
 And that gold just now wasn\'t cash.
 We\'re talking about the liquidation of a vast ten‐ton mountain, you know?"
"It will take a significant amount of time to carry it off and turn it into cash.
 And that will only work in Nii‐san\'s favor, since he has practical control over this island.
 Don\'t you even realize that?!"
".....................I don\'t like searching each other for weaknesses like that.
 I just want to clearly lock in my 2.5 billion portion."
"Of course, if you were to give me 2.5 billion in cash right now,
 whatever you did next would be up to you.
 But until I have my share in my own pocket, I will follow the siblings\' rules."
"You\'re so naive...
 You don\'t understand Nii‐san\'s craftiness at all!"
......It wasn\'t that Rosa didn\'t understand the craftiness of her older siblings.
In that sense, Rosa more or less understood Eva\'s caution.
But in her heart,
 she couldn\'t clear away her even greater suspicion that Eva wanted to keep all of the gold to herself.
......Because she knew that Eva was at least as crafty as her other siblings, if not more.
In other words, by quickly informing the siblings of the gold\'s discovery,
 Rosa wanted to put a stop to any chance Eva had to keep the gold all to herself...
"..................
 ......Rosa.
 Sorry, but at least listen to me this once."
".........Are you saying that if I don\'t listen to what you say, you won\'t be able to prepare the 150 million?"
"........................
 ...That isn\'t the way I wanted to say it.
 ...But if you really need that money, it\'s more realistic to support me.
 ......If you talk to Nii‐san and Rudolf, even that natural portion of yours might disappear.
 You don\'t want that, do you?"
"........................"
For a while, a severe expression that she had never shown to her sister before rose to Rosa\'s face.
There wasn\'t even a trace of her restraint as a younger sister.
 ......There was just the ruthlessness,
 no, the seriousness of a single human arguing about a vast sum of wealth.
Eva made light of it, chuckling.
"......Dear me.
 A frightful murder has just taken place, and the culprit still may be on this island...
how careless we must be to stand around here talking like this."
"I\'m sure it\'s just the servants\' farce.
 No murder ever occurred on this island."
"......Oh?
 So you really do think that?"
"It can be clearly explained by the manner of the six deaths.
 The locked room involving those six definitely couldn\'t be created by a crime from the outside."
"......Doctor Nanjo said that they were all dead, but that was also a lie.
 This is all a complicated act that Father plotted.
 All of the servants are just pretending to be dead.
 ...A murder never occurred in the first place.
 There\'s no way that there\'s a murderer prowling around."
"...Huh...
 I\'m surprised that you would notice that.
 You looked fairly frightened, so I hadn\'t thought that you realized that much."
"......I\'m a person who can read between the lines in that kind of situation.
 Thanks to you, I\'ve been well trained."
That\'s right.
 Before we realized it, the servants had "died", and the members of the Ushiromiya family had become the only ones on this island.
And after Nanjo had proclaimed the "deaths" of the servants,
 and the relatives had begun to discuss the riddle of the epitaph, he had disappeared off upstairs as though he was in the way...
"Everything...
was an act to get us to challenge that epitaph.
 ......And that\'s exactly why...
you need to proclaim that you are the victor, Nee‐san."
"There\'s no way that burnt corpse is really Father.
 ......He prepared a corpse with the right number of toes from somewhere, and deliberately burned it in that horribly morbid way."
"......I\'m sure he\'s hiding somewhere, watching to see how we\'ll behave.
 ...I\'m sure he already knows that you have reached the Golden Land, Nee‐san."
"......And that\'s why you should proclaim soon that you are the winner.
 I\'m sure Father will appear out of nowhere and proclaim that you are his successor while clapping his hands."
"........................"
"...Well, still.
 ......I have to pester you for 150 million,
 so I can\'t work against you in anything."
".........So you\'ll listen to what I say, and be quiet about this to Nii‐san and the rest...?"
"...................................."
"......Make your position clear.
 ...Rosa."
"...............I want to tell them.
 We just made that rule last night.
 We shouldn\'t just throw that away."
"Of course, I will announce it in front of the siblings.
 ...However, I want to make very sure of the situation first.
 Carrying out ten tons of gold, converting it into money,
 and distributing it fairly."
"......Until I can affirm my ability to carry those out without Nii‐san getting in the way, I want some time to think.
 I only want to hold off my announcement until then.
 .........I\'m definitely not keeping it secret because I want it all for myself."
"..................
 ...You\'ll definitely announce it to everyone sooner or later, right?"
"...Yes, of course.
 Even I want to rub it in Nii‐san\'s face as soon as I can."
".........About how much time will you need to "think"?"
"I won\'t know that until I\'ve thought about it."
"............Would one night be enough?"
"I can\'t promise you that it will take only one night...!"
"Out of respect for you as the successor to the head, I will support you for one night.
 ......This year\'s family conference will end tomorrow morning, when the typhoon passes and a boat comes to get us.
 ...That\'s right, when the seagulls cry.
 ......I will remain silent until then."
"If you think that you need more time to think after that, ...let\'s talk about it again at that time, alright?
 .........I will support your position...
as much as possible."
"......You......really are cunning, aren\'t you?
 ...I\'m surprised.
 Were you always this strong‐willed?"
"......It\'s true that women become stronger when they have a child.
 I realized that in myself when I had Maria."
"...............
 Alright.
 I thank you for your cooperation for the time being.
 ...We can talk about tomorrow when it comes."
"Yes, that\'s right.
 ......I believe that you will be a fair‐minded successor to the head, who wouldn\'t even think of taking all of the gold for herself."
"...Isn\'t that obvious!
 ......I will split the gold evenly among the siblings as we agreed."
No way. I found this.
Because I, because we solved the riddle of the epitaph!
So this gold is all mine...!!
"I won\'t give it up to anyone!
 I am the head of the Ushiromiya family!
 I am, I am!!"
In a loud voice, the witch inside Eva claimed exclusive possession of everything.
...Of course, that didn\'t come close to reaching Rosa\'s ears, and it probably didn\'t even reach Eva\'s, either.
"......Mm.
 I shall acknowledge that.
 You are the true head of the Ushiromiya family, chosen by the witch\'s epitaph.
 Now, I shall acknowledge that upon my name."
"...Y‐
 .........you are.........
 That outfit...
you couldn\'t be...
......really...
BEATRICE......?"
Maybe BEATRICE was happy that Eva had called her by her own name.
 She cackled pleasantly.
In concert with that laugh, gold butterflies rose up as though a storm of gold dust had broken out in the room,
 and the room shone the color of gold...
"Indeed.
 I am the Golden Witch, BEATRICE."
"......*cackle*cackle*, there is nothing that should frighten you so.
 I am praising your exploits.
 ...Truly excellent.
 Imagine that you would spectacularly solve that riddle of the epitaph...
 It is worthy of my admiration...!"
"...You were the one who sent that letter?
 So I\'ll succeed all of the gold and the Ushiromiya family inheritance, right...?
 You wrote that in your letter.
 And I overcame that challenge...!"
"Mm.
 I shall acknowledge it.
 Now, all of this piled‐up gold, and everything of the Ushiromiya family, is for you to do with as you please.
 For as of this moment, you are already the Ushiromiya family head."
"R‐......really?
 It\'s true, right?
 Right?!"
"Do not become agitated.
 I am openly praising you.
 As proof, I shall grant you this."
BEATRICE took a ring off of her own finger,
 and held it out to Eva.
She fearfully accepted it,
 ......and realized that it was a ring.
"......C‐
......could.........
this be............"
"Mmhm.
 It is the proof of the Ushiromiya family headship, returned to me from Kinzo: the Golden Ring."
"From now on, it is yours.
 You may put it on your finger and display it high before your siblings.
 None should doubt that you have now succeeded the Ushiromiya family inheritance."
Eva stared closely at the ring.
...It certainly wasn\'t a fake.
 ...Without a doubt, it was the real thing.
She, who had dreamed of receiving this ring someday,
 and who had stared fixedly at it countless times, could say that for certain.
This ring...
had now designated her as its new owner,
 ......and had been handed over to her......
And...
timidly...
she put it on the middle finger of her left hand...
In that instant, ......she felt a deep emotion welling up inside her that she had never felt before.
Her mind grew blank.
 Both eyes opened wide.
That ring...was on her own finger.
Not in a dream, in reality............!
"That ring is surely also pleased.
 Because it was able to come to you, who had dreamed of putting it on your finger for so long."
"......The ring...
 ......Father\'s
......ring...............!"
"How many nights have you dreamed of putting that on your own finger as you have now done?
 ......The strength of those feelings became your magic and made that reality.
 Now, you are worthy of calling yourself a true witch."
"............Wh‐...who are you?
 ...Are you really......BEATRICE......"
"*cackle*cackle*.
 I am the Golden Witch BEATRICE!
 The Ushiromiya family alchemist!"
"Following my contract with Kinzo, I now pass everything on to you.
 ...All of the gold I entrusted Kinzo with.
 And all of the wealth he built up through that.
 And the honor and inheritance of the Ushiromiya family.
 And I will pass on my power, and the title of the Endless Witch."
"......A witch\'s...
...title......"
"I will pass on all of my magical power, and the titles of the Golden Witch and the Endless Witch.
 ......Following my Predecessor, I will hand over my name, BEATRICE, along with those titles.
 ......You may now call yourself by that name!"
Eva gulped.
 The chandelier light, which had seemed dim, now felt too bright.
"By my name, I shall now carry out the succession of the Golden Witch...!"
The instant that BEATRICE made that proclamation, a golden brilliance buried everything,
 ......and changed it into a majestic space that looked like a throne room.
In the throne room, there was a crowd of BEATRICE\'s minions and brethren, as well as countless gold butterflies,
 celebrating this first succession ceremony in a thousand years.
And there was BEATRICE, in the throne that only the Endless Witch was permitted to sit in, holding a golden staff,
 reigning with a dazzling dignity.
Without being ordered by anyone, Eva automatically kneeled, hanging her head...
A goat attendant respectfully offered BEATRICE a golden staff modeled after the One‐winged Eagle.
After BEATRICE stood up and received that staff,
 she lay the tip of it on Eva\'s shoulder and spoke.
 It was a proclamation one thousand years in coming.
"Ushiromiya Eva.
 You have spectacularly solved the riddle of the witch\'s epitaph, and reached this Golden Land.
 ......I praise that accomplishment,
 and hand over all of the Endless Magic as well as the titles of the Golden and Endless Witch."
"From this point on,
 you may take my name, BEATRICE...!
 Come, raise your face.
 Then stand and accept this staff...!"
"I, ......I am most grateful..."
Eva stood up dizzily and took the magic staff from BEATRICE\'s hand.
 Her hand was trembling slightly.
As soon as she grasped that staff...
......she was wrapped up in the brilliant sparkle of gold.
As though gold butterflies were flowing out from inside of her.
In the instant she succeeded the Golden Witch, Eva felt something in the depths of her soul be reborn.
To describe it in a word, it was energy.
Energy with a gold color.
It felt as though she had been half asleep ever since she was born,
 ......and had now awoken for the first time in her life.
For the first time in her life, she felt her true eyes inside her eyes open.
".........Mm.
 A fitting and beautiful outfit for the Golden Witch."
"Come, show yourself to all of these people.
 Show them that you are now the new witch...!"
Eva, ......no, the new BEATRICE turned around timidly.
When she did, the witch\'s minions, which filled the vast throne room,
 honored her with a wild applause that sounded like the roaring of the sea......
"Come, everyone.
 Replace all of the portraits of BEATRICE with the new BEATRICE!
 Offer up words of celebration for the new BEATRICE...!!"
"New BEATRICE.
 Congratulations on the succession of the Golden Witch.
 ...I hope that you will become able to stand on your own as a noble Golden Witch, and as the Endless Witch."
"Y‐.........yes, ...I will do my best..."
"I expect a composure fitting for the Endless Witch from you, unlike your naughty predecessor.
 Hoh‐hohohohoho."
"Masteer, we\'re in the middle of a serious ceremony, so please, enough of thaaat..."
"Congratulations on the succession of the Golden Witch.
 New BEATRICE‐sama."
"......I am called Ronove.
 I am one of the 72 demons permitted to serve the Golden Witch.
 From now on, I will always be at your service.
 If you are ever inconvenienced in the slightest, please let me know at once."
"......Th‐......thank you......"
"Ronove is rude but reliable.
 If you speak to this man of anything that confuses you in your new days as a witch, he should be able to help you."
".........And, predecessor BEATRICE‐sama,
 it is a shame that I was not permitted to serve you further, even though we have finally been reunited like this."
"......These last thousand years have been very entertaining for me.
 I deeply thank you."
"Mm.
 ......One thousand years with you wasn\'t boring.
 ...Please, take care of the new witch."
"Yes.
 If that is the final order of the predecessor BEATRICE,
 ...I, Ronove,
 shall certainly carry on your wish."
"Thank me, \'kay?
 I signed as your reference for the succession of the witch, you know?
 So basically, if I hadn\'t signed, you wouldn\'t have been able to become the witch.
 So thank me a little, alright?!"
"This is the Witch of Certainty, Lady LAMBDADELTA.
 The recommendation of a witch from the Senate was required for your succession as an Endless Witch.
 Lady LAMBDADELTA recommended you, and became your guardian."
"Th‐......thanks......"
"......Heyyy, Beatoo!
 This kid isn\'t grateful enough!
 I wanna stop recommending her!"
"Being a reference is not a thing to take lightly.
 If you\'ve signed, then you must take responsibility."
"Lady LAMBDADELTA is also the Witch of Certainty.
 ......The Witch of Certainty prefers to make fate firm, to create a fate of Certainty.
 She took a great liking to your efforts up to today, and held them in the highest regard."
"Well, an unfortunate childhood, unrewarded effort...I can sympathize juuust a bit with those, that\'s all.
 It\'s not like I felt sorry for you or anything, don\'t get so full of yourself!
 Tsuun!"
"......From my point of view, your succession, well, it\'s more of a coincidence than a miracle.
 You wouldn\'t have been worthy of my recommendation."
"*cackle*.
 This is Lady BERNKASTEL.
 She is a very hard‐to‐please person.
 Still, you could say that just having her participate and celebrate is very fortunate."
".........I only came because this is a rare event, unseen in a thousand years.
 And I heard that there would be some delicious alcohol."
"New BEATRICE‐sama.
 Please, allow us to greet you as well."
"Huh, ...ah, ...I\'m pleased to meet you..."
The Seven Sisters of Purgatory formed a line side by side.
The eldest sister, Lucifer, took a step forward and kneeled.
"These are furniture who serve me.
 As a gift in celebration of your inheritance, I will send them to you."
"......After you succeed the Golden Witch, you will need to perform the ritual for your own resurrection.
 The Seven Sisters of Purgatory perform an essential role in that ritual.
 ......They\'re a bunch of miscreants, but they serve their purpose.
 Have them do whatever you wish."
"We will always be by your side, BEATRICE‐sama.
 Please order us to do anything you wish.
 We will certainly show that we can accomplish our task...!"
Even after that, various nobles and minions visited and offered words of congratulation for the new witch.
As she responded to them confusedly,
 she felt as though she was getting light‐headed due to lack of oxygen.
......She couldn\'t tell if this was something real or unreal.
But there was just one thing she could understand.
 The feeling of achievement at being permitted to call herself the Golden Witch.
...That alone was a truth she could definitely understand...
"............What......is all this?
 Of course, I\'m not going to swallow this story, ...but what on Earth does it mean?!"
"Auntie Eva is the new BEATRICE?
 Are you saying she\'s become a witch?
 ......What the hell...!!"
"I am also surprised.
 Imagine that someone would be able to solve that riddle.
 ......However, that is the rule.
 I must follow it, and pass on the position of Golden Witch and my name."
"It is hardly something to be surprised about.
 Milady wrote that rule in a letter and announced it at the beginning.
 ......Eva‐sama was the first to be successful.
 That is all there is to say."
"......VIRGILIA, are you there?!"
"Yes, here I am..."
"What does this farce mean?!
 Even if this depiction of strange witches showing up one after another is some of her bullshit...!
 ......Isn\'t this like Auntie Eva has become a witch?!"
"Calm yourself.
 She has simply received the title of "Golden Witch", and might call herself that in the future.
 ......This succession ceremony is, without doubt, nothing more than that performed according to that child\'s "interpretation".
 Don\'t fall for the same move again."
"Th‐...that\'s right...
 That whole grand ceremony was all phony.
 But it\'s at least a fact that Auntie Eva solved the riddle of the epitaph.
 ......And at the same time, that means that she inherited the Ushiromiya family headship."
"......And by obtaining ten tons of gold,
 ......it means that Auntie Eva might as well call herself the "Golden Witch"...is that it...?
 Damn, making things as complicated as ever...!!"
"...Dear me.
 Is a boorish Human unable to comprehend the grandeur of this ceremony?
 ......Oh, well.
 Being unable to read between the lines is what makes you Human.
 I pity you, but I do not blame you."
"Damn it...
 Don\'t look at me like you feel sorry for me...
 .........Still, for the time being, there\'s something I need to check."
"And that\'s regarding this younger version of Auntie Eva,
 ...in other words, the definition of this new BEATRICE.
 ......What the heck is she?!"
"Even if I tell of it, you will just persist in your disbelief in magic and witches, will you not?
 So there is nothing in particular for me to explain.
 You may believe that things are as you think they are."
"......The way I think things are...?!
 Then, then how should I interpret this...?!"
"For now, grasping it as a visualization of a different being inside Ushiromiya Eva may not be a hindrance, I believe."
"...Of course, you cannot blindly accept it, but it is probably appropriate for you to think that way now."
"............In, in other words, I should think of Auntie Eva and her as the same person?
 ......Damn, ...this is starting to feel bad..."
"With that being the case, from now on, my name is not BEATRICE.
 Because I have passed it on to Ushiromiya Eva."
"......Which means that I am nameless!
 Battleerr, isn\'t there some name that is fitting for me?
 I shall take your recommendation!
 Isn\'t there a name that\'s refined, full of elegance, and make it a little cute if you can...!"
"...Just "Beato" is good enough for you.
 There\'s probably enough of a difference between Beato and BEATRICE."
"Mh...muu.
 Stay as Beato, is it...
 It doesn\'t feel odd, but it\'s boring for some reason.
 Muu."
"Pu ku ku ku ku...
 They say the temperature of black tea and a woman\'s heart are difficult in any time period."
".........Battler‐kun.
 In any case, handle what is to come with composure.
 Compared to when this child was BEATRICE,
 now that we can tell her apart from Ushiromiya Eva, the situation is advantageous to us."
"......And it\'s exactly because of that,
 ...that I like it even less.
 ......What is she thinking of?
 That Beato........."
Over there, Auntie Eva,
 who had the figure of her younger days and who now possessed the name BEATRICE, had a long line forming of witches wishing to bless her.
It was like a witch\'s coronation.
Countless gold butterflies flapped their wings, directing this fantastical, gold‐sparkling space.
 They were all praising her.
As I stared from the distance,
 I looked at the BEATRICE given new life, who had a slightly embarrassed smile on her face.
......Her expression, which had been hesitant at first,
 seemed to be full of a happiness that she had finally become aware of.
In that expression, there wasn\'t a trace of the madness that had led her to that insane laugh before the gold.
 There was only the innocence of relishing her joy.
Since I deny witches, I couldn\'t accept her as she showed that joyful expression at her witch succession ceremony...
......However, as I watched that innocent smile,
 ...it made me feel like I wanted to celebrate her, just for now.
The moment when a strong effort is successful and rewarded is always beautiful.
Auntie Eva, who had always yearned to succeed the head, and had worked hard since she was young without being rewarded,
 ......had spectacularly taken hold of the chance given to her by the riddle of the epitaph, ...and had finally gained that position.
How divine is the smile of a person whose childhood dreams have been granted?
I definitely won\'t accept witches.
But, ......Battler put his hands together, making a small sound.
Clap. Clap.
......It didn\'t reach her ears, ...but it did celebrate her.
".........Congratulations, Auntie Eva."
You solved the riddle of the epitaph masterfully, and before anyone else.
It\'s your victory without any complaints.
............I won\'t accept all that about the Golden Witch and so on, but I will accept you as the new head of the Ushiromiya family, and I will celebrate you honestly.
"...............Hmph."
As though lured by Battler\'s applause, Beato also clapped.
...It was a slightly odd scene.
 Because Battler and Beato, who opposed each other, were standing next to one another, applauding for the same person.
"I\'m not clapping for a witch.
 ...I\'m clapping for all of Auntie Eva\'s efforts up until now."
"I am too.
 I am offering Eva my sincere congratulations in applause for the tremendous accomplishment of solving that epitaph."
".........Hmm.
 ...I don\'t like the fact that I\'m clapping with you.
 ...But, well, I won\'t worry about it for now.
 ...I guess it doesn\'t hurt to clap with you every once in a while."
"Mmhm.
 It isn\'t bad once in a while.
 ......Still, it is fun to applaud.
 Even though it was Eva who achieved it and not me, for some reason, I\'m starting to feel happy too."
"That\'s because celebrating someone means the same thing as empathizing with their joy, and sharing in it."
"I see.
 Then, I must even be sharing this irrational happy feeling with you.
 ......Since we are a pair of enemies trying to make each other submit, it is an odd experience."
"Well, ......just for now, let\'s have a truce and clap, alright?"
Beato laughed impishly, playing around and applauding even louder,
 as though eagerly trying not to lose to Battler as she clapped.
Battler went along with her, and clapped even louder.
And when he did, as though he had ended some kind of ceremony, everyone present put their hands together in loud applause, and highly praised the newly born BEATRICE.
It was just as though Battler\'s and Beato\'s applause had been the final thing needed for her succession......
