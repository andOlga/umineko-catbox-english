"I\'ve brought Willard‐san."
"........................"
Kinzo and Genji could be seen in the VIP room.
Kinzo was sitting back in a chair, his eyes closed as though in a troubled sleep.
"......My lord.
 The guest has come to see you."
"..............................nn."
Kinzo slowly opened his eyes.
......Those eyes were red from crying.
They regained their focus and slowly fell on Will.
"......I am...Ushiromiya Kinzo."
"......Will."
"I\'m Willard.
 Allow me to express my condolences."
"......So, you\'ve come to visit Beatrice\'s funeral.
 ......Just who are you?"
"I\'m no one. I have no connections with anyone.
 Don\'t think too deeply about it.
 You\'ll just get a headache.
 .........Ow."
"I ask that you choose your words a little more carefully."
"......Hmph, what a strange guest.
 So?
 What business do you have with me?"
"I want to ask about Beatrice."
"What..................?"
Kinzo\'s gaze grew sharp.
Lion felt a bit lightheaded and wondered why this guy had to be so direct.
"Why do you ask?
 I thought you were no one.
 Why do you want to know about Beatrice?
 What purpose could it serve?"
"Because I am no one,
 I can listen to your tale without bias and record it.
 You will probably leave this world before too long.
 If you die without telling anything about Beatrice,
 your children will adorn her with their own fanciful tales and write them into history."
"Pft, hahahahahahahahahaha!
 You entertain me, boy.
 You think yourself a testament taker?!"
"But that is wholly unnecessary.
 Beatrice is mine alone.
 No matter what anyone says,
 no one can defile our story. What they say is of no consequence!
 No matter how Krauss and the others misconstrue it, it matters nothing to me!"
"......Willard‐sama.
 The Master does not like wills.
 He is not one to abandon anything while he still lives."
"......Probably true.
 I thought it sounded a bit unlike him."
"The spirit to struggle onward to our dying breaths is what makes us human!
 The idea that I would give up before my time and leave behind a will is laughably absurd!"
"Yes, that does sound a bit more like you.
 ......It\'s not your style to ask someone to write about the past just because you feel you might die soon."
"......We know how deeply you loved Beatrice‐sama.
 You are the model most worthy of respect that any of us know, and an example for us to follow in every aspect of our lives."
"Please, for the sake of us wandering souls,
 may we learn of how you loved her to the last, how your love for her guided you through life,
 ......and the strength of your love for her, so that your story might guide us through our own lives...?"
"You\'re pretty good at this."
"It\'s your fault for being so tactless."
"Boy.
 What do you know of Beatrice?
 A truly ignorant person would not hold any interest at all.
 The mere fact that you know her name shows that you are neither ignorant nor unconnected."
"Good point.
 ......The Beatrice I know of...
is the woman you loved, the one you met before the mansion on Rokkenjima was even built.
 However, she probably departed from this world, leaving behind a daughter.
 That is the girl who was raised in Kuwadorian."
".........Oho."
"Willard‐sama.
 There is no building known as Kuwadorian on Rokkenjima."
"......That name, Kuwadorian...
 ...You mentioned it when we were talking with Aunt Rosa too.
 ......What in the world does it mean?"
"You should have an idea by now.
 It\'s the name of the hidden mansion deep in the forest where his mistress\'s daughter lived."
"Interesting.
 ......So, you actually know the name of Kuwadorian.
 ......Continue. You have sparked my interest."
Kinzo shrugged and grinned......
"The one living in Kuwadorian was probably Beatrice\'s daughter.
 However, it seems that you didn\'t think of her that way."
"Oho.
 ......Then how did I think of her?"
"When Ushiromiya Rosa went to Kuwadorian, Beatrice told her a little about herself.
 ......In that conversation, she referred to you as Kinzo.
 It was the same when she spoke to you directly."
"Though she said that she thought of you as a father, she didn\'t call you Father.
 ......She either didn\'t call you that, or she wasn\'t allowed to call you that.
 That can only mean one thing."
"And what might that be......?"
"Reincarnation.
 You didn\'t think of your daughter as a child Beatrice left behind.
 You believed that the dead Beatrice had revived into a new body.
 ......Genji.
 Once in the past, you spoke in front of Natsuhi and several other family members,
 stating that there had never been a child between Kinzo and Beatrice."
".........I have no memory of saying this."
Of course, "this game\'s" Genji probably wouldn\'t remember that.
However, near the end of the first game, when the survivors all gathered in Kinzo\'s study...
...Genji was asked whether Kinzo and Beatrice ever had a child together,
 and he denied it, saying "I have not heard of anything like that".
"‘I have not heard that’... In a way, it was a perfect sort of answer for one of Kinzo\'s confidants.
 ......After all, in Kinzo\'s eyes, she wasn\'t a daughter,
 but Beatrice reborn."
"Will...!
 I don\'t know what you\'re talking about, but I will not let you slander the family head!"
"This isn\'t slander.
 It\'s reasoning.
 ......However, I understand the heart.
 Beatrice was the woman you loved most.
 She remained that way even after death, for all eternity, and without fading in the slightest."
"However, given the child\'s blue eyes, beautiful blonde hair, and facial features which resembled Beatrice from a young age,
 if you had gradually begun to think that she might actually be Beatrice reborn,
 that wouldn\'t be surprising."
"...............My lord.
 Shall I...?"
Shall I throw this insolent man out?
 Genji asked Kinzo.
For a while, Kinzo hung his head in silence, as though remembering something from his own past.
"Your daughter grew to be beautiful and nearly identical to her mother.
 You must have been ecstatic.
 However, it\'s doubtful that you were fully satisfied by this.
 ......After all, though she was Beatrice reborn to you,
 she didn\'t feel that way herself."
"......How can you know that?"
"She couldn\'t shake the feeling that there was something out of place about her being called Beatrice.
 ......People never feel anything out of place about the name they were given at the time of their birth.
 However, she did have that feeling.
 That must mean that she was aware that the name "Beatrice" was not hers."
In Kuwadorian, she asked both Kinzo and Rosa about who she was.
— Who am I?
 ......Everyone calls me BEATRICE.
 ...And that does certainly seem to be the name of a great witch, as you say.
— ......But that is not me.
 I cannot use any magic.
 ......I simply have the soul of that witch sealed inside my body.
"........................Her memory...
would have returned.
 ......She was without a doubt Beatrice reborn.
 ......Her memory was coming back bit by bit.
 My magical rituals were helping her regain her memories one little bit at a time......"
"G‐......Grandfather......"
"There\'s no need to be surprised.
 If you line up the information in all the games so far, this is the answer it leads you to.
 ......The Beatrice on the higher plane talked about this in metaphor, saying that Kinzo refused to let the witch\'s soul escape even after death, and instead caught it and locked it up in a body of flesh.
 She also said that her power and memory had been sealed.
 If you match that interpretation of hers to this theory, it all makes sense."
"............Willard‐sama.
 Thanks to a powerful magical ritual, the Master gained a reborn child of the late Beatrice‐sama.
 That cannot be denied."
"I won\'t contradict the stork.
 And I don\'t intend to doubt the depths of Kinzo\'s love for this woman called Beatrice.
 .........It\'s no one\'s business how a person chooses to show their affection towards their only living reminder of the departed.
 If she grew to look more and more like Beatrice, and Kinzo\'s love gave rise to a new, special emotion,
 I find that a very human reaction."
".........You think...
...you can understand my love.........?"
"I\'m not qualified to understand it.
 However, I\'m also not qualified to deny it."
"..................Oooh,
 ......Beatrice......
 ......Please,
 .........forgive me........."
Kinzo sobbed quietly for a while, wiping away his tears...
Because of love,
 he believed she was Beatrice reborn,
 and raised her that way.
However, somewhere in his heart,
 ......he might have felt...
...pangs of conscience,
 telling him that he might be forcing his emotions on someone who wasn\'t really Beatrice.
Then, the Beatrice of Kuwadorian had an unexpected guest, Rosa.
Unable to believe that she was the Beatrice that Kinzo desired,
 and suffering from her inability to understand who she was, she expressed a desire to escape to the outside world.
Then, ............she fell from the cliff...and died.
"Genji handled that death, which couldn\'t become public knowledge, very quietly."
"...................................."
"Funerals aren\'t for the dead.
 ......They exist so that those who are alive can sever their ties with the dead.
 ......You could never do that.
 That\'s why it festered within you."
"......Beatrice......
...ooooooooohhhh......"
"G‐......Grandfather........."
"You lost your mistress\'s—
no, you lost Beatrice twice.
 Unable to let that sorrow show on the outside, you kept it locked up in your heart,
 ......and it eventually festered and turned to madness.
 That\'s what spurred on your abnormally strong interest in the occult in your later years."
"Oooooooooohhhh!!
 Beatriceeeeee, Beatriceeeeee!!
 Why?!!
 Why did you leave me twice?!
 Your smile,
 that beautiful hair,
 those eyes...
 ......Why did you die in my arms not once,
 ......but twice?!"
"Is that how much...
...how much you...
......ooooooohhhh,
 oooooooooooooooooooooooohhhh...oohhh..."
By now, Kinzo wasn\'t even trying to suppress his sobs.
Sometimes, he scratched at his head in anguish;
 other times, he faced the heavens like an opera singer.
Kinzo yelled over and over again, repeating Beatrice\'s name......
At that moment, there was a quiet sound of a door closing.
......When they turned around, she was already there.
Kumasawa had appeared.
".........If they already know that much,
 perhaps we can tell them the rest...?"
"......Though, if they know that much,
 I don\'t believe there is anything more to tell..."
"No, we should tell them.
 As a woman,
 ......I\'ve always thought that the heart of Kuwadorian\'s Beatrice is a story that should be told.
 And now, someone has appeared who is worthy to hear it.
 I believe that now is the time to tell all, without holding back."
".............................."
"Kumasawa‐san, do you know something?
 About Beatrice......?"
"Of course she does.
 ......In the fourth game, we have testimony from the ferryboat captain saying that Kumasawa went in and out of Kuwadorian.
 I\'d be willing to bet that Kumasawa had different work shifts at the mansion and Kuwadorian.
 There was a young girl to be taken care of.
 Kumasawa, with her long experience in taking care of children, must have been of immense value."
".........That is correct.
 You might even call me her wet nurse."
"No way......
 ......I can\'t believe it.
 ......So, ......everything Will‐san is saying is the truth."
".........Yes.
 It is a fact.
 ......There was a secret mansion constructed on the opposite side of the island for Beatrice‐sama.
 The existence of Kuwadorian is the truth."
"I don\'t know when Kinzo married his official wife,
 but back when Kinzo already had an enormous store of wealth and had bought Rokkenjima whole,
 he built two mansions and set up two separate lives."
Kinzo\'s children had also been aware of Kinzo\'s clandestine eccentricities at the time.
It probably hadn\'t been easy to set up two lives.
Moreover, Kinzo\'s wife had been suspicious and had sniffed around all the time...
"The Master stayed in Kuwadorian as much as time allowed.
 He would sometimes pretend to go on a business trip and stay there for several days,
 treasuring the time he spent with Beatrice‐sama.
 ......It was not simply a father‐daughter relationship.
 You could sometimes catch a glimpse of his great love for the late Beatrice‐sama, and it was a heart‐warming thing."
"The way you say it makes it sound like he sometimes treated her...
...as a substitute for Beatrice."
"Oho.
 If it sounded that way, my apologies.
 ......Beatrice‐sama probably accepted her father\'s love.
 However, I will not deny...
that she was sometimes forced to bear a love she didn\'t understand."
Kumasawa\'s tone made it sound as though she was scolding Kinzo.
As a mother who had raised many kids, Kumasawa had probably spotted that Kinzo\'s love was often of a mistaken sort.
However, the more the girl grew to look like her mother,
 the more distorted and twisted Kinzo\'s heart became......
Because of his deep love,
 it grew very,
 very...
...twisted......
".........You are right to scold me, my friend.
 ............I understand.
 My love is eternal and undying.
 ......However, there were times when I directed it at the wrong person, and...
...I...
...must acknowledge that......"
"......Grandfather...
 .........Wait, ......you don\'t mean......"
"Lion‐sama.
 All humans in this world are tied to each other.
 Even if they do not notice, there is always some sort of tie.
 Those ties......wrap themselves around people and bring them together."
"No way...............
 ............Grandfather..............."
Just as Kinzo had done, Lion also wiped away tears and stared down at the floor.
Apparently, the truth had been too much of a shock for the young successor to handle...
"......My lord.
 Perhaps the time has come to speak of it."
"..............................
 ......I see.
 So, that time has come, ......my friend."
"Unless you tell us,
 none of the truth will become clear."
".........My lord.
 ......I believe they may have the qualifications and the right to know."
"I know.
 Perhaps on this day of my fickle funeral, Beatrice in heaven has given me a chance to atone...
 .........Forgive me for not telling you this before now."
After taking a deep breath, Kinzo finally lowered the hands that had been covering his face,
 ......and looked at Will and Lion with those red eyes.
"..........................."
"..................Grandfather..."
"You listen too, Lion.
 ......Guest.
 Willard, was it?"
"Yeah."
".........I thank you for giving me a chance to speak of the truth while I still am able.
 ......You must surely be a messenger from heaven sent by Beatrice...
 ......You have my gratitude........."
"Beatrice isn\'t the one you have to thank.
 It was some witch.
 ......Well, I guess they\'re both witches..."
"Hmph, ......I do not care who it was.
 I have been given a chance.
 That is enough.
 ......Thank you, Willard."
Kinzo slowly stood up and held out his right hand.
He was offering to shake hands.
It must have been Kinzo\'s way of expressing his gratitude...
Will responded.
Then, the two hands gripped each other tightly in silence.
When they did, ......a bright light poured out from the gap between the two hands.
"..................nn—"
Will felt as though something the size of a grain had burned itself into his palm.
......It was that power that BERNKASTEL had given him.
The light grew brighter and brighter.
However, it seemed that Kinzo and the others could not see it.
"......Now, I will speak.
 I met Beatrice—
Beatrice Castiglioni—just before the end of the war.
 She came from across the sea......"
"................................."
"......So, are you Kinzo?"
"It\'s how Grandfather looked in the past.
 I\'ve seen photos.
 ......Just what on Earth......"
"It\'s the theatergoing power that BERNKASTEL gave me.
 ......Don\'t try to understand."
"I\'ll just get a headache?"
"You\'re getting the hang of this."
At one time, Genji told Battler that he looked like Kinzo in his youth.
Sure enough, though the young Kinzo wasn\'t exactly the same as Battler, they looked very similar.
".........Allow me to introduce myself again.
 ......I am Ushiromiya Kinzo."
"Grandfather........."
Even the voice seemed to resemble Battler\'s somehow.
Clearly, Battler had inherited Kinzo\'s blood more thickly than any other...
"I did not want to succeed the Ushiromiya family headship.
 ......My being chosen as the head was nothing more than a prank of fate."
"......In the Great Kanto Earthquake, those in charge passed away, and you were selected from the branch families."
"That\'s correct.
 After all, Grandfather was wise despite his youth, and he already possessed a dignity fitting for the headship."
"Fuhahahahahahahaha......
 Ridiculous.
 ......Those greedy elders were so intent on looking out for their own personal interests that they couldn\'t even decide on a new head.
 They were like fools arguing about who the new captain should be on a sinking ship."
"So, since you had no connections with anyone in the main family, you were selected right out of the blue."
"It\'s all because of my toes.
 If only I\'d had one fewer toe on each foot, my life may have turned out quite differently......"
In the Ushiromiya family, polydactyly was seen as a sign of good fortune.
This was because it was a common factor among many of the greats in the family\'s history.
"It was all very pathetic.
 The elders didn\'t care whom they dragged in as long as it wouldn\'t favor any of them over the others."
"So, they just happened to hear that someone in one of the branch families had six toes,
 and decided that would do well enough."
"Precisely.
 The elders didn\'t care what sort of novice became the head,
 as long as they could make him their puppet.
 In fact, the more ignorant this person was of how to lead, the better it would be for them."
"......Grandfather......"
"Lion.
 It is quite different in your case.
 ......You will be the one who inherits everything I have.
 That is the fate you were granted on the day of your birth.
 That is why I gave you that silver ring and raised you so strictly.
 ......You are quite different from me.
 You are already a splendid successor, of whom no one could be ashamed......"
"...Y‐......yes, sir......"
"A puppet heir, huh...
 ...I doubt that could\'ve been easy."
".........Heh,
 ......hehahahahahahahahaha..."
As he pondered about where to begin, Kinzo laughed bitterly.
It would probably bring back nothing but painful memories no matter where he started from...
"It......lasted for so long, that span of gray days.
 That mind‐numbing stretch of time I spent dead passed like moss growing on a rock......"
I became the rope in the tug of war between the elders, who thought of nothing but their own profit,
 .....and I probably could have snapped at any moment.
However, people are far more resilient than one would think.
Though I spent so many days like a dead man, ......I was not killed.
So, I would have to search for death on my own......
The next thing I knew, I had reached the age when I could no longer refer to myself as "young" without drawing laughter from those who were.
They were long, dreary, gray days without any substance.
And they lasted for a full twenty years.
In twenty years, a person can be born, find a purpose, and even become their own man with their own place in the world.
In short, .....if one truly becomes a human only when they have become a working adult...
...then I spent an amount of time long enough to create a human...
...doing nothing except playing the part of puppet to those greedy old men.
Ironically, though that time aged my body, it did not age my mind.
In my heart, I was still young,
 and I looked back fondly on the fulfilling days before I was summoned to Odawara.
Only my body continued to age, and at some point, the gulf between the two had widened to the point that it was hard to comprehend.
So, I could hardly believe that the worn‐out man in the mirror was really me.
No, it really wasn\'t me.
I was the "head of the Ushiromiya family" in name only.
I had no rights,
 no autonomy.
 There was no need for me to do anything other than what was asked of me.
I was just a doll sitting there on the shelf, gathering dust.
I remember nothing but lazily flipping through Western books I liked, locking myself in my own world,
 ......doing nothing but playing with roses and drinking terrible drinks.
And it lasted a full twenty years.
Before I knew it...
...I had a stranger for a wife.
 ......It wasn\'t any wife I had chosen.
She was someone that the elders had chosen and forced on me for their own reasons, the daughter of some noble family or something,
 ......but that hardly mattered to me.
I did not love my wife, but neither did I dislike her.
......I just didn\'t care.
I fathered a few children, but that wasn\'t out of love for my wife.
They were just born before I knew it.
 ......That\'s all there was to it.
None of it mattered.
 No, that\'s not quite right.
......Everything was decided by someone other than me, and I simply obeyed.
That was the job...
......of the "Ushiromiya family head"......
"On some level, I felt as though my life was being slowly and quietly snuffed out."
"I can\'t believe it.
 You have always been praised for being such a bold and wise ruler, and yet you lived like that for so long......"
"......Lion.
 There is nothing so long and insubstantial as a life you do not live for yourself.
 And yet, it passes in a blink.
 ......Take this to heart."
"A life...you live for yourself......"
"Living means having your own will.
 ......You probably were dead during that time."
"Precisely.
 I wanted to live.
 No, I wanted to die.
 ......What must a puppet do to die?"
".....................
 ......Cut...the strings."
"Correct.
 That would be death, it would be life, and it would be...
...release."
Before I realized it, the world had grown troubled.
World War II.
 The Pacific War.
Japan had extended their war fronts too far to the East and West, and the tide of war was changing.
Thanks to the influence of the elders, I was able to avoid conscription.
......Of course, this was not out of compassion for me.
 It was because I was their precious puppet.
So, the war never really felt that close to me.
However, when I personally decided to abandon their protection, it was very easy.
At that time, the Ushiromiya family had almost completely collapsed,
 and since the elders had apparently pilfered enough of the scraps to last them the rest of their lives,
 they seemed to care little for what I did, now that they no longer had any use for me.
So, I realized that I had finally found my time to die.
One by one,
 I cut the threads I was hanging from,
 ......and began to search...
...for a place to end my life.
"So, you searched for death on the battlefield?"
"......I thought that if I was going to die anyway, I should try to be of some use to someone.
 ......No, that\'s a lie.
 I probably just lacked the willpower to end my own life.
 War was a suitable excuse for death."
"I heard that your knowledge in public works and construction...
led to you being tasked with setting up facilities for the Navy construction team."
"Hmph, and what a miscalculation that was.
 If I had just said that I had no useful skills, I would have been sent to the front lines where I could die at a moment\'s notice..."
"So, you ended up not having to go to the front lines?"
"Some of the others were overjoyed at their luck.
 It was the opposite for me.
 My only desire was to get my hands on the intoxicating liquor of battle and drink myself to death.
 ......The US planes did nothing but cut across the skies of that forsaken island.
 ......They didn\'t have even a bullet to spare for me, much less a bomb."
"Is this the time you met Beatrice, Grandfather......?"
"Correct.
 She came to me from the sea......"
"Where did you meet her?
 You mentioned an island."
"It was here.
 She came to this island."
"......So, you met here, on Rokkenjima?"
"What\'s going on...?
 ......I heard that Rokkenjima was uninhabited until you bought it, Grandfather.
 I never knew there was a Japanese military base here."
"Pft, hahahahahahahaha......
 Ah, yes, you could hardly call that a military base.
 It was just a cave.
 I was one of the guards of that cave."
1944.
Due to the honorable defeats at Saipan and Guam, Japan\'s Absolute National Defense Zone strategy was in shambles.
Where had the gallantry of the start of the war gone?
The old attackers were now the ones on the defensive.
At that time, it was said that the final trump cards for the Japanese military were the so‐called "special attack weapons".
It was said that these ultimate weapons were packed with 1.55 tons of explosives...
and capable of sinking any kind of warship with a single blast.
To strengthen homeland defense,
 the Navy drafted a plan to build a string of hidden bases from Hachijojima to Yokosuka, all to house submarines loaded with special attack weapons.
"I knew that there was a base constructed on Hachijojima.
 To think there was one on Rokkenjima too......"
"Just what sort of fool decided it would be a good idea to plant a base on this desolate island, I have no idea.
 ......To better preserve its secrecy?
 Hmph, ridiculous.
 ......I could never understand what the higher‐ups were thinking, and I didn\'t particularly care."
These truly were ultimate weapons, able to take down large warships in a single strike.
It was hoped that the presence of submarines capable of loading these weapons in the waters just off of Japan would allow for a powerful sea ambush as a final line of defense.
So, to aid in the establishment of a base with absolute secrecy, the uninhabited island Rokkenjima was raised as a possible candidate.
An investigation of the island resulted in the discovery of a large cave in the cliffs,
 and this was apparently deemed to be a suitable location for a submarine base.
"So, you were tasked with aiding in the establishment of that base?"
"Establishment?
 Certainly, if you can call digging out a cave "establishment".
 Not only that, the base was abandoned before its completion."
"Why?"
"Wahahahahaha!
 Because at that time, Japan no longer had any submarines large enough to carry one of those weapons.
 How truly laughable.
 What\'s the point in having a submarine base if there aren\'t any submarines left?
 If there\'s one thing that never changes, it\'s politicians and their meaningless projects."
The base on Hachijojima was actually outfitted with those weapons and became a base for direct attacks,
 but Rokkenjima was never supplied with any.
Not only that, they cancelled the construction work entirely,
 leaving only a crew of minimal size stationed on the island, waiting for orders from above that never came.
Could it be the fact that it was a hidden base sealed our fate?
The higher‐ups had already completely forgotten about this useless and pointless cavern.
We were nothing more than guards for a mere cave.
We spent our days farming, fishing, and playing with the dirt,
 all the while gazing up at the American formations flying past.
......Some of our group were relieved at the prospect of the war ending before anyone remembered we were here...
and before any of us had to face a real battle.
Of course, it was the opposite for me.
I hoped beyond hope for the American troops to advance and kill me as soon as possible.
And then, on one of those hollow days...
Let us go back there now.
......Back to the turning point in my life and my fate,
 ......when Ushiromiya Kinzo finally became alive......
