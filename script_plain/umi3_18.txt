...Even though it was a pitch‐black world where nothing could be seen,
 ......for some reason, I felt Beato\'s presence right next to me.
......So I tried calling out to her.
...You can exchange words with someone whether they\'re a human or a witch.
......So even in a world where witches have been denied......I should be allowed to talk to her...
"...............Beato......"
"......Battler, is it...
 ...............It is done.
 ......I...did it."
"...Yeah.
 ......I didn\'t hear it,
 .........but I watched you...until the very end...
 I was watching......as you boldly stood up to that evil witch..."
".........With this, ...I am no longer a witch.
 ............But, I will definitely...become a witch again...
 ......And...
...I will make it so that I can be called the Golden Witch again,
 .........and then,
 ......when I am ready to be accepted as your opponent,
 .........I will return once more......"
"No.
 .........You...were a witch."
"...............Huh......?"
"...I...was watching.
 .........When you took that evil witch,
 ......and blew her away with that awesome magic, exposing her true form,
 ...I was watching with my own eyes..."
"Th‐...that wasn\'t magic,
 ......but the red—"
"No, it was magic.
 .........You were definitely...the Golden Witch.
 .........Even if you deny it yourself,
 .........I\'ll accept it.
 ............‘You are definitely...
the Golden Witch’."
.........When Battler said those words...
In the world that had been dark, ...there was suddenly a single grain.
...A small grain of gold, like a wheat seed, shone brightly.
...Even though it was small, it had a strong, gold‐colored glow.
And......it illuminated the two of them, sitting with their backs together...
So they each became aware of their own form.
...They did not exist only as consciousness.
......They became aware that they had bodies, and definitely existed.
...No, maybe we should say that they each had been given an existence called a body.
When Battler looked at his own form, he wasn\'t that surprised.
...But when Beato looked at her own form, she was a little startled.
......From Battler\'s perspective, she looked just like normal,
 ......but for a short while, she was surprised by that form...
".........What............
......is going on.........?"
"The glow from that grain of light......is getting stronger and stronger..."
That grain of wheat was no longer simply gold‐colored, but was like the light of the sun.
Then, it softly.........began to approach Beato\'s chest.
When that grain of the sun......was sucked inside her chest...
......the world became wrapped in a deep blue sky, and then a deep blue ocean spread out below them.
An island rose up, trees sprouted and created a forest, walls surrounded us and a ceiling swallowed us.
And it became adorned with more and more things,
 ......until we realized that this was the hall in the Ushiromiya mansion.
In that fantastical hall where many gold butterflies beat their wings,
 ...many tables were set up with white tablecloths, like it was a party,
 and beautiful cooking and fruits were set out.
...And over there......were a great many figures.
Everyone was there, talking together and smiling.
"G‐............guys........."
There was Dad and Kyrie‐san, Uncle Krauss, Aunt Natsuhi and Auntie Rosa, and of course, even Auntie Eva and Uncle Hideyoshi.
......George‐aniki, Jessica, Maria, ...wait, wait, even Shannon‐chan, Kanon‐kun, Gohda‐san and Kumasawa‐san are here.
Everyone, everyone was at the party, clapping their hands and celebrating our return...
"Wh‐...why...?
 Everyone was dead...!
 Why are they alive...?!"
"......In the Golden Land, all the dead people\'s souls can be revived.
 ......Welcome back, BEATRICE.
 And welcome, Battler‐kun.
 Welcome to the Golden Land."
"............I...made it?
 ...I made it...
to the door of the Golden Land?"
"Yes.
 ......Milady, you have finally been able to invite everyone to the Golden Land.
 ...Welcome, Battler‐sama, to the Golden Land."
"Battler.
 .........So, you have finally made it this far."
"G‐Grandfather...
 .........Where in the world...am I..."
"...My blood, which is...incompatible with magic, runs more deeply in your veins than any other.
 ...Therefore, you were the only one who could not reach the Golden Land, and BEATRICE has been searching for you ever since.
 ...She tried everything to bring you here."
"............What did you say......?"
"It seems that we are all here at last."
"Battler‐sama, if you would take your seat.
 Tonight\'s dinner is my very best work.
 If you would, please relish it."
"You should be honored!!
 Normally, I would have eaten all of it, but I left you guys some out of pity!"
"......The seven stake babes..."
"In the Golden Land, all of those with minds are equal.
 ......Here, there is no distinction between us furniture, {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s, or witches."
"...Battler‐sama.
 We were waiting for you.
 And welcome to the Golden Land..."
"Shannon‐chan, ......George‐aniki...!!"
"......I\'m still suspecting that this might be a dream...
 I\'m sure that we died.
 ......But, ...we\'re alive.
 And everyone, every one of us is here, ......and we\'re all happy.
 ...I can\'t believe it."
"That\'s right, this place must be a dream worrld!
 So it doesn\'t matter that George is so friendly with a maid girl, it has to be a dreeeam!
 Waaaaaah!"
"Give it a rest, Eva.
 For now, you gotta stay quiet and bless the two young \'uns.
 The Golden Land is a capital of bliss.
 We should never quarrel here...!"
"Here, any people are free to love each other.
 ...No one needs to hesitate over it."
"Jessica‐chan, Kanon‐kun, so wonderfuul!
 I\'m so jealouuus!"
"......H‐hey, Battler...
 This is kinda, umm, wahahahaha..."
"Battler‐sama, welcome.
 And welcome home..."
Jessica was probably embarrassed because she was holding hands with Kanon‐kun.
And Kanon‐kun wanted to act humbly like a servant and bow,
 but since neither of them could let go of the other\'s hand, he couldn\'t do it so well, and the whole scene looked fairly comical.
"With a servant child...?!!
 I forbid it, I couldn\'t possibly give away our Jessica to such a person...!!"
"Why not allow it?
 Let her at least choose the person she likes."
"I forbid it, I forbid it, aaaaaaaaaahhh, Jessicaaaaaaaaa!"
"Mine has gone awry toooooo, ohhhhh, Geooooooooorge!"
...As Aunt Natsuhi and Auntie Eva hugged each other, they cried tears of regret for their darling children.
......Even though they had always been at odds.
 ...It was a very bizarre scene.
"......It isn\'t really a problem, right?
 It doesn\'t matter who likes who."
"Exactly.
 It\'s proof the parent hasn\'t let go of their child."
"Battleer,
 you can bring home whatever kind of woman you want, I\'ll accept her waaarmly, alright?"
"You can\'t introduce her to this guy, you know?
 He\'ll get his hands on her immediately.
 He\'ll elope right away."
"............Battler.
 You finally came here.
 Kihhihihihihihihihi."
"Maria...
 .........From the beginning,
 .........you knew that we would be coming here......?"
"Uu!
 That\'s why I wasn\'t scared at all.
 Everyone was a fraidy‐cat.
 It was funny!"
"......What the hell.
 ...Even though I thought you were the most screwed up,
 ...you actually knew the truth from the beginning."
"H‐how rude...!
 It is absolutely unforgivable to speak of Lady MARIA in that way!"
"Forming firing curve, attack preparations ready.
 Lady MARIA, we can attack at any time.
 Nihi!"
"Kihhihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi...!
 Ouch!"
"...Quiet.
 You are in the presence of BEATRICE‐sama."
"Well, there\'s no need to be quite so strict.
 For now, let us take their desire to fool around and play together into consideration.
 More importantly, why don\'t we begin preparing for the toast?"
"Yes, I have finished preparing my excellent mackerel cooking.
 I can serve it at any time."
"Hey!! Ladies!
 Work a little more like furniture!!"
"Nooooo!!
 I wanna stuff myself some mooore!
 Wahhhhhhh!"
"Come on, let\'s work.
 Don\'t keep the guests waiting.
 Let\'s work studiously and attend to them.
 Don\'t let the guests do anything.
 Make them lazy, make them slothful, fatten them like pigs.
 Ahhahaha!"
"......BEATRICE.
 Battler‐kun.
 This way."
Grandfather and VIRGILIA were standing on the landing at the top of the staircase, beckoning us.
Beato and I looked at each other quizzically, then climbed the stairs together.
From the hall, it looked like a very high stage.
A small table had been set up there, as well as a piece of parchment and an old‐fashioned quill pen.
I saw that strange magical characters and Japanese were written side by side.
...And below it, many names were written.
There were 17 of them.
 ......Grandfather was the first, and everyone else\'s names had been signed below in one long column.
The people who arrived at the Golden Land probably signed this one after another.
"Battler.
 Now that you are here, everyone is gathered.
 Listen carefully."
"The Golden Land is not a world supported by the power of magic alone.
 The cooperation and approval of all humans who receive happiness here is required.
 For that sake, we must gather the signatures of everyone here."
"Last time,
 the door to the Golden Land was finally opened, but you refused to sign.
 ......Although you probably don\'t remember it.
 Because you refused to sign, this world was once again sealed in darkness."
"......Just hearing it like that, ...it kinda sounds like I\'ve been the only stubborn one,
 and I\'ve been causing everyone all kinds of trouble..."
"That is because you are a certified hardhead.
 It seems that you inherited more than just blood from Kinzo."
Beato laughed amiably.
 I knew I was being made fun of, but that smile led me to go along with her, and I laughed without thinking.
"Magic is a miracle.
 ......Miracles cannot be completed unless everyone believes.
 ......And when you do, as the last to do so, this miracle—the Golden Land—will be completed."
"..................It looks like I\'ve been a real pain.
 ...So, what should I do...?"
"First, sign here.
 Then, BEATRICE, sign here."
"......It\'s hard to use a quill pen.
 ...Whoa, it shot."
"You klutz.
 Shooting ink is a bad omen.
 Can\'t you at least write your name quickly?
 In that illegible scrawl.
 *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*...!"
"And what about you...!
 Don\'t write it in capitals like that!
 BEATRICE is a stylish name, so write it in cursive!
 You\'re making the quill and your name cry!"
"Sh‐shut up, in school, didn\'t they tell you not to use cursive on tests?"
"This is a solemn ceremony. Be silent."
"Very good.
 We have gathered the two signatures, as well as the form for the covenant.
 ......Both of you, your oath please.
 We\'ll start with BEATRICE.
 Put your hand on the covenant, and take the oath."
"......‘I, BEATRICE, as a good witch, swear to continue with my training for the sake of bringing happiness to the people’.
 ...Say it."
"......M‐......mm...
 ......I‐it\'s a little embarrassing."
"......I, B‐BEATRICE, as a good witch,
 swear to continue with my training for the sake of bringing happiness to the people.
 ......Is that alright?"
"Good.
 Battler is next."
"In the same way, Battler‐kun.
 Put your hand on the covenant, and take the oath.
 ......‘I, Ushiromiya Battler, as a member of the Golden Land, swear to serve for the sake of bringing happiness to myself and my neighbor’."
"Ah,
 ...I, Ushiromiya Battler,
 as a member of the Golden Land, swear to serve for the sake of bringing happiness to myself and my neighbor.
 ......I\'m embarrassed too..."
"Hear me, one and all...!!
 Here and now, we have gathered the oaths of all 18 humans accepting the Golden Land...!!"
When Kinzo proclaimed that, everyone applauded at once, praising us.
......Since I\'d been the only stubborn one and had just been a nuisance, I felt a little bad about being the most celebrated one.
"And with that, in accordance with the ancient rites, we ask Battler‐kun, the last to make the oath, to sign the invitation to the Golden Land.
 ......This is something that invites the Golden Witch, BEATRICE, to the Golden Land.
 The Golden Land invites the Golden Witch through a consensus of those who have accepted it, and becomes complete."
"Battler, I will read it out loud.
 Listen carefully.
 ............‘The 18 of us acknowledge the Golden Witch to be BEATRICE, and welcome her to the Golden Land’."
"What\'s going on with you? You won\'t be invited unless I send an invitation?"
"It seems that is the ceremony.
 It makes me uncomfortable also.
 Why don\'t we end it quickly?
 I\'ve been so hungry for a while now."
"......Come to think of it, I\'ve only been pecking at canned food and haven\'t eaten anything good.
 Let\'s get this thing signed and be done with it."
"Let\'s see here.
 "We accept you as a witch".
 .........Huh?
 That\'s pretty simple.
 Damn you, Grandfather, exaggerating how it actually says it."
"Come on, come on, quickly."
"Sign, right here."
"............huh...?"
"Quickly."
"Sign."
......With slightly weird and uncomfortable smiles, the two of them started demanding that I sign...
At that time, an incredible sound like that of a glass window breaking reverberated through the hall,
 and the bustling tumult melted back into complete silence.
I dropped the quill pen and turned around, trying to see what had happened.
When I did,
 ...............where had she come from?
...A human who clearly hadn\'t been there a short while ago was in the very center of the hall, ...looking up at us.
Who\'s that......?
 ......A woman?
She\'s probably about the same age as Jessica and me.
......But I didn\'t know that face.
None of the other people here knew that face either.
"......Wh‐......who are you?!
 Who is this?!
 Where did you come from?!
 Those without invitations are not needed in my party.
 Servants, throw her out!!"
"As you command!!
 Surround her!!"
The Seven Sisters of Purgatory surrounded her from seven directions, taking out magic blades that drew purple trails and blocking her.
And from out of nowhere, shuffling goat‐head servants appeared in great numbers, surrounding that woman.
On top of that, the Chiester Sisters stood in front of Beato like a wall, readying a golden bow and pulling back the bowstring...
"......................................."
But the woman didn\'t move at all.
...On the contrary, she was still staring at us on the landing, not paying them the slightest bit of attention.
......Who is she looking at...?
 Beato?
 Grandfather?
............It couldn\'t be......me.........?
Yes.
 ...The woman was staring straight into my eyes, ...glaring.
Then, after our eyes met perfectly, she yelled.
"You must not sign that!!!
 Are you going to accept your own defeat?!
 Don\'t be tricked by the witch!!!"
"......Huh?
 By the witch,
 ......huh?!"
Just then, something incredibly strong lifted me by the nape of my neck.
...Wh‐what\'s going on...?!
And after I was forced to turn around,
 ......I saw VIRGILIA with an eerie smile on her face, and the muscular forms of goat monsters...
A goat monster that looked like it was two meters tall was holding me up with an arm as thick as a log...!
"Hohhohohohohohohohohohoho...
 There is no need to listen to an uninvited guest.
 Come, give your signature as well.
 On this written oath.
 "Ushiromiya Battler accepts the existence of witches".
 Come now, sign the written oath...!!"
"Ow, ...owowowowowowowowowowowow!!
 D‐damn it, let go!!!"
As the goat monsters constricted me with the power of a vise, they forced me to grab the quill pen.
...I couldn\'t even touch the floor with my feet, much less resist...!
"Battleer, why are you resistiiiing?
 Weren\'t you just about to sign willinglyyy...?
 Don\'t change your mind now, after all that, alriiiight?"
"Didn\'t you think for an instant, ...that it might be alright to accept witches?
 You thought that, riiiiiight?
 Kukkikikikkakkakakakakakakakakaka!!"
"............I,
 ......I was...
...tr‐
...tricked......?
 That can\'t be.........
 You aren\'t that kind of—"
".............................."
"......Hi......hihhihahhahhahaaaHAAaHAHHH!!"
"Sorrrrry, Battleerrr, I am that kind of persooooooooooon!!
 Aah, it\'s no good, I can\'t keep this up, it looks like sentimental sob stories don\'t match well with meeeeeeeeeee!!
 Master, with all your strength, if you please!!
 That was such a plain role to play, and I got so bored!"
"I don\'t know who you are, woman!!
 But I\'ll beat you to death, mash you and crush you until threads start trailing, got iiiiiiiiiiiiiit?!
 I\'ll make you regret being born a womaaaaaaaaaaaan,
 hyahhaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahh!!"
Beato raised her gold pipe high,
 and the massive chandelier hanging in the hall crackled with electricity, and from that fell an almighty purple thunderbolt...!
It was a direct hit on the woman right below it, and should have turned her to ash.
However, ......not a single hair was singed.
"Hoh...!!
 I see you have what it takes to show up uninvited...!!
 Tell me! Say your name!!"
"I don\'t have any name to tell you.
 .........More importantly."
"......You idiot!!!
 How long are you going to be tricked?!!
 Stop being so naive and trusting!!
 Figure it out already!!
 All this, all of this is the witch\'s trap!!"
Those words were aimed at me.
......This is all...
...the witch\'s trap, she says...?
That can\'t be...
Beato reformed and swore to become a good witch......
".....................Beato...............
 ...Calling it a trap...
...is a lie, right......?
 Please.........tell me it\'s a lie......"
"......Sorry, Battleer.
 It was pretty interesting."
"...Still, I was just trying to do what Master told me, but it really did work very well!"
"I hear, after acting bad‐tempered and exploring the depths of cruelty, if you act properly incompetent and soft, you can get a massive rise on that goodwill meter thing, riiight?"
"I\'ve heard that villains who go soft and then crazy are pretty popular these daaaays...!
 Despite how I loook, I\'ve studied a lot of manga, anime, and galge that have been popular recently, you seeee?"
"And I tried it out, and just as expected, it was "tears please", and you\'re down!!"
"Hihhyahhahhahahahahahahahahahahahaha, idioooot, what a truly simple person!!
 They call this the "North Wind and the Sun Strategy".
 *cackle*cackle*cackle*!!"
"......How could............
 ............D‐
............damn you......
 You two‐faced bitch......
 How dare you deceive me like this...!!"
"...................................."
"......Yes, that expression fits you the most.
 That caring expression of yours really doesn\'t match me after all.
 My back was itching, and I was frantically trying to withstand it.
 *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!"
"Too baaad, wiiiitches...don\'t reforrrm☆"
"Hyaahhahhahhahhaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahh!!!
 You take care of the signature, Master!
 This uninvited guest is my prey!!"
"Come, you can no longer refuse to sign.
 ......Now, come on.
 Sign it and offer your body, your mind, and your soul...!!"
When VIRGILIA lifted her chin as a signal, the goat monsters, with an even more vise‐like power,
 forced my arm to approach the parchment......!
Owowowow... These guys are trying to make me sign, even if it breaks my arm......
At that moment, a bright red light burst open with me at the center, knocking the witches and the goat monsters away.
Did that woman save me......?!
B‐but who in the world is that? I don\'t have a clue!
"How long do you plan to keep playing in a place like this...?
 Enough already.
 I\'m jealous of you."
"............I, I\'m glad you saved me, but that\'s a pretty cruel way to say it.
 ...Sorry, but who are you...?"
".....................
 ...............Witch of Rokkenjima!!
 It\'s time you gave him back!!"
"Kuhhahahahahahahahah!!
 Who would do that, you fool!!
 Battler is my toy.
 My favorite toy, the best toy in the world...!!"
"I won\'t get tired of him, I won\'t throw him away, I won\'t hand him over to anyone!!
 Even Battler is enjoying this to the fullest.
 Together with me, he is having so much fun playing.
 No matter who you are, I won\'t let you interfere...!!"
"Oh yeah, it really does look like you\'re living it up here, I\'m so jealous my blood is boiling!!
 In a wonderful place like this, guffawing and having a lively, fun, noisy blast of a time with everyone!"
"Surrounded by lots of eye‐candy witches and being pampered all the time,
 I\'m sure you\'re having so much fun, you don\'t even want to come back!!"
"......A‐...are you talking to me...?
 Wait wait, you\'ve got the wrong idea...!
 This is a pain for me too!
 The hell is fun about this, you don\'t know a damn thing about my troubles...!"
"What troubles?!!!
 You get to have fun living with Mom and Dad, you get to play around happily with all of the cousins,
 you get to play with pleasant witches as long as you want for all eternity!"
"Don\'t you realize the happiness you have?!
 I\'m jealous of all of you, don\'t you get it?!
 I\'d love to be part of all this!!"
"*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!
 I\'m sorry, but no.
 I am satisfied with the toys I have.
 A rude toy like you is not fitting for my toy box!"
"Yes, I\'m aware of that.
 Who would ever play with someone like you?
 ......But I will thank you a bit.
 ......For bringing everyone together like this."
"......Who...
......are you...
 .....................You can\'t be—"
"......I see, so that\'s it...
 .........Yes, I get it, I know who you are!
 ...I see,
 so you are the piece Lady BERNKASTEL threw in.
 I like it!!"
"Why don\'t I formally invite you to my party?!!
 I\'ll welcome you fully...!!
 Along with Battler, I\'ll play with you nicely, break you, kill you, crush you, turn you to ash, mix you with bread dough and bake you until you\'re fluffy!!
 Fuhhahahahahahahahahahahaaaaaaaaaaahh!!"
".........Ohhhh, that\'s no good, no good at all!
 You\'ll never be able to do that!
 Rokkenjima, in the year 1986.
 ...I will expose everything that happened then to the light of day!"
"I\'ll teach you that you\'re no more than needle ice, scared of the spring of truth!
 Prepare yourself, Golden Witch!
 BEATRICE!!!"
