"......Erika‐chan, huh.
 She\'s an odd kid.
 ...Somehow, I just can\'t seem to get along well with the young kids these days."
"*giggle*.
 You\'re still pretty young yourself, George‐san."
"Hahaha...
 I guess it\'s because I\'ve always been the oldest of the cousins...
 It\'s always made me feel like I\'m not one of the young ones anymore."
George and Shannon could be seen surrounded by the rainy rose garden.
Though the rain was still pouring down, there was hardly any wind at all.
The scant protection provided by the arbor was more than enough to house this secret meeting between lovers.
Following that fight with Erika, the group had decided to play some cards for a change of pace.
When that was over, Shannon returned to the servant room,
 .....and shortly after that, George left the room as well to meet Shannon here at the time they had arranged.
"I think kids around Erika‐san\'s age have a really hard time accepting themselves."
"......Yeah, that\'s true.
 Around that age, most kids are so determined to break out of the shell of childhood that they lash out in all directions with their beaks.
 Only once they manage to break through can they finally stretch their wings and fly high.
 ......I was like that too.
 When I was still inside that shell, I was a weak, deplorable man who didn\'t deserve any respect."
"Th‐that\'s not true..."
"No, it\'s okay.
 I realize it myself.
 Back then, I might have been the oldest of the cousins, but I was still a lazy, hopeless man.
 ......And it wasn\'t just with the cousins.
 At home, at school—I was like that everywhere."
......I hated being like that.
I wanted to break that shell and become a splendid adult like Mother and Father.
"But in the end, ......you did break out of that shell, George‐sama.
 ......Every time I\'ve met you these past few years, you\'ve grown beyond recognition."
"Thank you."
"......Did something cause you to make up your mind?"
"To break out of my shell?"
"Yes.
 ......I can\'t imagine that you grew so rapidly, like a butterfly breaking out of its cocoon,
 by just wandering around aimlessly.
 ......I thought there must have been some turning point which made you become so determined."
"......I fell in love with you, and grew thanks to the power of love...is what I\'ve told you so far.
 Haha, ......but the truth is, the turning point was a much more negative emotion."
"No way......
 It\'s hard to believe that someone who\'s always as bright and cheerful as you could have negative emotions."
"Well,
 ......my parents taught me to treat girls well.
 And I thought that I had succeeded in living that way."
"Yes.
 I think you\'re a really wonderful gentleman..."
"But that was wrong."
".........?"
"I didn\'t know how to interact with the opposite sex.
 I deified them excessively......and though I always behaved in a gentlemanly, ladies first kind of way,
 I was probably outright afraid of interacting with girls."
Of course, George had wanted to be around girls as much as any boy might.
However, he didn\'t know how to interact with them.
 He wanted to act like a gentleman, avoid being disliked by them, and treat them with care.
Of those feelings, only the words "treat girls well" took precedence,
 blossoming into a subconscious fear of women...
"You might call a man like that "gentlemanly" or "a late bloomer".
 .........Ridiculous.
 I was just a coward.
 Because of that, I started to wonder why I couldn\'t get a lover if I was so gentlemanly,
 and I eventually came to the conclusion that all the women in the world had no taste, and started to hate all of them...stupidly.
 .........That\'s what a truly pathetic man looks like."
How many years ago was it when I noticed?
 It started when I was in middle school.
At the time, I assumed that I was obviously the most gentlemanly of the cousins, so I would obviously be popular with women.
However, reality was completely different.
At school, I was pretty much completely hopeless.
......Far from being a leader, I was the bullied kid who got pushed around by everyone.
At the time, I figured I was just a capable and adaptable man, who could keep in perfect tune with his surroundings.
 ......How stupid.
Sure, I might have gained some measure of trust from girls.
......However, not only was there no one who would become my girlfriend, I didn\'t even know any girls I could call a friend.
"Of course.
 ......I was a man who always took a step back from girls, under the pretense of ladies first.
 Who would ever want to stand behind such a negative, unmotivated man?
 ...It\'s funny.
 I didn\'t even realize this, and thought I was a pretty attractive guy."
".........I can sort of understand how you felt.
 ...Just because someone puts in a lot of hard work to look attractive to the opposite sex,
 it doesn\'t mean it will necessarily work out as they planned."
"Oh?
 ......Has that happened to you too, Shannon?"
"Of course.
 ......One time, I wanted to catch a boy\'s eye so much, I tried to put on makeup even though I didn\'t know how and embarrassed myself...
 ......Eheheh, I remember a lot of embarrassing failures."
"The person that made me finally get over my conceit and open my eyes......was you, Shannon.
 ......No, it was all of you."
".........What was the turning point for you, George‐san?"
"Haha,
 ......envy, probably."
"That\'s unexpected.
 ......But envy for what?"
"I saw you and Battler‐kun having a really good time talking.
 ......That made me envious."
"............Me and...Battler‐sama?"
Shannon raced through her memories, trying to find a conversation that might have made George envious.
"Haha, it probably seemed trivial to you two.
 However, it still made me envious.
 ......I don\'t want Battler‐kun to hear what I say next, no matter what.
 Can you promise me?"
"O‐of course..."
".....................
 ......It\'s going to be a shameful confession.
 ...Still, I want you to hear it.
 I want to hear your answer tonight...only after I\'ve told you about my bad sides as well."
"............Okay.
 ......Let me hear it."
With a smile but a serious look in her eyes, Shannon nodded.
Tonight.
 ......She knew what he was going to ask her tonight.
George had the right to confess before asking that sacred question, and Shannon had the obligation to listen.
Shannon understood this, ......so she listened quietly.
"So this is what a Witch of Theatergoing peeps in on during her spare time?"
"......Stories of love are truly timeless.
 I never tire of them.
 ......However, I do find that maidenly expression of disgust on your face even more charming..."
{f:5:Featherine} laughed quietly.
Ange huffed and looked away,
 but she quickly realized that this would only entertain {f:5:Featherine} even more, so she tried to act unconcerned...
"Both Battler‐kun and Jessica‐chan have always been spirited.
 ......No, phrasing it that way is just dodging the point.
 ......Let me be frank."
George looked up at where the moon should be, high above the rain clouds...and spoke.
They were honest words, spoken from George\'s meek heart...
"......For a long time back then,
 I thought of Battler‐kun and Jessica‐chan...
as bad‐mannered kids.
 ......No, let me be more direct.
 ......I thought that even the way they talked was vulgar.
 .........It\'s true.
 I don\'t mind if you hold me in contempt for that."
"I don\'t.
 ......People are allowed to think anything they want inside their hearts.
 In fact, I think you were all the more commendable for not letting it show on the outside."
"Thanks.
 .........I secretly looked down on those two.
 I was so conceited that I truly thought I was just overflowing with gentlemanly charm compared to them."
I was at that age where having a girlfriend felt like a necessary condition for becoming a real man.
I truly believed that no girl could fail to admire a gentleman who treated girls as well as I did.
So, I really did assume that the girls I knew were attracted to me.
"I thought that Battler‐kun and Jessica‐chan, who always joked around and spoke in a rude, vulgar fashion,
 would never be able to get a boyfriend or girlfriend.
 ......I might have used that argument to distract myself when I still couldn\'t get a girlfriend."
"......I was a fool.
 They weren\'t inferior to me at all.
 I was the inferior one, with my deification of the opposite sex and my fear, which I hid under the guise of "ladies first"."
"That\'s been Battler\'s and Jessica\'s personality from the beginning.
 True, they were rude, and one couldn\'t have called them gentlemanly or ladylike.
 ......However, they did have the power to interact without worrying about their sexes.
 ...In fact, you might even call that their charm."
".........I sort of understand.
 People like Onii‐chan and Jessica onee‐chan can get along with anyone whether that person\'s a boy or a girl.
 ......Apologies to George onii-chan, but...guys who try too hard to act like a "gentleman"...I find them a bit creepy.
 ......It\'s like they have delusions about women or something..."
"People respect it when someone they are distant from is boring and harmless.
 However, they only like that person because he or she doesn\'t get in their way.
 ......No human being would want to deepen their connection with a boring person."
"......Of course.
 No idiot would want to be friends with an unmoving, unspeaking telephone pole.
 ......However, unmoving and unspeaking is exactly what you\'d want from a telephone pole."
"That\'s it.
 It seems as though George finally discovered that he wouldn\'t be viewed as an attractive man no matter how superior he was,
 and that he had been treated like a telephone pole the whole time..."
"Back then, my conceit was at its peak.
 ......So, when everyone gathered at the family conferences,
 I believed that I was the most attractive, and that all the servant girls who played with us were in love with me.
 .........And then the day came when I finally realized how pathetic I was."
".........Did I...say something inconsiderate then......?"
"No, it\'s the opposite.
 .........You didn\'t say anything at all.
 My conceited delusion that I was the only one ever reflected in your eyes...was crushed."
Just when did it start?
......No, it must have started long before then.
I only failed to notice because my eyes were clouded with conceit.
"......One day, I suddenly realized it.
 ......You guys were getting along with Battler‐kun and Jessica‐chan far better than with me,
 ......playing around and having a good time."
......Yes.
 Those two, whom I had looked down upon so much, were radiating far more charm than I was.
You really looked like you were enjoying yourself that day.
The look on your face was far brighter than any you ever showed me.
"Hahaha, sickening, isn\'t it?
 ......I just assumed that you liked me,
 and even had some childish fantasy that we might end up dating."
"Based on nothing at all, I felt as though my girlfriend had been stolen from me and let myself feel hurt.
 .........Just how pathetic was I at that moment...
 ......When that happened, I finally realized how foolish I had been."
".........George‐sama......"
"After that, stuff happened and Battler‐kun stopped coming to the family conferences, but I heard about him from time to time from Uncle Rudolf.
 ......Uncle Rudolf cares more than he shows.
 Even though he gets in fights with Battler‐kun all the time, ...he\'s always paid close attention to his son\'s goings‐on."
"......Yes.
 I\'ve heard similar things.
 ......Even Asumu‐sama despaired at how alike they were.
 ......She was sure that Rudolf‐sama\'s blood was to blame for all the trouble caused by Battler‐sama\'s popularity with the girls at school."
"And Jessica‐chan too.
 I\'d heard that she\'d built up a huge number of friends, both boys and girls, and that she was always the center of attention.
 ......When I actually talked with her, I realized that this was no exaggeration."
That experience had......shown that the two I had looked down upon...
...were much more attractive human beings than I was...
"At first, I tried to imitate those two.
 ......It was pretty ridiculous.
 I thought that by joking around and speaking rudely, I could get that same charm they had."
"*giggle*.
 ......You did that?
 It\'s a bit hard to picture."
"It was pathetic...
 I wish I could forget that time for the rest of my life.
 In any event, I quickly realized that I would never gain any true charm by imitating them like that."
......I called it "respecting people",
 I called it "acting to fit in with the general atmosphere",
 .........but actually I was always just running away, and this cowardice was the reason for my lack of charm.
I resolved myself to overcome that flaw and be reborn.
......I finally understood the shell I was in, and I swore to break out of it.
Every time my resilience began to waver, ......I would remember that day.
 ......That day I saw you all forget about me entirely and play around happily.
 And the fact that those eyes of yours, which I always assumed were attracted to me, never noticed me at all.
.........I made an oath.
 This time, I would really make you take notice of me, and I would be reflected in your eyes.
 ......The truth is...that was the very first emotion, the start of me falling in love with you.
"...............It must have been...complicated."
"That day, I felt a desire for revenge against you all—no, against you specifically—for playing as a group and ignoring me.
 And before I knew it, that emotion had transformed into true love."
"......However, I swear this to God.
 Even though that was the reason I first started to take you seriously,
 ......there are no lies in the way I feel about you now."
"......I swear to love you for all my life.
 I will not lie about that for anyone or anything.
 And I am prepared to take you as my wife, even if it means having the entire world as my enemy."
"......George...san......"
"That is the confession I wanted to make to you beforehand.
 ......Before now, I\'ve called you my first love, love at first sight.
 ......That was a lie.
 ...It was only my selfish, twisted—"
"That doesn\'t matter."
Shannon smiled,
 ......but she spoke forcefully enough to interrupt George\'s words.
"Is there some rule saying that people can\'t get together just because they weren\'t each other\'s first love...?
 Is it betrayal to forget the first person you fell in love with...?
 Love......isn\'t that simple.
 Well, ......it might be simple.
 ......After all, love is easy.
 ......Always, whatever you feel now...
...only the honest feelings you feel now can tell you the right answer.
 So, things of the past or how our relationship started aren\'t important at all."
"......Then, ...I confessed for nothing...?"
"*giggle*, no.
 ......I\'m a bit glad to learn that even George‐san, who\'s always perfect at everything, has a human side to him.
 ......And it makes me happy to know that I\'m the only person you\'ve told this to."
".........Thank you.
 ...I was only able to become who I am because of you."
"Me too.
 I am as I am because of you, George‐san.
 ......So please, tell me without holding back.
 ......What kind of husband and wife will we be,
 ......and what kind of future will we build together?"
"When I have you as my wife,
 I will become an even more accomplished businessman than my father.
 ......And through all kinds of challenges and adventures, I hope to explore the limits of my potential.
 I want to reach that peak together with you.
 ......The view from there will be something no one can show you but me."
"It sounds fun.
 ......I\'ll be with you wherever you go."
"Of course, it won\'t only be an adventure as a businessman.
 ...I\'d like to create many things that only a couple can make."
"*giggle*.
 ......And what could that be?"
"Let\'s have some kids."
"*giggle*.
 .........Yes, my husband."
"I\'d like three of them at the least.
 At least one boy and one girl."
"And what if all three are boys...?"
"Then the next one might be a girl.
 We can make a fourth one.
 ......It doesn\'t matter how many.
 Let\'s enjoy the adventure of bringing them up together.
 And when those children eventually leave their nest, they\'ll make us some grandchildren.
 Before we know it, we\'ll reach a boisterous old age surrounded by many children and grandchildren."
"It sounds like fun.
 I wonder......what kind of a grandpa you\'ll be."
"And I wonder what kind of a grandma you\'ll be.
 However, I will always keep loving you.
 ......And when we eventually pass away, surrounded by our vast family, our lives will stretch behind us, unmatched by anyone else\'s."
George didn\'t just talk about his love in the present.
He swore to love her soul until the final moment...
when the lids of their coffins would be shut.
Then, George took a small box out of his pocket.
......Even without opening it, she knew what was inside.
He took it out with a motion that was more natural even than the one he had practiced in the bathroom at the airport,
 and it was overflowing with charm.
"Sayo."
"Yes."
"Let\'s get married."
"Yes."
"Please, take this ring and put it on your finger."
".........Yes, George‐san."
That ring, which glistened divinely even in the dim light of the arbor,
 ......passed from George\'s hand to Shannon\'s finger.
Of course, Shannon had already decided which finger to put it on.
"I swear to resolutely stand against any fate which may attempt to get in the way of our future."
George proclaimed that he would reveal their engagement to the entire family on the next day.
"My parents might criticize this marriage.
 ......However, I will not let them stop us.
 I am going to inform them of our engagement, not ask for their permission.
 If Mother says that she will not allow our marriage,
 I plan to have myself disinherited, and we will leave this family together."
"I have been prepared for that since long ago.
 ......I swear once again to resolutely stand against all fates that get in the way of our future."
......George had said it aloud.
So, Shannon said the same thing.
"Me too.
 ......I swear to stand against all fates that get in the way of our future."
"*giggle*giggle*.
 ......Battler‐saaan, when will the crimes start?
 I\'ve just about had enough of this love show."
".....................
 ......Be quiet and watch."
"......Sure, fine.
 I\'d hate to yawn and let some spectacular bit of foreshadowing slip by."
"............Do you have no love?"
"Are there any mysteries which accept love as proof?
 No, there aren\'t."
Erika laughed coldly and stared down at the two on the game board.
Battler watched her quietly.
......Erika thought she felt a touch of pity in his gaze, and she averted her eyes uncomfortably.
"........................
 ...I do understand, more or less.
 Love can at least become a motive for murder.
 ......I can interpret this scene beneath the arbor to represent a possible motive for the crime if their engagement is somehow impeded."
".........Then again, no matter how much people talk of love with words that aren\'t red, it\'s all just an illusion.
 *cackle*cackle*cackle*!"
".........That\'s very sad.
 ......You can\'t even love anyone without proof given to you by a witch."
"Please put an end to this frivolous romance talk.
 I am your enemy, not some eccentric friend of yours content to engage with your ramblings about love."
"..........................."
"I can\'t understand you at all anymore.
 ......What on Earth did you figure out?
 Weren\'t you and Beato always insulting and trying to kill each other?"
"......What kind of truth could you have reached to make you change your emotions regarding her?
 ......Please don\'t tell me that feelings of true love have sprouted from your murderous rivalry or something ridiculous like that."
"......Lady {f:5:Erika}.
 Let us have him continue the game\'s {f:5:progression}.
 Boring love scenes such as this are best finished {f:5:quickly}."
"Ah, you\'ve got a point there.
 Sorry for butting in.
 Come on, let\'s move on."
".............................."
"......It\'s Shannon.
 I\'ve come back."
"Mm.
 ......The log for today hasn\'t been filled out yet."
"Yes.
 I\'ll do that right away.
 ......Kanon‐kun, thanks for keeping an eye out while I was gone."
"........................
 ......That was a pretty long break."
Kanon had already noticed.
 ......There was a silvery glint coming from the ring finger on Shannon\'s left hand.
"Then I will retire.
 ......Please do not hesitate to wake me if anything occurs."
""Goodnight, Genji‐sama.""
Genji disappeared off to the waiting room.
......After that, only Shannon and Kanon remained.
"......Thanks for giving me some time.
 I\'ll be staying here, so you can take a break now if you want."
"..............................
 ......In other words, it\'s my turn now."
".........Yeah.
 ......Sorry, ......but we aren\'t going to lose."
"And I......won\'t lose either......"
"Even though you\'ve always been a coward and let Milady take the lead until now...?"
"............Wasn\'t it you who taught me, Nee‐san?"
"What did I teach you...?"
"The past is immaterial when it comes to love.
 The present is all that\'s important.
 If that is true, then I think my present is in no way inferior to yours, Nee‐san."
Shannon and Kanon glared at each other with serious eyes.
That period of tension vanished when Shannon chuckled.
"......Yeah, that\'s good.
 ......You and Milady have to give it your all.
 ......If you do end up together,
 ......make sure you build up a relationship wonderful enough that we can cheer you on with all our hearts."
"Well, you do have a huge lead on me."
"......Nothing to be done about that.
 That\'s what you get for your cowardice before now."
"I know.
 ......That is my...sin."
Shannon and Kanon fished around in their pockets, ......and drew out two small things that glittered gold.
They looked like......the left and right wings of a gold butterfly.
"We are furniture.
 ......In order to become {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} and receive the miracle that allows us to love, ......we must rely on a miracle of magic once again."
"......To think that her brooch would prove useful."
"It\'s the only magic within our reach."
It was the golden butterfly brooch,
 which {f:5:Beatrice} had once given to Shannon in the hopes of creating love between her and George.
Shannon had given it to Kanon, but he had let his emotions get ahold of him and had crushed it into pieces.
So, when the two wings they held were brought together, ......it would regain the form of a beautiful butterfly.
"......Then I\'ll be back soon.
 ......After all, they have asked me to play cards with them."
"Yeah.
 Good luck.
 ......I\'m sure Milady will be happy."
"......It\'s a bit embarrassing."
"Enjoy it.
 That feeling."
Kanon left the servant room.
 ......He went to go see Jessica and tell her what he had determined to do.
Shannon quietly watched him go.
The fragment of the brooch and the engagement ring let off a gold and silver glint......
"That takes me back.
 That\'s something I gave Shannon, if I recall.
 ......I always wondered where that disappeared to after Kanon stepped on it, but it seems they still had it all the time."
"......That\'s the golden butterfly brooch, isn\'t it?
 ......I read about the magical brooch that can save a love relationship in {f:5:Featherine}‐san\'s book."
And that had been the first moment that {f:5:Beatrice}, witch of the forest,
 had met with a human and given them her power.
Bit by bit, she had ascended from a mere ghost to the ruler of the mansion at night,
 ......and by making the servants believe in her, she had wiped away the anti‐magic power.
And then, ......it eventually became possible for her to appear openly in front of Shannon,
 whose magic resistance had grown particularly low and who had begun to believe in the existence of {f:5:Beatrice}...
To Beato, who had been unable to interact with anyone for many years, this conversation with Shannon must have been especially fun...
"That\'s why I generously gave her the butterfly brooch.
 ......*cackle*cackle*, I was in quite a good mood.
 ...It is no common thing for a heartless witch such as myself to be so gracious."
"But it\'s wonderful.
 You brought a pair of future lovers together."
"Of course, I did not do it to pamper them.
 ......It was in exchange for smashing that hateful spirit mirror that had repressed my magical powers.
 Thanks to that, I was able to regain much of my power all in one go."
"But then, one night, purple lightning smashed the shrine.
 Those of the surrounding islands called it an evil omen.
 Oooh, now that I think of it, that must have been a prelude to {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama\'s resurrection."
Kumasawa had the rest of the night off.
So, she had let Erika talk her into drinking a bit,
 and was chatting about the legend of Akujikijima and {f:5:Beatrice} in a happy, tipsy mood.
Erika would nod from time to time, but she listened very closely.
She wasn\'t actually taking notes, but she was gathering the information on the whiteboard inside her head.
......Then, she frowned as though noticing something out of place and held up her hand.
"Wait a second."
"Yes?"
"......That shrine was built by a traveling mountaineering ascetic to seal up the evil spirits of Akujikijima.
 Isn\'t that right?"
"Yes, that is correct.
 It was one who possessed a vast supernatural power, and who placed that power within the mirror—"
"And placed it within the shrine as a sacred mirror to seal the evil spirits.
 ......Something feels off about that.
 ......Why would a shrine to seal the evil spirits of Akujikijima also seal {f:5:Beatrice}?"
"W‐......well...
 That\'s, uh, because the power of the sacred mirror..."
"......I see.
 So it\'s this really convenient sacred mirror that works on both evil spirits from the East and witches from the West.
 ......Got it.
 I\'m still not satisfied, but I\'ll back off there for now.
 What I don\'t understand is why {f:5:Beatrice} can\'t stand spiderwebs."
According to the legend, the evil spirits of Akujikijima despised spiderwebs,
 so they were apparently used as wards against evil on the islands around here.
Actually, spiders are a useful bug.
The farmers of the islands may well have treasured them.
It\'s very possible that the farmers called them wards against evil, tying them to the stories about evil spirits,
 in order to create a tradition of people treating this useful bug with care through the generations...
"But that\'s just the legend of Akujikijima.
 The origins for the legend of the witch {f:5:Beatrice} came after Ushiromiya Kinzo moved to this island,
 when rumors sprouted about the mysterious legend of the gold and his mistress who gave it to him as a witch."
"In other words, the evil spirits of Akujikijima and the Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice} are completely different things.
 And yet, the same things are said about them."
"W‐......well now......"
The evil spirits of Akujikijima couldn\'t stand spiderwebs.
 So neither could {f:5:Beatrice}.
That sort of reasoning has been applied all over the place.
......When it was pointed out that this was strange, Kumasawa was lost for an answer...
"The doorknob to Kinzo‐san\'s study has a scorpion magic circle drawn on it, which represents a charm against magic in Western sorcery.
 That\'s why the Western witch {f:5:Beatrice} can\'t touch it.
 ......I can understand that part."
"But there\'s no reason for {f:5:Beatrice} to dislike spiderwebs.
 I don\'t remember spiderwebs ever being included among things Western witches can\'t stand.
 On the contrary, wouldn\'t spiders be the friends and minions of a witch?"
"W‐......well......"
"In my opinion,
 ......these two legends about the evil spirits of Akujikijima and the witch {f:5:Beatrice}...
have become a little mixed together.
 In fact, maybe they\'ve been fully joined together as one."
"......The legend of Akujikijima is a fairy tale created by fishermen fearful of reefs in the Rokkenjima area.
 However, there was no visual image to go along with those evil spirits.
 Were they people, or monsters, or ghosts without legs?
 There\'s no mental picture of them.
 People are bad at imagining things without visuals.
 ......And then the legend of the witch called {f:5:Beatrice} came in."
"A witch is a lot easier to picture than evil spirits.
 And on top of that, Kinzo‐san had a portrait of {f:5:Beatrice} drawn and displayed.
 In other words, the lack of a visual image, which was the one weak point in the legend of Akujikijima, was finally completed.
 Perhaps the two legends became mixed together at some point after that."
"W‐well, I wonder......
 ...H‐......hohoho...
 It is a bit confusing for an old lady such as myself..."
Kumasawa laughed to smooth it over, wiping away a cold sweat...
She might have seemed confused, but she actually did understand what Erika was saying.
......In truth, she did have a rough understanding of how the legend of Akujikijima, which had been around before Ushiromiya Kinzo had come to Rokkenjima,
 and the legend of the Golden Witch, the story of the woman who had given Kinzo a vast quantity of gold,
 ......had changed over time.
She didn\'t want to admit it, ......but she knew.
{f:5:Beatrice}\'s "backstory", that she hated the spirit mirror and spiderwebs...
...had actually been based on the ancient legend of Akujikijima.
The "evil spirits" part of that legend had just been replaced by the witch of the portrait......
"......So,
 if there really was someone claiming to be the Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice},
 I\'d really like to ask her...
whether she actually does hate spiderwebs or not.
 ......What happens when she touches them?"
"I‐it is said that witches and their minions...
......receive burns when they touch spiderwebs...
...so that is probably what would happen, I would say..."
"Hmph, that\'s not bad.
 A splendid witch trial.
 ......If the spiderweb touches her and she gets burned,
 then she\'s an evil spirit, not a witch.
 ......And if nothing happens, then it proves she\'s just a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}."
"In other words, .........whether she\'s burned or not,
 it will prove that the Golden Witch doesn\'t exist.
 ......The legend of the witch is nothing more than the legend of Akujikijima re‐boiled with a new face on it."
".........W‐.........well........."
"All it takes is the presence of a legend, and a deduction like this becomes trivial for Furudo Erika.
 Your thoughts, ladies and gentlemen......?"
Though only the two of them were in the lounge,
 Erika faced in the direction an invisible audience would have been if there was one,
 and shrugged...
And, to match Erika\'s imagination,
 .........the two of them actually were there, listening in...
".........Spiderwebs...?
 They burn if you touch them......?"
"..........................."
When Beato the Elder snapped her fingers,
 ......a graceful silver spider slipped down from the ceiling, hanging by a transparent thread.
Afterwards, only a single silver strand remained.
"..................Umm........."
Timidly,
 ......Beato stretched her finger out towards the spider\'s string...
And she............touched it......
".....................
 ......I\'m fine."
".........You are?"
"Huh......?"
Beato the Elder lifted up a white, pale finger, and after showing it to her little sister,
 ......she traced the silver string with it.
...There was a stench like a single hair being burnt.
Once again, she held her finger up in front of Beato, who was dumbfounded.
There was a thin burn line, as though someone had traced across it with a razor......
"What......does this mean...?"
"That\'s what I would like to know.
 Why are you unharmed?"
"I, I don\'t know.
 ......What I don\'t understand is why you do get burnt by touching a spiderweb..."
"......I do not know.
 It has always been like that since I first gained consciousness."
"Then, .........are you........."
Beato hesitated.
......However, her question was clear.
"No.
 I am not one of the evil spirits of Akujikijima.
 I am {f:5:Beatrice}, ruler of Rokkenjima\'s night.
 ......Even I do not know why I have the same weakness as this island\'s evil spirits of old..."
"Are spiderwebs the only things you can\'t handle...?"
"As this Erika said, I can\'t touch the doorknob to Kinzo\'s study.
 That scorpion magic circle burns me.
 ......For me, trying to open the door to that study is like trying to pick a red‐hot horseshoe out of a fire.
 .........What about you?"
"Huh?
 Scorpion magic circles, you mean......?"
The older sister snapped her fingers again.
When she did, the surrounding scene bent and twisted, and they had suddenly moved to the place in front of Kinzo\'s study.
And there......was the doorknob engraved with the scorpion magic circle.
"Those who research sorcery must have a refuge sealed off from both human and spiritual disturbances.
 ......It is no surprise that Kinzo chose to seal off his study and place a charm such as this here.
 ......And, unfortunately, that affects me as well, as I will show you..."
She gently grasped the doorknob.
As she did, a violent burning sound, unbelievably stronger than the one caused by the spiderweb, rang out.
"O‐Onee‐sama, are you okay...?!
 Your hand......aaaaaaahhh...!!"
Her hand......had been horribly burnt, and Beato couldn\'t help but avert her eyes...
"Fear not.
 This scratch will heal quickly."
Apparently, it would heal by itself if left alone.
......The older sister seemed to heal at an inhuman rate.
"However,
 ......it seems that you can handle it just fine."
"..................G‐
......go."
She timidly poked the doorknob.
 ......Nothing happened.
Slowly, ......she touched it with her entire palm, but she felt nothing but a pleasantly cool sensation.
"......Strange.
 ......Though you are my double, you are different from me in several ways."
"While I might be able to touch the doorknob,
 ......if I ever get burnt like you did, I don\'t think I would heal that easily..."
".........It\'s as though you\'re a normal {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}."
"Y‐yes.
 ......Even I find it a little hard to believe that I\'m a witch...
 ......I can\'t use magic like you, and I can\'t get strange burns or heal from them later..."
".........Father believed...
...that I was a great witch reborn...
...but...
...I cannot believe that......"
"......Who are you?"
"I, I am {f:5:Beatrice}.
 ......I was born for Father\'s sake.
 ......And you, Onee‐sama?"
"I am also {f:5:Beatrice}.
 I used magic to give Kinzo gold, and later became a soul and the formless witch that haunts this island."
"..................Just who on Earth...
...are we......?"
"......Unlike me, it seems that you possess a body."
"Huh?
 Really......?"
"Yes.
 ......It occurred to me while listening to that Erika person.
 ......I am a witch who can use magic but has no body,
 ......and you are a witch who has a body but can use no magic.
 .........Eventually, perhaps we will become one, each filling in what the other lacks, and become the true, complete {f:5:Beatrice}."
"................................."
It did seem plausible.
Both of the {f:5:Beatrice}s were missing something.
If they were to become one, then surely they would be very close to the {f:5:Beatrice} that Battler desired...
"......Do you want...to try?"
"............Huh...?"
"Hold out your hand."
The older sister slowly raised her palm and held it out before Beato.
The large burn from a second ago really had started to heal already...
"It may be possible for us to become one.
 I want to know as well.
 By becoming one with you, ......I want to learn about my future self."
".............................."
Beato also raised her hand slowly,
 .........and the two hands...
...touched......
..............................
......But nothing happened.
Perhaps this meant that, while they were fated to become one eventually, that time had not yet come......
"......For me, being burned by spiderwebs is perfectly normal.
 However, you didn\'t even know about it.
 ......In the same way, you say that the reason you were born was for your father\'s sake.
 ......Apparently, that father is Ushiromiya Battler."
"I know him as a rare guest who only comes a few times a year,
 but I cannot understand what connection you and I have with such an infrequent guest.
 ......Surely, we must learn more about each other."
"Y‐yeah, you\'re right...
 ......I get the feeling that learning about each other......will lead us to something very important."
"On the other side lies the single future {f:5:Beatrice}.
 ......No, it may be more correct to say that it is the true form we are supposed to possess."
With their hands still joined, the two {f:5:Beatrice}s swore to fill in the parts the other lacked...
and regain their single form.
......Bit by bit, .........Beato was walking down the path that led to the former {f:5:Beatrice}...
