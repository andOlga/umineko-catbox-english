Tradition demands that the kitchens of demons must have a cauldron.

One larger than the average household bath.

...Of course, since it\'s meant for stewing human meat.

Is that a deadly dish in the making?..
Or is it torture via degustation?..

A bowl floated upon the hot water that filled the cauldron, a variety of minced, tasty-looking chocolates within...

A spotlight illuminated the scene, and Ronove entered the stage, wearing a chef\'s hat.

"Now then, ladies in front of the television, how is this?
Once the chocolate is heated and melted throughout, pour it into the bowl of cold water we\'ve prepared beforehand.
Then stir, stir, stir."

"But be careful, or the edges will solidify.
Let us stir so as not to let those men\'s molten hearts cool down."

...The host of this year\'s Valentine\'s Day chocolate special seemed to be truly enjoying himself.

"Since the tempering is complete,
let us continue by squeezing the chocolate into bite-size circles.
Look, isn\'t that just perfect? It is like a chocolate cookie, if I do say so myself."

With a practiced movement, Ronove punctuated his words with the creation of a succession of chocolate medals.

"Next, ladies, please show me your originality by decorating it to your own taste.
I shall merely suggest nuts as a basis.
Almond, pistachio, cashews...
walnuts and tea leaves are wonderful as well."

"The demons\' special recipe calls for it to be decorated with the seed of a datura and a flower of a brugmansia.
When he eats it, perhaps you\'ll mysteriously find out the name of the girl he likes?"

"The Valentine\'s Day is the celebration of maidens\' dreams!..
I, Ronove, sincerely wish that you shall remember this wonderful and precious day for a lifetime.
Pukkukkukku!"

(Ryukishi\'s note: seeds of datura and flowers of brugmansia are poisonous for humans! Don\'t eat them!)

"Of course, of course.
Because humans will be eating the chocolate this time, let us not use any poisonous plants.
Once you cool this in the refrigerator, it is complete.
Now please, ladies and gentlemen, a round of applause, pukkukku!"

The kitchen fairies clapped and cheered in admiration of Ronove.
He returned their praise with a graceful bow, and with that, the Valentine\'s Day chocolate special came to its conclusion.

Ronove placed the chocolate in a beautifully decorated box,
suitable for presentation to his mistress, BEATRICE.

"It would be best if Milady were to handcraft her own Valentine\'s chocolate,
but there are also times when this shoddy chocolate of mine can grab hold of a gentleman\'s heart."

Apart from Beato\'s share, there was still plenty of chocolate left.

Ronove brought his hands together, and the sound of his clapping echoed throughout the kitchen.

"You may come out now.
Thank you kindly for keeping yourselves invisible while I was cooking.
As a token of my appreciation, why don\'t I share this with all of you?"

"Kyahahaha!
Oh, sir Ronove, you\'re too kind!~"

Beelzebub was the first to appear,
with a *bang* from behind the cauldron.

Once one of them appears, it\'s no use for the other sisters to stay hidden.

From the refrigerator, from the pots, and from many other similar places, hands and feet began to emerge, followed by the remaining six sisters themselves.

"W-we apologize, sir Ronove...
We didn\'t mean to spy on you..."

"Think nothing of it.
After all, the seven of you are maidens.
It is only proper that your hearts should beat swiftly on Valentine\'s Day!
Of course it would be a matter of interest to all of you."

"Sir Ronoveeeee, can I eat this?
I\'m hungry, I\'m hungry!"

"Geez, can\'t you act like an adult a little, Beelz?!
Don\'t count your chickens before they hatch!"

Satan scolded the excited Beelzebub.
The Seven Sisters of Purgatory were as lively as usual today.

"Not so hasty, everyone.
I said that I would share this chocolate with you, but I did not say a word about allowing you to eat it."

"E, eeeeeeeeeeeeeh?!..
B-but...
Chocolate we can\'t eat, that\'s too much, it\'s torture!"

"...When the need arises to punish Beelzebub, let us use this method from now on.

...Do not be disappointed, everyone.
This is Valentine\'s Day chocolate, is it not?
That wonderful day when a woman gives chocolate to a man."

"I, I see.
...So, we should hand this chocolate over to a man?"

"You are mistaken, Lucifer.
It is not \'handing over\'.
It is giving a present to the man who is the dearest in each of your hearts.

Is it not the long-awaited Valentine\'s Day?
This world is but a twisted place in which you exist to kill or be killed!"

"Is this not a precious behind-the-scenes interlude?
Please, allow yourselves to enjoy the bittersweet feelings of a young maiden\'s heart.
This is the gift that I wish to share with you."

""""""*chatter, chatter*!""""""
The seven sisters were surprised by this unexpected development.

So instead of gouging men with their stakes, it\'s better to give them chocolate?..

"Kya~~, awesoooome!
Thank you so much, Sir Ronove!~

I wonder who I\'ll give my chocolate to?!~"

Since the affairs of love and lust are Asmodeus\' number one interest,
her cheeks flushed red, and she continued to shout "kya, kya".

"My, my.
It seems Asmo is the most enthusiastic.
Let us congratulate her.

Now, all of you, one by one.
If there\'s no man who interests you, women are just fine too.
Anyway, definitely give it to somebody.
Or else..."

"...Or else?.."

Lucifer asked fearfully...
But Ronove did not answer, he merely grinned.

On occasions like this, Ronove can be quite terrifying.

If you complain too much, you might get scolded.
When he smiles, you had better play along.

And so, the Seven Sisters\' Valentine\'s Day became somewhat of a duty...

"...Well, you heard what he said.
I trust each member of the Stakes shall carry out their duty splendidly.
Now, let us be off!"

""""""Ye~s, Big Sis!""""""

When Lucifer ordered the deployment, the seven sisters popped out all at once and dashed out of the kitchen as if flying,
the pots and pans clattering behind them.

Now then, to whom did the Seven Sisters of Purgatory give their chocolate to?..

It is quite an ordinary thing for them to gouge with a stake; this dangerous task is their exclusive specialty.
Gifting chocolate, on the other hand, was something they had absolutely no experience with.

Even if they are ordered to give it to somebody, it isn\'t that simple to do.

However, it seems that Asmo, whose head was usually full of romantic thoughts anyway, has already made her decision long ago.

"Eh, wha, you, you have decided whom you\'re going to give it?!
Tell us, tell us!"

"Ufufufufu~
Of course I have!
The prince on the white horse who appeared in EP4!
Amakusa Juuza, for sure!"

"...Aah, Amakusa.
Haa... I get it, so that\'s who you had in mind..."

"You must be kidding me, sisters!
Of course I checked out all the new male characters!~

But isn\'t Juuza just wonderful?~
He\'s stoic and a little wild, but not coarse, and he\'s got a great bod too...
Aah, he\'s definitely my type!~"

As soon as she said that, Asmo transmogrified into a stake and flew off.

Giving chocolate in that kind of mood seemed worrisome, so the other sisters followed her.

They flew away with a loud clatter.
"Mr. Amakusa!
This is Valentine\'s Day chocolate!
Please, accept it!"

...A standard strategy... no, it was totally a frontal attack.

"T-that courage...
Isn\'t she the least bit flustered?!"

"I heard that men fall to the first taker...
I suppose the hiding behind a tree strategy isn\'t popular nowadays..."

"Shouldn\'t she be a little more self-conscious?!
Ah, jeez, she was totally upfront about it!
She\'s such a kid!"

The elder sisters quietly muttered from the shadows.

Amakusa was not embarrassed, and took the chocolate with a smile.

...The gesture gave off an impression that he\'s quite used to this sort of thing, but it was suave rather than suspicious from a woman\'s perspective.

"<Thanks>, <cute> young lady.
Did you make this yourself?"

"Yes, of course! I made it just for you, Amakusa~!"

"W-what a shameless liar!.."

"It\'s impossible for Amakusa to tell whether she really made it by hand!

It\'s a Devil\'s Proof!"

"But Asmo looks like she\'s done this before...

She must\'ve practiced until it\'s second nature to her."

"What the hell are we doing?!

Have we been outdone by our youngest sister?!
Aren\'t you all ashamed?!"

As expected of Asmodeus of Lust.

She got a perfect clear by using a shortcut.

Happily sitting side by side with him and unwrapping the packaging, she treated Amakusa to Ronove\'s specially made chocolate.

"Here, Amakusa!
Noooommmm!~"

"N-nom."

In but an instant, she had constructed a world of intimate mutual love.
Truly frightening, Asmodeus of Lust!

"S, she\'s really something...
This is the first time Asmo\'s made me shiver like that..."

"Mmm~, that really looks tasty.
Whyyy do I have to give it away?
I wanna eat it myself!"

As usual, Beelzebub of Gluttony grumbled about having to give the chocolate away.

However, Amakusa\'s next words caused her ears to perk like a cat\'s.

"A mighty fine taste, young lady.
But I won\'t lose to you when I return the favor on White Day."

"Wawawa, really, Amakusa?!
Kya,
I can\'t wait, kya!"

Asmo leapt to her feet with delight at the promise.
And in the shadows, Beelzebub also leapt to her feet with delight for a slightly different reason.

"I... I get it! If I give chocolate as a present, on White Day I\'ll get three times as much back!

It\'s like going from rags to riches!
If I\'m patient now, I\'ll get a lot more back on White Day!
Beelz, you\'re no fool, you can definitely endure this for a month!"

Beelz was counting time between Valentine\'s Day and White Day, calculating whether she can endure the sacrifice of chocolate for the profit it will bring later.

The moment she figured that out, she took action.
In short, from whom does she want a return gift on White Day?

The partner to give her chocolate to was very easy to imagine.

In other words, it was someone who would make the most delicious return gift on White Day.

"Haha, hahaha.
T-this?.. For me?!.."
"Oh, yes, Gohda.
I thought of you, and made the best chocolate.
Please eat it!~"

As expected, she gave it to Gohda...
\'How selfish\', grumbled the other sisters.

Unlike Amakusa, Gohda did not seem to have much experience with receiving Valentine\'s Day chocolates.
He seemed to be rather bewildered.

"Ah, hahaha...
At this age, I never imagined I\'d get such delicious-looking chocolate from such a young girl...
It\'s quite awkward, nahahahaha..."

"C\'mon, eat, eat!
And on White Day, please give me three times as much in return!

La-
la-
la~ "
Gohda ate the chocolate in a single gulp, his face completely red.

...However, his cheeks returned to normal in an instant.

...Did it taste bad?..

"...Um,
is something wrong?.."

"Young lady...
Did I hear you say that you made this chocolate by hand?.."

"E... eh, that\'s right.
I made it!"

As Beelz shamelessly lied, Gohda stood up straight.
...There was nothing uncertain about his expression.

"......You have my thanks, young lady.
It\'s been a long time since such a taste has awoken me, Gohda, from mediocrity..
What skill... I accept this challenge, young lady!.."

"Wohhhh!

Such splendid chocolate from such a young lady!
One month remains until White Day!

I must depart to Belgium for training immediately!

I, Godha, shall not be defeated by this taaaaaaste!!!"
Beelz was rather taken aback by the outburst, but in any case, the next White Day would no doubt be a boisterous occasion...

"...I get it now.

Well, the basic idea, anyway.
Since there\'s no avoiding it, I\'ll be giving my chocolate away as well."

"Eh, wha, Mammon?!..
Who are you giving it to?!.."

Without answering, Mammon became a stake

and flew away with a clatter.

"Uryuu!
Candies!"

"This isn\'t just for you, share it with Ange...
Eh, where is she?"

"Uryuu,
she said she wanted to give chocolate to Battler and Amakusa, so she went shopping in Ginza."

"Ah, so Ange would rather use her money than make it herself.

Well, she should be coming back before long."

"I\'m sure Ange won\'t expect to get her own share of chocolate!
Let\'s surprise her!"
"That\'s a nice idea.
Afterwards, why don\'t we invite Lady MARIA too?
There\'s no rule against girls eating chocolate on Valentine\'s."

"Uryuu!

I want to eat
Mammon\'s chocolate,
I want to eat it,
uryuu~!"
"*giggle*
You can take your share."

"Then I will!"

"Ufufu, as for what I\'d like to eat...
aah, Sakutaro, I can\'t stand it anymooore, I\'m gonna eat you~ "

"Ukya?!
Gya!

Stop it, Mammon~,
ugya~,
uryu!"
"*grab*!

*chew*~!
Haa,
hey hey,
your ears...
Can I nibble on them?.."
"No, don\'t, uryuu~!"

"That Mammon, she\'s pretty clever!.."

"A heartwarming story might come out of this... but she\'s just nonchalantly hogging him,
Sakutaro belongs to all of us!"
"Who\'s next?
It feels like we\'re going from youngest to eldest."

"...In that case, I will go next."

"Belphe, you have someone in mind?"

"There are no men I treasure, but I can think of someone."

"Ah, I see."

The next to fly away was Belphegor.

The person she had in mind was, without any doubt, Rudolf.

She fought him one-on-one in EP3.
Such an old-fashioned duel must be a rather unforgettable memory to her.

"I don\'t know whether it\'s proper to give chocolate to a married man.
But please accept this as acknowledgement of a worthy opponent."

"My, I didn\'t expect to get chocolate from a young lady.
Thanks.
By the way,
were you alright after all that?"

"U, um, well, that sort of thing is ordinary for me.."

"You\'re too honest for a devil.
...I\'ve seen many women like you who take up troubles they don\'t need to.
It looks like a hardship, so that\'s the reason I worried."

"...T-there is nothing to be concerned about.
I am exemplary furniture, so I just fulfilled my duty."

Normally, no one worries about Belphe,
so when Rudolf was open-minded enough to be concerned about her, she was bewildered.

"Not so honest anymore, are you?
That side of you is pretty cute."

"Wh-what are you saying I wasn\'t honest about...

H-hey, you\'re getting too close...
I mean, you stink of tobacco!.."
"Turn your ear this way.
I\'ll whisper it to you..."

"L-like this?
O-okay..."

Belphe tilted her head unsuspectingly, since she was asked.

...Rudolf\'s mouth came close, and...
...

"Aaah,
...uwa-
uwawawawa...
W-what are you doing!?..
Stooop!~"
"Lucy, this isn\'t something we should be watching!
That bastard, he\'s got a wife and he\'s still pulling the moves on her!
...Eh?
Where\'s Levia?"

Meanwhile, Leviathan also decided to visit a former enemy.

Indeed, if Belphe gave her chocolate to Rudolf, there\'s nothing strange about her giving hers to Kyrie.

\'I didn\'t expect I\'d be the one getting chocolate\', Kyrie thought with a dry smile.

"I\'d rather not take chocolate from a girl...
But, thank you.
I appreciate it.."

"I, who rule envy, was defeated by your envy.
For the time being, I acknowledge your superiority."

"I don\'t really want to be acknowledged for such a thing.

Oh, my.
Did you make this? Delicious."

"It certainly is.
Rudolf also said it was delicious when Belphe gave him chocolate as well..."

"...Eh, sorry?
What did you just say?"

The warmth of that semblance of a smile that was on Kyrie\'s face quickly dropped down to absolute zero as she asked again.

Levia eagerly filled her in.

The two of them sat down next to each other, the chocolate was handed over, and their shoulders drew near...

"Hey, is that alright, him fooling around like that?"

"Eh?
*giggle*, no, no.
Rudolf isn\'t fooling around, for him, this is normal.

24x365x2349875663495733..."

"Kya-, just as expected from my mentor in jealousy!
More, more, more!
Show me more of that charming envy of yours, kya~"

With a smile icy enough to send liquid nitrogen drifting through the air, Kyrie walked away.

Shouting \'kya, kya\'s of encouragement, Levia followed after her.

It was an occasion of giving chocolate most suited for Leviathan of Envy...

After that, the only two remaining were Lucifer and Satan - the two of the Seven Sisters well-known for being obstinate.

It was Satan\'s turn next.

Although she hadn\'t decided who to give her chocolate to, Belphe and the others had given her an idea.

She decided to hand her chocolate to the one she had fought, as well.

"...There\'s no need."

Kanon gave that reply after looking at the chocolate with a single, suspicious glance.

Since the other sisters\' chocolate had been accepted casually and praised, and only hers was rejected, Satan was most upset by this.

"W-why didn\'t you just accept it!?
It\'s not like I\'ve put anything weird inside, it\'s normal chocolate, so just take it!"

"There is no reason for me to accept such a thing from you."

"It\'s, it\'s... Valentine\'s Day, idiot.
Isn\'t that good enough?!

Just take it!

Do you just like playing with girls\' hearts?!
You fool!"
"W-what!?..
Did you come here just to make fun of me?!"

Pathetic name-calling was especially deplorable to Kanon.

He had finally reached his boiling point.

"Get lost!
I refuse to accept anything from you!"

"Kya, ...what are you so angry about?!
I\'m giving you chocolate and you tell me to get lost!..
Just take it!
I don\'t like doing this either, you know!"

Satan could no longer conceal her bewilderment that all her younger sisters had succeeded, yet she could not.
Gritting her teeth and wishing for nothing more then to run away, she shoved the chocolate to Kanon.

...Kanon, too, was quite confused by all this.

Suddenly, Jessica\'s cheerful voice rang out from somewhere...

"Kanoooon~, are you there?
Eh, um, if you aren\'t busy!

...Eh, ugh!
Y-you\'re one of those seven!"
Jessica dropped the elegantly wrapped box she had brought to give to Kanon, and thrust her hands into her pockets.

When she pulled them out, she was already prepared to attack, having brass knuckles twinkling on both of her hands.

"W-why am I the only one who\'s this unlucky?!..
All my younger sisters didn\'t have any trouble!.."

"Don\'t you dare touch him!
Go away, furniture of the witch!
You don\'t stand a chance against me and Kanon!"

"Y-you!..
Don\'t get so cocky just because you had a power-up in EP4 all of a sudden!.."

"...Get lost.
I could handle you even by myself."

"W-why did this happen?!..
I just came to give you some chocolate!
Isn\'t it Valentine\'s Day?!
Why won\'t you even look at me?!

Why am I the only one with no luck?!
Everyone else had an easy time with it, why not me?!
Why, why, I don\'t get it!
Uuugggnnh!.."

"What I don\'t get is you!
Your chocolate\'s probably poisoned or something.
As if Kanon would ever eat something like that!"

"Guh... ugugugugu!
I\'m begging you to accept this, if I don\'t hand this over to somebody it\'s all over for me, so mock me as much as you want!

But I\'ll remember this, you shameless fools, and I will definitely kill you next time!"

Satan hurled the box at Kanon, her red-hot face twisted with vexation, and burst into a swarm of golden butterflies.

"...What was her deal?.."

"And don\'t come back again!
Grrrr!"

Jessica growled at the space where Satan had disappeared to, while Kanon continued to be perplexed.

The box Satan had hurled lay at Kanon\'s feet.

...As he wondered whether he should pick it up, Jessica grabbed it immediately.

"You definitely can\'t eat that demon\'s chocolate!
I\'ve decided.
I\'m going to help you get rid of this personally!"

"...I can do that myself..."

"No!
I\'ll handle it!
I won\'t allow this box to disturb you, grrrr!.."

With her conviction written on her face, Jessica snatched away the box.

Kanon didn\'t understand why Jessica was so determined to take that demon\'s chocolate.

"...I don\'t get it.
What did she come here for?"

"She\'s a demon, she definitely came to curse you somehow!..

Ah,
b-
by the way,
t-this, this is
for you!.."
Why did Satan\'s chocolate cause such a commotion?..

Kanon has been dragged into this messy chocolate situation by Jessica without understanding any part of it...

"Uuugh, hic, hic!.."

"Eh, Satan! How shame~ful!"

"She couldn\'t even gift a lousy box of chocolate, how piti~ful!"

The sisters teased Satan mercilessly.
...It\'s their unwritten law to mock whichever sister fails her task.

As they bragged on and on, Lucifer suddenly became anxious.

Although Lucifer likes to throw her influence around as the eldest sister, in reality she\'s the least competent of them.

Since Satan hadn\'t succeeded, she suddenly became frightened that she might fail as well.

...What to do, what to do!..
If I don\'t gift my chocolate, I\'ll make Ronove mad!
And my sisters will never let me hear the end of it!

"W-what to do...
I don\'t know anybody who would just accept it without making a fuss..."

Maybe George?

He\'s a nice guy, he ought to accept it casually.

...Ahh, but Shannon would surely get in my way.
She\'s really stubborn sometimes!

"...Maybe I could just throw it away
and pretend I\'ve given it to someone?"

Yeah, that\'s probably the best...

While they\'re busy tormenting Satan, I\'ll secretly dispose of this...

"We know what you\'re thinking, Lucy!"

"Hii!!!"

Satan-tormenting time had already come to an end.

And Satan had guessed that Lucifer would try to run off on her own in the midst of the chaos.

"She always bosses us around, then disappears when it\'s time for her to do her part!

Come on, everyone!
Don\'t let Lucy escape!"

"""Yes, Sis!"""

On Satan\'s orders, the younger sisters surrounded Lucifer, who collapsed to her knees in fright.

"Welll, Sis Lucifer?
Who are you going to give your chocolate to, I wonder?
Surely the eldest of us has an appropriately graceful and wonderful Valentine, oozing with love?.."

This is bad, I\'m trapped...
W-what to do... I have nobody to give it to...
What to do, what to do...

Lucifer turned pale.
It was plain as day on her face that she wanted nothing more then to run away.

"Who, who?" the younger sisters jeered at her.
Trembling, the eldest sister looked down in despair...

"Oh, if it isn\'t the ass sisters.
Getting along with each other the same as ever, ain\'t ya?"

"Wha-, ...Ushriomiya Battler!.."

"Yes, of course~
We, the Seven Sisters of Purgatory, are getting along just fine.

Isn\'t that right, everyone?!"

"""Yes, everything\'s just fine~!"""

Hurriedly, Lucifer wiped away the tears that had appeared in her eyes.

"...What\'s this box then?
Ah, I got it, it\'s for Valentine\'s Day!
Hehe, so you do have some normality in your lives.
For cold-blooded killers like you, this is pretty cute."

Battler noticed the box of chocolate which Lucifer was holding, and grinned.

...This is a golden opportunity.
Battler\'s in a good mood, so he might accept it...

"U-...
...Ushiromiya...
...Battler!"
"Ah?
What\'s up, ass-sis?"

"I\'m n-not an ass-sis! My name is Lucifer!.."

"Oh, sorry, my bad.
Well, Lucifer, how can I help you?"

"...H-here."

With her face red and her arms trembling, Lucifer thrust the chocolate box to Battler.

Battler, though he was often insensitive, understood the situation quickly.

"...Eh?

Eh,
...this is...
for me?"
"...P-please take it!.."

With the utmost seriousness, Lucifer pushed the chocolate to him.

She was frantic not to fail,
so that her younger sisters wouldn\'t tease her.

The younger sisters watched with malicious smirks.

But, in silence, they seemed to support the courage of their sister.

Battler winked, with the smile that was his family heirloom.

"...Eh..."

"Thanks.
Just for today, I\'ll make peace with you.
You have my gratitude."

"Oooooooh", the younger sisters\' voices rose in a cheer.
Only Satan clicked her tongue.

As for Lucifer, Battler was her saviour, and she even witnessed the sparkling halo above his head.

"This is great!
Did you make it?"

"W, well, I..."

"Yeah, this is devilishly delicious!
Thanks, Lucifer.
You\'ve got a knack for this.
If you ever stop being a cold-blooded killer, how about becoming a housewife?"

"...Hmph...
That\'s an inexcusable insult to furniture such as us."

"Kidding, kidding!

Well, thanks for the chocolate!
I\'ll pay you back on White Day, and until then, <see you again>!"

Realizing that any more compliments were likely to spoil the mood, Battler took his leave with those pretentious words.

"Hehhehehe!..
Did you see that?!

Just ask your elder sister Lucifer and Valentine\'s Day chocolate is a cinch!
I\'ll be treated to human hospitality on White Day, it seems."

"...Guess it\'s not that easy to break Lucy after all..."

"She really lucked out, with Battler appearing conveniently like that!"

"Luck is also a skill!
Ah~ wonderful, wonderful, truly wonderful.
The Seven Sisters of Purgatory have completed their task!
Sir Ronove will certainly praise us."

"Everyone except that clumsy Satan, right?"

"Ah, I have a plan for that, too!
We\'ll just tell him I did it in spirit!"

"Yeah, Satan\'s technique is pretty advanced.
She\'s the queen of tsundere.
Except without the dere."

"""Hahaha, hahahaha!"""

"Splendid work, Seven Sisters of Purgatory!
Come, come, let us report our success to Sir Ronove!"

""""""Yes, sis!""""""

Thanks to Ronove\'s chocolate, the seven sisters were able to pass this one day pleasantly...

The seven sisters reported the details to Ronove in the kitchen.

"How wonderful.
You must have had an entertaining day.
All of you may be dismissed, congratulations on your success."

"Thank you very much, please excuse us!"

""""""Excuse u~s, Sir Ronove!""""""

In truth, even before receiving the report, Ronove had known everything.

For him, rather then the sweetness of the chocolate, the variety that the chocolate had given to their day was far sweeter.

"Pukkukku.
Such a bittersweet day comes only once a year...
this kind of a story is pleasant once in a while.
Sharing that chocolate was truly a worthwhile endeavor."

"...Eh?

Have I forgotten someone?

Ah, but of course.
The starring role is none other then our mistress, BEATRICE.
Please, put her on camera.
Pukkukku!"

Ronove snapped his fingers, and the stage turned dark.

With a gift box in her hand, Beato searched around restlessly for Battler.

"Ah, there he is!
Battler, I found yoooou!
Happy Valentine\'s Day!"

"Huh, so even you celebrate Valentine\'s Day, Beato..."

After having finally finding Battler, Beato was in a great mood.

The gift box in her hand was decorated very luxuriously.

"Don\'t say this chocolate is... for me?.."

"*cackle, cackle*, know the honor and the glory
of being presented Valentine\'s Day chocolate by me!
Accept it on your knees!"

"As if receiving a gift from you is something to celebrate... You\'re a witch.
It\'s probably got some strange poison in it."

"How rude.
You may think that,
but I am a witch who can read the atmosphere.
I am not one to rely on nonsense like poisons!"

"...That\'s not particularly reassuring...
Well, I\'ll accept your feelings.
Not sure whether I\'ll eat it."

"Come on, eat~.
I made it from the bottom of my heart!"

...Beato also shamelessly lied about the chocolate Ronove had made.

"I see.
If it\'s handmade, there\'s probably nothing strange in it.

...Very well then,
allow me to bear witness to the cooking ability of the Golden witch."

Handmade by Beato...

Although he doubted that, he couldn\'t upset a woman by refusing her chocolate.
Battler decided to let Beato save face.

"*cackle, cackle*!
Now, open the box, and behold!"

"Alright.
...Eh?
But..."

"How is it?!

The delicious chocolate,
made by me!"

Battler stared
at exactly the same chocolate
he\'d received from Lucifer just a few minutes ago.

Hadn\'t that chocolate been handmade by Lucifer?

"Hey, just a minute, Beato.
Did you really make this?"

"Yup, it was all me!
I made it from my heart, full of feelings and emotions for you!~"

"Repetition request.
\'This chocolate was handmade by BEATRICE\'."
"Ugh?!
W-wha, wh, whaaat?!"

"Ha, just like I thought.
I knew you wouldn\'t be able to repeat it.

You got this from Lucifer, didn\'t you?"

"Lucifer?
What does Lucifer have to do with anything???"

"That chocolate of Lucifer\'s was certainly delicious.
She may be a cold-blooded killer, but the chocolate she makes is delicious.
If she became a little more graceful, she\'d make a great wife.
I was touched by her feelings, and intend to return them on White Day."

"But what about you?!
You\'re lying about making your own chocolate, what the hell!?
I don\'t need any chocolate from someone like you!"

"N-noooooo, Battleeeeeeeeeer, that\'s wrooooong..."

But Battler had swiftly taken his leave.

Sobbing noisily behind him, Beato had no idea how her lie had been exposed.

But she did know one thing - Lucifer had been connected to it in some way.

"Luciferrrrrrrrrrrr, my furniture...
You ruined everything!
Because of you,
I was caught in a lie about having made Ronove\'s chocolate myself!
Punishment, torture!!!"

She could say these very same words to herself, as she shamelessly lied too...

And thus the sun sets on the Valentine\'s Day for the lying witch...

And on White Day, when Lucifer received her return gift from Battler,
she unexpectedly thought to herself that Valentine\'s Day isn\'t that bad...

The end.
Pukuku.
