A monotonous electronic sound kept on repeating.
The theme of that room was a so‐called "hygienic" emotionless white.
...It was a room of a certain university hospital.
An ordinary person wouldn\'t be able to afford the cost of even a single night in this room,
 a room which neither her doctors, nor she herself, had any doubts would be the last she ever stayed in...
Was the person on the bed...
............Eva?
She looked haggard and aged, to the point that you would not believe it was her, unless you were told.
A well‐built man in a suit, waiting in the corner near the door, was having a conversation with the outside in a low voice, over the intercom.
...He was a guard protecting Eva\'s person.
After telling the person on the other end of the intercom to wait, he approached Eva\'s bed.
...Eva had been awake for a while.
......However, she stared at a single point in empty space, as though her mind was not in the same place.
"......Ange (縁寿)‐san has arrived in the lobby below.
 Should we let her pass?"
"................................."
For a long time, Eva didn\'t answer.
However, bit by bit, her eyes began to regain their focus, and she gave a small nod, indicating that she didn\'t mind if they called Ange.
...Eva herself had been the one to call her.
 And she was right on time.
Eva now refused to meet anyone without an appointment made in advance.
The reason the room was dark, even though it was still light outside, was because the curtains were closed.
...There was always one guard waiting in the room, and three more waiting in the corridor and the lobby.
They were all there to protect Eva\'s person...
Eventually, there was the sound of a knock.
Also, there was a message from the intercom that the guest\'s body check had been completed with no problems.
The door was unlocked, then opened,
 .........and a woman of about high‐school age was standing there.
"Chairman.
 Ange‐san has arrived."
Eva reacted and turned her face towards the guest.
However, instead of reacting to the guard\'s call, maybe it would be better to say that she reacted to the smell of Ange\'s makeup.
......Having been shut up in this room for so long, Eva was sensitive to small changes in smell.
"........................
 So you came.
 ......Ange."
"......Yes, I did.
 You did call me."
On Eva\'s face, you couldn\'t find the expression of one warmly welcoming their niece.
...And on Ange\'s face, you couldn\'t see the expression of one pleased to see their aunt.
Eva waved her arm, which had grown as thin as a withered branch, and motioned for the guard to leave.
The guard bowed silently and went out into the hall.
"......It\'s not only stuffy, but dark too.
 Why don\'t you have the curtains opened...?"
"...............And then the hitman you hired will shoot through the window, is that what you\'re planning......?"
".........If it came to that, I\'d much rather be the one paid to do the hit.
 All I\'d have to do is relax at home for a month and the job would take care of itself."
"...Heheheheh, hahhahhahhahha......"
Their discussion was quite morbid for an aunt and niece.
...However, they didn\'t look like they were joking.
......At the very least, Eva did believe that someone was after her life.
All of the Ushiromiya family\'s massive fortune had come into the possession of Ushiromiya Eva.
...It was said that this fortune also included the ten tons of hidden gold that Ushiromiya Kinzo was rumored to have kept concealed.
They could do nothing while this vast wealth was in the hands of the cunning, sly, and extremely suspicious Eva,
 ......but it was rumored that if it passed on to Ange, who was no more than a young girl, certain people were plotting to snatch it away at once.
By now, Eva and Ange were Kinzo\'s only descendants.
......If Eva died, all of the wealth would go to Ange.
...And if Ange were to be killed as well,
 ......that wealth would go to the family of Ange\'s mother, Kyrie.
In this sense, not only Eva, but Ange as well,
 ...was in a position where it wouldn\'t be odd at all for her life to be targeted by some unknown person.
......And Eva had hated Ange for a long time.
Because, after losing her precious only son George,
 ......she had learned that the only one who had survived to inherit her own wealth...
was Ange, who had been absent from that family conference twelve years ago.
Eva shunned Ange, hated her, even detested her.
She isolated Ange in a special school, and separated her from the youth and happiness normal people have, trying to deprive her life of all opportunity.
......However, Eva had succumbed to an incurable illness,
 and ironically, ...her remaining life was estimated to be the same as Kinzo\'s had been at that family conference twelve years earlier...
Both Eva and Ange...hated each other.
Even though they were each other\'s last blood relatives, ...they hated each other so much that they hoped the other would die quickly...
".........And?
 Why did you go to all the trouble of calling for me...?"
"......I don\'t have much time left.
 ......These quack doctors still have no idea what I was poisoned with.
 .........But I know.
 I\'m sure it\'s that secret assassination drug, the one that foreign intelligence agency was using."
"...Ooh, I\'m going to be killed, I\'m going to be killed...!!
 Aren\'t you lucky, very soon, I will die, and then you will be so relieved...!"
".................................
 ...What a pitiable person."
This always happened.
......She immediately deviated from the main topic, distorting it into a more unsettling discussion.
Eva, who was full of suspicion, believed that someone was always after her life.
Indeed, after inheriting the vast wealth of the Ushiromiya family,
 she had used wild methods just like Kinzo had done in the past, and had repeatedly made money by any means necessary, creating many enemies along the way.
With a massive supply of capital, she had launched aggressive takeovers against businesses which were starting to have rapid growth,
 making them buy it back at a high price under the guise of reconciliation.
......Ironically, it was the same type of action that her husband\'s company had been hit with twelve years ago...
She had repeated this constantly for the past twelve years.
......She had also earned a lot of hatred.
If her husband had heard of this from beyond the grave, he might have defended her, saying that this was because of the loneliness from losing her family.
......However, no one who knew her now would come to her defense.
For some time, Eva waxed eloquent about exactly how her life was being targeted,
 listing off names of people who likely held hatred for her,
 and sneering at the fact that she still hadn\'t been killed.
Even when Ange heard her own name included in that list,
 her expression did not change significantly, and she waited indifferently for Eva to tire herself out...
".........You know what?
 ............I really hate...
you."
"I\'m honored.
 Same here."
".........I built this future for George\'s sake.
 ......To think that it would be snatched away by you.
 ...To think that it would be stolen by Rudolf\'s daughter...
 .........I can\'t bear it.
 ......To think that not only will I not leave a child,
 ...but even my fortune will be stolen,
 .........that, to me, is just...
...unforgivable............!"
"......In that case, why don\'t you give all of your fortune to charity?
 What happened to all those religious people you\'ve requested so many times?"
"............*cackle*cackle*cackle*!
 They all say the same thing.
 ...My excessive wealth has become a burden to me.
 They always say something about how I need to give it up and cleanse myself.
 ......Ahhahahahahahahahaha!
 And then the idea came to me.
 To stop donating!"
For a time, Eva had invited in the founders of several strange new religious cults, perhaps looking for peace in her heart.
...But in the end, they did not give her heart any relief,
 and only further increased her suspicion...
".........If you\'ve got money to burn, why don\'t you start buying up thoroughbreds and make some corned beef?"
"I\'ve thought of something even more interesting.
 ......*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!
 I\'ve racked my brains over it a lot.
 What could I do to make things horrible for you?"
"......I thought about just killing you.
 I also thought about erasing all of my wealth, leaving you penniless, and kicking you out of the Ushiromiya family or something."
"Wouldn\'t that be wonderful?
 A lady brought up prim and proper, made to crawl around and prowl for moldy bread and muddy water.
 Aaah, that too would be truly glorious,
 *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!"
"............Having fun?"
"Oh, yes.
 It\'s fun to scare you...
 ......But very soon, I will die.
 ...So I thought about how I can continue to cause you pain even after I die."
".........And then, ......*cackle*cackle*!
 It was surprisingly simple.
 ......I called you because I wanted to tell you about it."
".....................I have midterms coming up.
 Keep it brief."
"...I have decided.
 I will have you inherit all of my fortune."
".................................
 ...Huh."
"Not only that,
 ......I decided that until the very day that I die,
 ...I\'ll increase that fortune as much as I can, inflate it to massive proportions and have you inherit all of it.
 ...*cackle*cackle*, can you even imagine what that would be like...?"
"......No idea.
 Because I\'m stupid."
"Ehhehhehheh, *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!
 No, you wouldn\'t have any idea, would you...!
 Look forward to it, it really is fun, being rich...!
 Every day, from morning till night, monsters from across Japan will come to play."
"From now on, your entire private life will be followed by talk shows and weekly magazines.
 The media criticize me no matter what I do or don\'t do!
 If I donate, they\'ll attack me as a bourgeois, and if I begrudge them that money, I\'ll be abused as a miser."
"Oh, every day really is wonderful, you see?
 I realized that I would love to invite you to that kind of life, when you are so young and have so much ahead of you.
 Isn\'t that just to die for?"
".........The public is right in its criticism of all that you\'ve done."
"*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!
 Yes, yes, I\'m sure that they are.
 ...Go ahead, insult me as much as you want.
 And then you will be burdened with that criticism."
"......Japanese culture says that good people live in honorable poverty, while the wealthy should die.
 No matter what you do or do not do, you will eventually be held up as a symbol of envy and hate from across Japan."
"...*cackle*cackle*cackle*!
 I wonder how twisted your life will become after living this way...?"
"You will have no allies!
 No one will listen to your worries.
 Insulting you will become a public sport.
 And no one can stop that!"
"Oh, Ange!
 Ehheheheheheh,
 oh, I\'m really looking forward to it.
 ...I wonder how you will live your life, and how you\'ll end it...!
 Relish your life of being unable to trust anyone in the world, love anyone, or talk with anyone...!!"
"I\'ll be patiently waiting for you in hell, waiting for you to come falling down, bringing that story of hardship with you.
 Heheheheh,
 ahahhahahahahahahaha,
 waah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah,
 ghhkk,
 *cough*cough*,
 ghah!!"
Her insane laughter turned into a painful cough.
Without changing her expression in the slightest, looking completely unconcerned,
 ......Ange stared at the only survivor of Rokkenjima.
Perhaps because he found the violent coughing odd, the guard flew in as he gave a short knock on the door.
Ange glanced at him, wordlessly showing that she hadn\'t moved a step from where she had been.
......Ange was prepared for some kind of trap to frame her in Eva\'s death.
 However, that was fortunately a needless anxiety.
As the guard rubbed Eva\'s back, he poured hot water from a thermos into a mug.
As he did, Eva kept coughing, looking like she was in pain.
Ange thought that this was probably the final form of the witch of Rokkenjima, and the last she would be able to see.
Eventually, Eva was able to moisten her throat and regain her normal breathing.
...However, the glittering madness inside her eyes hadn\'t subsided in the slightest.
"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!
 That cursed mass of gold and the inheritance of the Ushiromiya headship,
 ......as well as...
.........the name of the Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}...
are now yours.
 ............Enjoy your insane, twisted life fitting for the name of the witch...!"
"I don\'t care about those.
 Enough of that, just tell me this.
 ......What happened on Rokkenjima that day?
 .........I don\'t believe that there was an accident.
 Tell me the truth about what happened that day, and why Mom and Dad and Nii‐san died......!!"
"*cackle*cackle*...!
 Oh, that must be the best way to harass you, mustn\'t it?
 ......What happened on that day?
 What happened on this very day in 1986...?
 ......You want to know what they said before they died, ......don\'t youuuu...?"
"I woOOn\'t tell yooOOOoouu,
 aaahhhyahhyahhyahhyah!!
 I\'ll leave behind the cursed gold!
 But you know what? I\'ll take the truth you desire with me to hell...!
 That\'s the best way I can harass you!!"
"Upset?
 If you want to hear, try going to hell and asking your family there!
 In that case, you better die right now, right?!
 Ahhahahahahaha, why don\'t you just give up and die now and foreverrr?!
 Waaahhah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah!!"
That laugh continued until she started coughing again.
And that cough did not subside until she started moaning and going into convulsions......
October 4th, 1986.
On Rokkenjima, the Ushiromiya family\'s customary and final family conference was held.
And on the next day, October 5th...
an "extremely unfortunate accident" occurred, and the Ushiromiya family was wiped out.
"As good luck would have it", Ushiromiya Eva escaped from that,
 and succeeded almost all of the Ushiromiya family\'s fortune.
However, due to the many turbulent rumors surrounding the Ushiromiya family, the way Eva acted afterwards,
 and her unnatural actions at the time of the "unfortunate accident", there was public controversy over whether this might have been a plot to get all of the inheritance for herself.
Under pressure from the public, prosecutors attempted numerous investigations,
 and the media began tracing the outline of the murder plot under the name of Rokkenjimagate,
 but in the end, they were not able to find sufficient proof that this "unfortunate accident" was a crime.
However, because the media continued to give the impression that Rokkenjimagate was a murder plot by Eva,
 public opinion began to believe that she was the true culprit.
...Of course, all that easily condemnable overbearing financial activity which she had carried out using that vast wealth...
left a bad impression that only made matters worse.
Every time she did something and the rumors started spreading, the talk shows would bring back Rokkenjimagate,
 blaming the justice system by saying that she was the true culprit, and that the only reason that she hadn\'t been arrested was because even the police had been bribed.
And the impression that she was an evil criminal grew stronger and stronger...
Her heart eventually degenerated,
 ...and ironically, it began to transfigure her into the kind of human that the public expected...
By now, Eva had no one she trusted, and no family.
......Her beloved husband, Hideyoshi, was already no more, and the talk shows would occasionally mention his company,
 saying that it was run recklessly, while criticizing and disgracing its former accomplishments.
Even her beloved son, George,
 was dramatized as the stereotypical "rich, lazy son" that the public expected,
 ...and no one even attempted to find out what a simple and honest character he had possessed.
...As to how much all of this hurt Eva and ran her to ruin, ...no one was interested.
The public was only interested in the idea of an evil woman who had gone so far as to kill her whole family to become a multimillionaire,
 and in what kind of pitiful final years she would lead.
So she changed more and more,
 ...until eventually...
...Eva\'s personality was transfigured to the point that she was treated as a lunatic......
It was said that she sometimes remembered that this was exactly the same way her father Kinzo, who she had once admired, had been in his later years,
 and laughed at herself with scorn...
And, on the day of that final family conference...
Because Ushiromiya Rudolf\'s daughter, Ange, had been sick and had stayed with her mother\'s family, she had not participated.
At the age of six, she lost her family and gained Eva as her guardian.
Since Ange had become Eva\'s only blood relative,
 Eva "took very good care of her".
She had imposing guards always surrounding Ange\'s person, to prevent her from coming to harm.
......Ange had even her right to play with friends, to come home from school together, and to enjoy the seasons together...stolen.
"So that she can live a full and pleasant school life",
 Eva sent Ange to an elegant boarding school which took care of her every need, completely isolating her from the world.
She didn\'t even know the popular songs that girls her age might hum.
She was never once given a chance to enjoy window shopping with her friends, or stuff her mouth with crêpes,
 ...much less an encounter with a member of the opposite sex to make her heart throb.
Ange did not have a single friend.
 If anyone carelessly acted friendly with Ange, they would be scolded by the guards, or else the teachers.
......All of them were strictly ordered not to let the peasants approach the daughter of the esteemed Ushiromiya family.
During that time, the talk shows were always talking about Ushiromiya Eva, and always spreading rumors about her many financial evil deeds.
......Those who found out that she was her "daughter" naturally began to keep their distance.
...Even now, she was called a witch at school, and any time something adverse happened,
 it was baselessly whispered as truth that the school was operating according to her wishes, and that she had something to do with it.
The environment makes the person.
By now, she had a heart as hardened as those around her feared.
...She trusted no one, and didn\'t even try.
She loved no one, and didn\'t even try.
And on top of all of this, when Eva caught an incurable illness,
 it was whispered that this too had been planned, and this time, Ange was set up as the mastermind...
Everyone whispered that the daughter of a witch was a witch.
Even the talk shows and the weekly magazines whispered that.
...So Ange, too,
 because of that,
 no,
 as though it might as well be true, accepted it.
Therefore, since she already believed that she was a witch,
 when she heard that the name of the Golden Witch was being turned over to her, she felt nothing if not completely unfazed.
However, she was at least sure of one thing.
This title of witch that she had inherited would definitely never be inherited by anyone else.
She would be the last head of the Ushiromiya family, and the last, isolated, Golden Witch......
Ange could be seen on the roof of a skyscraper.
Compared to the winds of the world which had beaten down upon her until now, this strong, cold wind was warm and pleasant.
Below her lay a beautiful nighttime scene, and a dazzling river of red and white lights.
It was a clear sky tonight.
 ...So there really should have been countless stars stretching out over the sky.
 ...However, the light from the ground was so bright, you couldn\'t see them at all.
...Ange couldn\'t help but think that what she really sought lay somewhere in that unseen starlight.
The world of reality below her looked so far away from here.
...This place felt to her as the closest to the world she should really be in.
............There was only one thing that Ange cursed:
Why had I not been able to go to that family conference, on that day twelve years ago?
If I had gone, I would probably have been able to be with my family forever.
...Recently, ...I\'ve been having a dream about my family, over and over again.
My self of twelve years ago calls out frantically, urging them not to go to the family conference.
But both Mom and Dad are too far away, and my hand won\'t reach them.
I reach for the hand of Battler nii‐san, who always really loved me—for the hand that would always pat my head—
 .........but even though it looks like it\'s so close to reaching, even that falls short.
For some reason, I started having that dream over and over again.
......Whenever I have that dream,
 I repeat my useless effort inside the dream, trying to stretch out my hand even more forcefully.
If only Battler nii‐san at least could have lived...
.........then perhaps, at least the two of us could have supported each other through life in this cold and lonely reality.
But his hand never reaches me.
So even if I climb to the roof of a building as tall as this one,
 ......I am distantly separated from all of them.
......A mysterious girl appears in my dreams and urges me.
That girl in my dreams urges me to arrive at the truth of what happened twelve years ago.
"........................
 ......If I could learn...
what happened to Dad and everyone else on that day,
 ............would they come back?
 At least one of them...!"
There was no way...
...that anyone existed who could answer those words.
I understand.
 .........In this world, I have no family, no friends, no one.
So,
 ............let\'s go.
 ...Let\'s go home.
......To where my family is.
From the beginning, ...Ange\'s figure had been on the far side of the fence.
The scenery below her eyes was distant, beautiful, and so fantastical that it did not give rise to the slightest bit of fear.
If I face down, I\'ll surely be taken to the world below.
......So I faced up.
Because I wanted to be taken to the world above, the world where my family was.
.........Who cares about vast wealth.
 Who cares about cursed gold.
Who cares about the Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice}.
What I really want...isn\'t something that even a mountain of gold will help me obtain...
What I need for that...is just the small amount of courage...to take a single step forward.
............Just then,
 ...I definitely heard a voice.
I knew that voice.
The voice that had always......called to me in my dreams...
Before my eyes, ......in other words, in mid‐air above that jet‐black nighttime scenery...
......There was the figure of that girl I had seen in my dreams...
She spoke again, with the same voice I had heard inside my dreams.
".........Your assistance is needed."
"...My...
.........assistance......?
 Who needs it......?"
".........Your family needs it.
 ...Your family is eternally imprisoned in the two‐day span that began on this day twelve years ago."
"I‐...if I save them,
 ......does that mean my family will come back?!"
When I asked the question I most wanted to ask, the girl cruelly stopped talking and hung her head.
"......I cannot promise that.
 The enemy is the Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice}.
 ...A mighty opponent.
 I cannot compete with her.
 ......But another Golden Witch might be able to manage something."
"............I, I don\'t know...what you\'re talking about."
"......The only one who can oppose the {f:5:Beatrice} of 1986...
is the final {f:5:Beatrice}, of 1998.
 .........In other words, you.
 Ange.
 .........{f:5:Ange Beatrice}."
"That witch from twelve years ago...
...took away my family.........?"
"Yes.
 She is responsible for what happened to your family.
 ............The source that always leads to your future of isolation."
"........................
 ......My...
...family\'s...
......killer."
"......In exchange, I will search for the fragment with the ideal world that you wish for, the world where your family comes home.
 .........But I can\'t promise you that your desire will be granted.
 ...The game board of the 1986 {f:5:Beatrice} is quite perfect."
"......I had planned on bringing you that ideal fragment as a present today, but I still can\'t find it.
 ............It\'s a very firm fate.
 I haven\'t seen the likes of it since I fought with {f:5:Lambdadelta}."
".............................................
 I,
 ......I don\'t know...
...what you\'re talking about."
".........I\'m giving you a chance for revenge.
 ...In exchange, I promise to find and bring you the happiest resolution that it is possible for you to receive."
"..............................Revenge......"
"......It may be a fruitless effort.
 Even if you succeed in your revenge, there\'s no definite proof that your family will return.
 Even with a miraculous probability, you may only be able to bring one person back."
...Ange now understood the meaning of that dream.
......That dream where it seemed that, with just a little bit more, her hand might at least be able to reach Battler nii‐san.
"A miraculous probability......is still higher than zero, right...?
 Is it about one percent...?"
"......All probability values are powerless before the result.
 So I cannot tell you that number."
"But unlike if I don\'t do anything, there definitely is a small possibility."
"Yes.
 As long as you do not throw your hope away.
 ...But prepare yourself.
 It is extremely close to zero."
"..................
 Alright.
 I\'m in."
"......Are you sure?
 You\'ll probably never be able to come back here again."
"This is not the world where I belong.
 ......And...as for the world where I do belong...I\'ll find it myself.
 Tell me your name."
"The Witch of Miracles, {f:5:Bernkastel}.
 And by that name,
 I acknowledge you as the Golden Witch, {f:5:Ange Beatrice}.
 ......As of now, you are a true witch."
The instant she proclaimed that I was a witch...
...I felt dizzy, as though something inside me had changed drastically.
Just then, I heard a slam.
...It was the sound of the door connecting the staircase to the roof being opened.
There were Aunt Eva\'s guards.
...“Guards” only in name.Aren\'t they the cage that\'s closest to me, shutting me in?
They saw that I was already on the other side of the fence and dashed forward, horrified.
"20, target found.
 Requesting assistance on the roof."
"Ange‐san...!
 We were looking for you!
 It\'s dangerous there, so quickly, come this way!"
".........What\'s that?"
"......My fan club.
 ...I\'m pretty popular."
"No point in getting caught.
 .........Let\'s go."
Looking annoyed, {f:5:Bernkastel} turned on her heels.
 ...In the jet black sky.
Watching that perfectly casual gesture, I followed her as though it was completely normal.
"Ange‐san!!!
 Wait!
 Don\'t be hasty, look ooooooooooouuuut!!"
"Oh, it\'s no good, it\'s no goddamn good at all.
 Time to go. <See you again>."
"Please send a limo to get me.
 \'Cause everyone else will be with me too.
 See you."
