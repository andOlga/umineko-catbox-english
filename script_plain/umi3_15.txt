...Thirty minutes had already passed since Rudolf\'s group had left the guesthouse.
By any measure, their return was too late.
...And Krauss and Natsuhi, who were waiting by the entrance, were by now about as restless as they could stand.
The chain was set on the door.
 That was a precaution in the event that Rudolf\'s group was attacked, and the master key was stolen from them.
For that reason, they needed to wait by the entrance like this for the others to return...
"......They really are taking too long.
 You don\'t think something happened to them...?"
"...............Hmm..."
Krauss glanced between the clock and the door, struggling to feign composure.
"If...by some chance they were not to return......"
"...A terrible thought, but it looks as though we should ready ourselves for that possibility.
 ......It really was reckless, after all."
"Th‐that is what I said...!
 Why did they go outside when they knew it was this dangerous...!
 How foolish!
 Why go outside, even though Rosa‐san had just been attacked...?!!"
".........Nothing will come from saying that now.
 ...In any event, there are now three adults in the guesthouse.
 Me, you,
 ......and Eva, who\'s asleep with a high fever."
At that time, there was the forceful sound from the hallway of a door being opened, and Eva\'s shrieking voice.
...That voice kept calling Hideyoshi\'s name.
 ......It seemed as though the high fever had given her a bad dream or something, and now she was calling her husband\'s name.
"Eva‐san...
what is it, are you alright...?"
"Wh‐...where is my husband?!
 My husband isn\'t here!!
 He promised that he\'d stay with me the whole time!
 He promised that he\'d hold my hand the whole time!!"
...Krauss was taken aback by this attitude of hers, which she had never shown in front of him before, but Natsuhi understood her feelings.
"......C‐calm down...
 Hideyoshi‐san is with Rudolf‐san and Kyrie‐san, and they\'re outside right now."
"Outside?!?!
 Whwh‐why,
 he promised that he\'d stay with me the whole time,
 why did he go outside?!
 You mustn\'t go outside, the witch is outside, you mustn\'t go, you\'ll be killed!!
 Waaaaaaaaagggggggghhh...!!"
"...Eva, calm yourself.
 ......Hideyoshi‐san is back in the mansion with Rudolf and Kyrie‐san."
"Why did he have to go to the mansion?!!
 Why did you let him outside when it\'s safe in here?!!
 Why did he go back to the mansion?!!"
"..................
 ......They went to get enough food to last until tomorrow.
 ...Hideyoshi‐san was worried about your health, and he told us so..."
"When will they come back?!
 When will he come back?!
 He can\'t go outside, not to the rose garden, not to the mansion!!
 The witch is there, the Golden Witch is walking around!
 If she finds him he\'ll be killed, he\'ll definitely be killed!!
 When will my husband come back?!"
".........They left here thirty minutes ago.
 We are waiting for their return."
"Th‐thirty minutes?!
 That makes no sense, why would it take him so much time to go to the mansion, get food, and come back?!
 And why are you two just standing around here?!"
"We have to go get him!!
 Quick, we have to go to where he is!!
 Hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii!!"
Eva had probably had quite a nightmare.
 ...And after waking up and discovering that it still wasn\'t over, she could no longer hide her confusion.
Natsuhi tried calming her down, but it only made Eva\'s emotions explode all the more.
......Maybe they heard that disturbance.
 The lobby door opened slightly, and Battler and the kids, who should have been upstairs, poked their faces out.
Krauss, Natsuhi, Eva.
 And Battler, George, Jessica, Nanjo.
...Everyone in the guesthouse was gathered by the entrance, and understood the current situation.
"I agree with Mother.
 We should go to check on Father and the others."
"Yeah, you\'re right.
 There\'s also the chance that their load is too heavy and they\'re having trouble carrying it.
 They should welcome some extra hands."
"......R‐Rosa‐san was attacked not long ago.
 ...There\'s a possibility that this is a second disaster.
 We should act with caution here and—"
"Don\'t be ridiculous!!
 Act with caution and what?!
 Are you saying we should stand by and let my husband die when he might be praying for help?!
 I\'m going to look, the cowards can stay here!!"
Looking agitated, Eva raised her gun.
Judging by her expression, it would be useless for anyone to try to stop her.
...George, who realized that first, raised his head.
"I\'ll go too.
 You will too, right, Battler‐kun?
 The more people, the better...!"
"S‐sure!!
 Auntie Eva, we\'re coming even if you tell us not to."
"...I, I\'m coming too...!
 I\'ll be damned if I\'m gonna be the only one hiding where it\'s safe...!"
"Jessica, you must not go outside!!
 You are to stay here with me.
 Do you understand?!"
She was essentially implying that those three had already been killed anyway, so it was pointless to go outside.
Natsuhi also realized that she had made a deep gouge in Eva\'s heart, but she said those words strongly as Jessica\'s mother.
"..................You\'re right.
 That would probably be best.
 Nii‐san, you and your family keep watch over the guesthouse."
"This is my family\'s and Battler‐kun\'s family\'s problem.
 And I wonder if Doctor Nanjo would come too.
 Just in case of the worst."
".........In the hall of the mansion, Battler, Eva, George, and Nanjo...
found the bodies of Rudolf, Kyrie, and Hideyoshi."
".........The fourth twilight through the sixth twilight?
 Then, the corpses were pierced through the forehead, chest, and stomach with those demon stakes?"
"Yes.
 ......Into Rudolf\'s forehead,
 into Hideyoshi\'s chest,
 and into Kyrie\'s stomach: one demon stake buried into each."
"The clothing on all three was disordered, and because of this, it is thought that they had been fighting or running away.
 Since the three bodies were not found right next to each other, it is hypothesized that after coming into contact with the culprit, they attempted some form of resistance."
".........With stakes, in the forehead, chest, and stomach.
 ......Horrible, just like usual..."
"................................."
Even though Ronove knew it would be superfluous, he thought that maybe he should tell Battler.
...In actuality, the witch had killed them in a much more horrible way.
......Beato had advised the witch to restrain herself, which was why the corpses had been left so undamaged.
The new and brutal witch, thinking that all she needed to do was get the "gouged with a stake" part right,
 ......might even have just stuck a stake into a lump of meat that wasn\'t even shaped like a Human.
Rosa\'s and Maria\'s corpses would probably have been especially striking.
 ...If they had been killed as the Golden Witch had wished, just how gruesome would the exposed corpses have been?
Beato had changed that into a kind of killing that Battler would have called "still better".
Wanting to have Beato\'s small bit of thoughtfulness appreciated, he thought of telling Battler about that.
...But, for Battler, that might do more harm than good.
 To humans, the gap between being alive and being dead is very large.
To ask for Beato\'s feelings to be accommodated on the grounds that she had changed it to a better way of dying...
might have made it possible for a demon to pardon her, ......but there was no way it would work the same way for a Human.
Understanding this, Ronove remained silent even though he knew of Beato\'s modest effort...
"Just like usual, let\'s start by checking whether the corpses are dead.
 ......Ronove, please, declare it in red."
"...................................."
"Hey, can\'t you hear me?
 ...Please, declare it in red.
 This is a repetition request.
 "Rudolf, Kyrie, and Hideyoshi are dead"."
"...............My apologies.
 Allow me to decline from repeating that."
"What...?
 That\'s so sudden... What are you planning...?"
By now, proclaiming the death of the victims in red was almost a given in this battle.
Refusing to do that was almost like losing by default.
...So when Ronove declined as his first move, Battler was dumbfounded.
"My apologies.
 I hereby humbly relinquish my right to be Milady\'s agent.
 ...Accordingly, I cannot repeat that in red.
 ......The only one qualified to repeat that...is Milady."
"........................"
"...It is a valid point.
 Ronove is but an agent for Beato\'s side.
 ......If Ronove steps down from the position of agent, and Battler‐kun will not accept Beato as an opponent,
 ...a new agent must be created."
"......There is no new agent.
 ......Please, Battler‐sama.
 Please accept Milady as your game partner once more."
"............Sorry,
 but that\'s not happening.
 ......I definitely won\'t accept that unpleasant, ruthless bitch as my opponent.
 ...Refusing to accept that is the reason I won\'t abandon this game."
"Regarding your point about Milady being unpleasant, I apologize in her stead.
 I shall obtain Milady\'s pledge that she will not take unpleasant actions again."
"..............................
 ......Yeah, right."
"...Battler‐kun.
 ...I also apologize as that child\'s master.
 I will give her a thorough talking‐to, so would you please forgive her just this once?"
"......Hey, hey, quit that.
 You\'re making it sound like I\'m the bad guy."
"...And no matter how much you guys apologize, it won\'t reach my ears.
 ......If Beato can say that from her own mouth,
 ............well, it\'s not like I\'m not gonna listen to her."
"............Alright.
 If that is the only condition under which you will accept that child again, let us have her apologize."
".........Ronove.
 Call for that child.
 Is that alright, Battler‐kun...?"
"...............Tch.
 ...Do whatever you want.
 But don\'t expect me to forgive her.
 ......Go on, call for that irritating witch."
"...You have my thanks, Battler‐sama.
 .........I will call her now.
 ......Milady, Battler‐sama is calling for you."
After a few heartbeats, gold butterflies gathered together in midair and created Beato\'s form.
...It was much more docile than the way she had appeared before now.
"............Did you call, Ronove?"
"...I believe you heard.
 ......Is there anything you have to say, from your own mouth...?"
"...................................."
".............................."
It looked as though Beato shrunk slightly under Battler\'s cold gaze.
Several times, Beato made an effort to get the words out of her mouth, but that didn\'t work so well,
 ......and she was just as awkward as someone trying to light a match during a freezing winter with frozen hands...
Even as she did that, the game board was proceeding...
In the hall, they had just found the bodies of the new victims, and had broken down crying...
"......Dad,
 ......Kyrie‐san...
 ...UooOOOOOOooooOOOooohhhh...
 UOOOOoooooOOOOoooohhhhh..."
"Oh honey, ...honeyyyy... uuuuuuuuuhuuuuuuughhhuuuhuuhuu...!!"
"...Mother,
 ......stay strong......
 ......You\'re not the only one who\'s...
...crushed and...
...sad......!"
"........................They probably died instantly.
 ...Even if we had arrived immediately after they fell, I am sure that it would have been too late..."
"No, it wouldn\'t!!
 He would definitely have been alive!!
 His chest was stabbed with this thing...!
 My husband must have died in extreme pain...!!"
"If we had come faster, ...he would have been saved, I just know it!
 I just know it!!
 UuuuuwaaAAAaaaaAAAAaaaaaahhh..."
"...Battler‐kun... I know it\'s horrible, but......you have to stay strong......"
"...............I\'m fine, ...I really am, Aniki...
 ...Let me cry just a bit longer...
 ......Compared to you people, this is nothing...
 I should be the least sad...!
 So if you let me cry just a little longer, ......I\'ll be fine..."
"That isn\'t true...
 ......I can understand how much it must be hurting your heart to have lost both parents...
 ...I still have my mother.
 ...I\'ve got it much better than you, Battler‐kun..."
"No, you haven\'t!!
 You have it the worst, George‐aniki...
 ......I understand, Aniki..."
"...Out of all of us, ...you\'re the most devastated, and the most in pain!!
 I know that...
so I can\'t keep on snivelling like this...!!
 Uuuuuuuughhuuugh!!"
"......Why......do you say that......?"
"To me, Dad and Kyrie‐san......were people I\'d eventually part with when I became an independent adult.
 Since they\'re parents, it\'s fated that they\'d die before their children.
 ...It\'s just that it happened a little early...!"
".........But it\'s not like that for you, Aniki.
 You didn\'t just lose a parent you\'d part with eventually.
 .........You also lost someone you should have lived your whole life with,
 ............you lost Shannon‐chan as well...!!"
"......................................."
"It\'s not like human lives have different weights.
 Whether it\'s a baby or an old person, they\'re all just as precious...!"
"......But still, the longer the life they had in front of them,
 ...the longer the future you\'d have built together, ............the sadder their death is......!!"
"Aniki, you were engaged to Shannon‐chan, weren\'t you?
 You promised that you\'d build a life and a home together in the future, didn\'t you?!
 .........Compared to how huge that future was, ...compared to how huge that happiness was,
 ......my pain doesn\'t even come close...!!"
".........No one would blame you for crying so, so much more...!!
 And yet, ...just because you\'re like a big brother to us cousins,
 .........you force yourself to act like everything\'s all OK......!!"
"..................Stop it, ...Battler‐kun."
George was trying to make a calm smile.
......But.........he couldn\'t, any longer, stop a single hot tear from leaving a streak down his face.
"......How could I possibly...
......not be sad...?
 .........I think of Shannon, and all the futures we imagined together.
 We talked of so many dreams, the hundred years of our human lives would never have been enough to make them all come true."
"......Of those dreams,
 not even the very first one,
 ............having her move into my family register... We couldn\'t even have that...
......so how could I possibly...
.........not be sad.........?"
"Compared to that, I, ......I...!!
 Like I said, I have no right to cry any more!
 When even you\'re holding back, Aniki, what right do I have to shed any more tears?!"
"......We\'re the same.
 ...Both of us feel the exact same sadness from losing the ones we love.
 .........So there\'s nothing saying you don\'t have the right to cry compared to me."
".........And...
...there\'s nothing saying...I have to hold back my tears...any longer either."
"...Aniki, ......Anikii...!!!
 UOOOooooHhhhhOOoOhhhgghhh!!"
"Shannon and I always talked about our future together...and now she\'s dead.
 And my dad, he\'s dead too.
 .........It hurts, ......it really hurts...
 ......uuuuuhuuhuuhuuuuuuughhhuuughh!!"
As Battler and George tightly hugged each other, they cried a waterfall of tears over each other\'s shoulders for those people important to them...
"............Do you understand why I said that George‐aniki is the most in pain...?"
"I, ......I was listening, so I understand.
 ......The sadness is proportional to the length of time that would have been spent together in their lives after that..."
"......Of course, you can\'t calculate it just like that though.
 .........We Humans aren\'t like you witches.
 ......We have a finite time we\'re alive to the moment we die, and we live it with our utmost strength."
".........I can\'t forgive anyone who makes light of that.
 ......Never mind someone who sneers at it and toys with it.
 ...A person like you, whose very concept of death is all screwed up, probably can\'t understand that."
"......................................."
"......It isn\'t just the length of time we\'d live afterwards.
 ......Sneering at the lives of people living with all their strength...
 That\'s...what I can\'t forgive the most."
"George‐aniki has gone through his life hell‐bent on doing his best.
 ...He must have shown up today with heroic determination in order that he could marry Shannon‐chan.
 ......It\'s completely different from me, a guy who was just feeling happy to be able to meet his cousins again for the first time in ages."
"...B‐.........But still—"
"Beato.
 For now, stay silent and listen."
"............M‐...mm."
".........In a way, I do understand where you\'re coming from.
 ...You say that you need to continue murdering according to that weird epitaph for your own resurrection."
"......So if I keep the circumstances of your position in mind,
 ......I can just barely understand your murders.
 ......Because for you, that is a necessary action.
 ......In that case, all further unnecessary actions are your own meaningless cruel hobby."
"......In other words, if killing six people for the first twilight is a "necessary action" for you,
 ...all that show of crushing their faces and splitting their stomachs and stuffing them full of sweets is your own, completely unnecessary,
 preference for cruelty.
 .........I absolutely cannot forgive this aspect of you."
"........................m...mm......"
"When Auntie Rosa was repeatedly killed in horrible ways,
 ......you said, "she\'ll be brought back to life in the end, so it doesn\'t matter how she kills her",
 ...or something like that, I hear.
 VIRGILIA told me."
".........That was...
...well...
umm........."
"That idea that you can kill them as many times as you want, as long as you bring them back to life in the end,
 is a completely unnecessary action of toying with a life, isn\'t it?"
".........If you\'re going to kill them, get it over with!
 Don\'t toy with them!!
 If you aren\'t going to kill them, then don\'t tease them!!
 You\'re taking advantage of the fact that you can do as you will with people\'s lives, and you\'ve forgotten the sanctity of life.
 So I can\'t accept you...!"
"I definitely can\'t accept as my opponent a person who doesn\'t know the weight of a life, and the sadness when that life is lost!"
"...............That is why the Endless Magic is known as a black art.
 ...An Endless Witch has no concept of the finite.
 ......They have no concept of the finite, of the end that is implied by breaking and killing."
"...For that reason, Endless Witches sometimes treat the gap between life and death as if it was a Chinese jump rope,
 and start jumping back and forth over it."
".........That is a very, very frightening thing.
 That is why, as an Endless Witch, and out of my own desire,
 I never reached your level."
VIRGILIA had told Beato that countless times before.
But Beato had been too young to obediently listen to those words.
 She had been too wild.
 ...She had been possessed by that...detestable pleasure.
"......I had always been told not to break vases.
 ......But that\'s what made me want to break them someday."
".........Then, when I gained the Endless Magic,
 ...and I learned that I could fix it back to normal no matter how much I broke it,
 ......I was surprised at how fun it was to break a vase..."
"That is called the forbidden honey.
 People are not captivated by what\'s inside.
 They are captivated by the lock that seals it.
 .........It truly is deplorable."
".........I want to ask you, VIRGILIA.
 Why does this thing called the Endless Magic exist?
 ...For what purpose does it exist in this world?"
"It is not limited to the Endless Magic.
 ...All magic exists to bring happiness to the human world."
"......After everything that has happened, it may be difficult for you to believe, Battler‐kun, ......but we witches train in order to bring blessings to the human world,
 to become a bridge between humans and those who are not human."
"......How the hell does reviving the dead and torturing them to death over and over again help the human world?"
"When a vase that is an important memento is broken,
 if by fixing it everyone will regain their smiles, I would repair it with magic as many times as necessary.
 However, I would not be fixing it in order to break it again.
 ......I would be reviving it to give humans happiness."
"In that case,
 ............Beato.
 You fail as an Endless Witch."
"..............................h......mmm..."
"......There\'s something that\'s just come to me.
 .........Why do I keep going on with this strange game against you?"
"......Maybe this isn\'t a game to make me submit.
 ......Couldn\'t it be a test for you to be accepted as an Endless Witch, in its true meaning?"
"...I, .........I don\'t know about that.
 ...The reason I proposed this game to you was, umm, ......simply as a way to kill time...
 There was no one\'s ulterior motive."
"Just now, I heard the definition of a witch from VIRGILIA.
 By that definition, you, Beato,
 are not even a witch.
 You\'d be an apprentice who\'s in the middle of her training, and who misunderstands her own power."
"......This was supposedly a fight between a witch and a human.
 In that case, someone like you, who isn\'t a witch, is not qualified to be my opponent.
 .........Understand?"
"......I am still...
.........only an apprentice,
 ......you say......
 Then, when will I be accepted as your opponent once again?
 ......When can we resume this game?"
"..................Who knows.
 ...At the very least, it isn\'t now.
 ......When you fully understand what I\'ve said, and become a real witch,
 ...I will probably accept you as my opponent in this game once more."
"I, I can\'t understand if you say it so abstractly like that...
 Clearly tell me what I should do to earn your forgiveness..."
"No, I\'ve said enough.
 You think about the rest.
 .........I\'ve said everything I want to say.
 ...If you can\'t understand it, try talking with VIRGILIA and Ronove.
 ...A brat like you should start off by listening to what the adults say."
".........VIRGILIA.
 I will suspend the game for now.
 Now that Ronove has stepped down as representative,
 all we can do is wait for Beato to gain the qualifications of a proper opponent."
"......Understood.
 ......Until Beato has been accepted as having gained those qualifications, the game will proceed without an opponent.
 Is that alright with you too, Beato?"
"...I, ......I have no objections.
 .........I want time, and a place where I can think at a leisurely pace.
 ...May I take my leave now?"
".........Yeah, sure."
"...Well then, see you...later."
"Wait.
 ......Don\'t make that dejected face."
"........................Sorry about that.
 Letting everything inside my heart show up on my face is part of my personality.
 I cannot deceive."
"In that case, there\'s hope for you yet.
 .........Let me promise you one thing.
 In this game with you, I might win, and I might lose.
 ......It\'s also possible that it\'ll be a victory by default for me if you don\'t come back."
At that point, Battler stopped talking for a second.
...Then he spoke forcefully.
".........However, I definitely won\'t be the one to step down.
 I definitely won\'t give you a victory by default.
 ......I will keep on waiting here, for you to sit there again as my worthy opponent."
"......Battler‐sama..."
"...............Thank you,
 Battler.
 ...I will definitely come back and be accepted by you."
Beato showed him a very slightly hopeful smile, and disappeared.
...Looking at that expression, Battler strongly believed that her face could tell no lies...
The seven survivors returned to the guesthouse once again.
By now, it was clear that those who went outside would not be able to return alive.
Rudolf\'s group had gone out holding two guns and one master key.
 But those had been lost.
It was more than clear by now that they had been stolen by the culprit.
Since the windows were closed with the shutters, they wouldn\'t open even if the culprit had the master key.
They sealed the front door and all other doors to the outside with chains,
 and further blocked them with sofas and tables.
Even if the culprit decided to break in through violent means, it wouldn\'t be easy for them.
"......At this point, the typhoon may actually be fortunate.
 If it were clear outside, it might have been possible for them to set fire to the guesthouse."
"If there wasn\'t a typhoon in the first place, the boat would have arrived before noon.
 I\'m not sure you can call that a cloud\'s silver lining."
"......Eva‐san, how are you feeling physically?
 Please, try to take it easy."
"Thank you.
 ...I still have a temperature, but now isn\'t the time to be saying things like that.
 ......Now is not the time to be stuck in bed, for the children\'s sake as well."
After crying so much in front of Hideyoshi\'s body,
 Eva had now gained a strong self‐awareness that she was a mother, and her expression conveyed a strong will.
...Actually, her fever still hadn\'t gone down.
And she was aware of that.
 Whenever she wasn\'t galvanizing herself, she felt the fever starting to make her mind hazy again.
By this point, the first floor was a final line of defense made by Krauss, Natsuhi, and Eva.
The children and the guest, Nanjo, had been strongly warned not to carelessly come downstairs.
If the culprit used a ladder or something, it probably wouldn\'t be impossible for them to attack from upstairs.
But it wouldn\'t be easy for them to break those sturdy shutters from such an unstable position.
 It was comparatively safer upstairs compared to downstairs.
Battler and George had hoped to remain downstairs as well, to fight in the worst case scenario, but Eva had rejected that.
In her mind, George was now her only family.
It seemed that she didn\'t even want to expose him to the danger of coming downstairs to the first floor.
Krauss and Natsuhi could also understand that feeling.
......A great deal of time had now passed since they once again barricaded themselves in.
In the cousins\' room upstairs, Battler, George, and Jessica were sitting dazed,
 their ears not even registering the TV that had been left on.
For a while, Nanjo had been with them, and had tried to send them words to cheer them up,
 but when he realized that he might actually be having the opposite effect, he disappeared into his own upstairs room.
George kept looking dazedly at the photographs inserted in his notebook.
......They were from that time he had taken a vacation to Okinawa with Shannon.
Shannon\'s happy smile was contained in those photographs.
......George could remember the temperature and the humidity, the warmth and strength of the wind,
 and even what he had been talking about with her at the time those photos had been taken, as clearly as though it had been yesterday.
So to George, they weren\'t simply photos,
 but a door to bring back warm memories...
In this room, even though the sound of the typhoon and the TV should have entered George\'s hearing,
 ......it was the scenery of Okinawa he had seen with her, and her laughing voice, that reached his eyes and his ears...
After meeting Shannon, George had made the decision to be reborn.
He had sworn to separate himself from the timid person he had once been:
 easily caught up in the atmosphere, unable to refuse a request, and easily used by those around him.
......He had resolved himself to become a strong man who would make her life even more joyous.
So.
 ...If he hadn\'t met Shannon,
 ......the man called Ushiromiya George would probably have lived a very different life.
And the George of that different life surely wouldn\'t have been as excellent a man as he now was.
The way he was now, he was for the sake of Shannon.
 ......But if that same Shannon was now gone,
 ...he found himself wondering why he exists.
Isn\'t it completely meaningless?
...A deep, deep sadness, as though he himself had become empty.
That feeling had tormented him the whole time.
 ......However, until Battler had told him, he hadn\'t been aware of the feeling himself.
......He finally remembered...that he should have cried much, much more.
So he had cried.
 Just like Battler, he had cried himself dry.
......By now, his eyes were bright red and swollen, and he could not cry any more.
 So George did his best to change his way of thinking.
He decided to think that he was not meaningless, ...that he should be grateful to Shannon for giving him such a character.
Dead lives are not revived.
 He would have to get over being separated from his beloved.
If he were to come after Shannon by killing himself, she would surely be deeply dejected.
......It would be the same the other way around, too.
 If he died, and Shannon chased after him, throwing away her own life, he wouldn\'t be able to forgive himself.
......So he chose to surpass his emotions of sadness and anger,
 .........and decided to thank her.
Meeting Shannon had made his days rich and full,
 ...and had taught him the meaning of working hard for other people\'s sakes.
As a result, she had shaped him into the person he had wanted to be.
...He thought he should thank her for that.
By doing that, he tried to quell his sadness.
But each time he did, he remembered Shannon\'s smile...
.........He knew it, logically.
He understood that grieving any more than this would only make her grieve in heaven,
 ......yet he couldn\'t stop his sadness...
"Why...
......does people dying...
...make us this sad..."
Battler muttered.
...It was as though he was speaking on behalf of all humans.
He probably hadn\'t been asking anyone, but Jessica answered.
"......Partings are always sad, no matter what they\'re like."
"...But, when, for example, the person is old, or there\'s some time it\'s going to happen,
 ...when it\'s expected in advance, and you know it\'s a farewell that must come sooner or later,
 ...you can spend a long time softening the blow of that sadness.
 ......Sudden misfortune is probably sad...because you aren\'t allowed even that..."
"...............I see, yeah.
 ...Sure, if they get sick or something, and end up bedridden in a hospital for several years, you might be able to ready yourself for it bit by bit,
 ...but when it happens suddenly some day, you don\'t have that much time."
"...The sadness which you should normally spend several years softening closes in on you all at once.
 .........No wonder it\'s tough.
 ......Sometimes, it might even cause a sadness great enough to leave a scar for life..."
"......Enough to leave a scar for life, ...you say."
"......It\'s like Grandfather\'s occult hobby.
 That was what they whispered about it.
 ......That maybe BEATRICE was his lover, who died a long time ago, and he was so sad that he couldn\'t pull himself together."
"......And that\'s why he started sacrificing the rest of his life to research of the occult, in order to revive the dead.
 ......That\'s what they said."
"In that case, Grandfather succeeded in that miracle in his last moments.
 ......The culprit would be the revived BEATRICE, with Grandfather being reunited with her at the moment he was killed.
 ......Pretty ironic that he revived her, only then to be killed by her."
"............Even so, Grandfather was probably able to meet her.
 ...He gambled half of his life, and even though it was only for a short time,
 he was probably reunited with the woman he wished to see once again."
"...Except he got totally roasted.
 Probably wanted a bit more than that out of half a life\'s research."
"I wouldn\'t say that.
 .........Even if it was only for an instant,
 ......Grandfather must have been happy to be reunited with the woman he loved."
".........Even if his sin of defying life\'s providence was punished by God,
 and his body was burnt and sent down to hell,
 ...and even if the reunion he got in return only lasted a very short time..."
"George nii‐san......"
"......I wouldn\'t care if I met with the wrath of God and had my body burned.
 .........Even if it was just for a short amount of time,
 ......if I could revive Shannon again,
 ..................I would sacrifice the rest of my life to the same research as Grandfather."
"......Five minutes would be enough,
 ......I just want to talk with Shannon again...
 ......Even one minute would be fine......
 ......In exchange, ...I wouldn\'t mind......sacrificing the rest of my life......!"
".........Aniki......"
When Battler and Jessica realized that their pointless discussion was hurting George, they had no choice but to shut their mouths...
......George directed his thoughts at Kinzo\'s life:
I saw him sacrifice half of his life to research that no one could understand.
......And, on the last day of his life, he revived the person he loved most,
 ......and probably succeeded in his reunion in his final moments.
I don\'t know how much time they were able to spend together.
 ...I don\'t know whether they were given an hour, ...or just five minutes.
However, ......in that moment, all of that time he had sacrificed for his research must have been rewarded.
 ...Even though he spent decades to gain it, that small amount of time must have been enough to reward him.
Until today, I never believed in the occult or magic or anything.
Somewhere in my heart,
 ...I even made fun of Grandfather\'s research as nothing more than an indulgence.
However,
 ......I won\'t make fun of it anymore.
...No, to the contrary, I strongly believe that it does exist.
...If that power of belief can become miracles,
 I\'ll probably throw away all of my studies up until today,
 and spend the rest of my life from today onwards studying magic.
.........Give me the power of magic.
...And...a miracle which lets me meet Shannon again...
"....................................
 ......Haha, ...ha.
 ...Sorry, you two.
 I must be going mad.
 ......If you could revive the dead with magic,
 ......people would probably be studying it everywhere around the world."
"...But things like that don\'t exist in reality.
 No one studies it.
 .........That\'s because...they know...that the dead can\'t be brought back with magic."
"............Sorry for saying such weird things.
 It\'s my fault that the atmosphere here has gotten so strange.
 ...Sorry for making you worry about me, even though this is hard on everybody."
...Even though I did it to divert myself from my sadness, maybe I did say something strange.
If I keep talking about something so weird, I\'m sure it won\'t heal their sadness...
But, even so, ...that doesn\'t mean that I can withstand this silence.
"......I\'ll go downstairs, and get another cup of coffee.
 ......My mother is very particular about how to make a cup of coffee.
 Does anyone want a refill?"
Battler‐kun and Jessica‐chan lightly shook their heads.
Without being any more persistent than that, I took my mug and left the room.
I did visit Doctor Nanjo\'s room to ask whether he wanted any more coffee as well,
 but he too said that he didn\'t want any more.
......It seemed as though my mother\'s orthodox method of making coffee wasn\'t universally appreciated.
One time, I had Shannon drink some that I brewed by that method,
 ......but she told me that while it was delicious, it was a little strong,
 if I remember her words...
"............Shannon........."
It\'s no good...
 ......Even though I left the room to change my mood,
 ...that image of Shannon\'s face that\'s filling my head hasn\'t faded in the slightest...
The fun days I shared with her were becoming more and more vivid,
 ............and I felt saddened that I was not even allowed to see her dead face.
According to our parents, it seems as though she was killed with something like a gun or spear.
...I\'m sure they were just trying to console me, ......but they had said that her face in death had been very beautiful and peaceful.
I wonder if she\'s...wearing the engagement ring I gave her last night?
......If she accepted my engagement, she should have it on the ring finger of her left hand...
Last night, our heads were both full of each other, and we weren\'t composed at all.
Shannon had accepted the engagement semi‐boldly,
 but she might have regretted that as a rash action once she cooled her head.
 She might have taken the ring off.
......I wonder if she has the ring on now.
......I at least want to be sure of that much.
I want to know...her final feelings......
However, ......even if I do check that, ...it\'s not as if she\'ll be revived.
...............I wonder what will happen to her body.
After the autopsy, ......it will probably be immediately cremated.
Then, I\'ll never be able to see her face, ...even her dead face, for all eternity...
"..................
 .........Haha, ...because of the shock of losing Shannon,
 ......am I going a little crazy...?"
I don\'t want......Shannon\'s body to be burned.
If she\'s burned, she\'ll turn to ash, ......and never again will it be possible for her to revive.
They say that cremation is disliked in Western tradition.
......Because on the day of resurrection, there would be no body to revive.
Because of that, it seems that great criminals in Western history were often cremated after execution as a punishment,
 and their ashes were sometimes scattered in rivers and such...
In other words, to Western people, death is nothing more than a sleep until the resurrection.
 It is essential that the corpse is left after death.
"In other words,
 ......that\'s because Western people...
...knew of the existence of...
...a miracle to revive the dead.
 .........But that miracle didn\'t exist in Japan, so we burn them."
Now I understand.
 ...I understand why Grandfather idolized the Western occult.
From the beginning, it had all been only for that reason.
 ...Just to revive the person dear to him, ...Grandfather spent the rest of his remaining life researching the Western occult.
.........The situation surrounding us right now was abnormal.
Grandfather had revived his beloved BEATRICE.
...And that BEATRICE had carried out a terrible serial murder,
 with chains of locked rooms that were impossible without the use of magic.
......The Golden Witch, BEATRICE.
The incarnation of the miracle of the Western occult.
.........And also, the culprit who killed Shannon......
I should hate that being, ............and yet, for some reason, I want to cling to the hope she represents.
I wonder if she could use that miraculous magic that Grandfather spent his life espousing...to revive Shannon...
According to the Ushiromiya family legend, Grandfather met with her long ago, and was given a vast quantity of gold.
...Then if I also met her,
 ......instead of gold, would she give me Shannon\'s life?
In return, she could impose any kind of devil\'s contract.
For that, I would sacrifice all of my remaining life...
George probably couldn\'t have believed or noticed that, ...right behind him,
 ......the witch herself stood, listening to his voiceless wish.
BEATRICE had been listening to everything George and the others had to say since their discussion just now in the cousins\' room.
......Battler had told her that she didn\'t know the weight of a human\'s life,
 ......and wanting to understand that in her own way, she had stealthily visited, and listened to their discussion.
"........................
 ......You say that is your wish...?
 If I could grant that, would I be accepted as a witch...?"
Beato looked at the palms of both of her hands.
...She had handed over most of her previously surging magic power when the new witch had succeeded the name of Endless Witch.
Of course, even now her magic power still made her worthy of being called a witch,
 ...but it did not even compare to her previous strength.
"......Hmph.
 Even without the Endless Magic, I am a Great Witch whose name has thundered through a thousand years.
 Reviving the dead is no trouble at all."
Inside her head, she thought about several magical methods for reviving the dead.
......Even magic that she could do easily in the past would be difficult with her current magic power.
She thought of something, then clicked her tongue, and repeated this several times.
In the end, ......she finally thought of a single spell.
But that was a spell that she couldn\'t use by herself.
It was a spell that witches with weak power used, that relied on the aid of others.
...In the past, Beato had looked down upon that type of magic.
Therefore, she frantically tried to think if there wasn\'t any other possible spell,
 .........but in the end, she couldn\'t think of one, and slumped over in self‐derision.
And then, ......careful not to surprise him, she softly called out.
 Softly, to George\'s heart...
".........Ushiromiya George.
 ...Can you hear my voice...?"
"......I can hear.
 ......Who are you...?
 Are you really the witch, BEATRICE...?
 ...Or else, are you an illusion created by my sadness...?"
".........If it\'s the former, I want you to hear my wish.
 ...And if it\'s the latter, just leave me alone..."
Conversations in the world of the mind are a lot like those in a dream.
When you dream, haven\'t you ever had the experience...
of casually accepting something that would have been absurd in the real world?
......The conversation in this world was like that.
So even though a witch appeared and started talking to George, he was not surprised...
"Mm.
 ......I am...the Golden Witch, BEATRICE.
 .........Normally, you and I would not be able to talk together like this.
 ...However, you are strongly conscious of me, and wish to have a discussion,
 ...so both of our channels are able to match like this."
"...............The person who killed Shannon...
I don\'t care if it was you, or someone else taking on your name.
 ......As long as you exist as a real witch."
"............I would pay any compensation.
 ...If you desire my life, you can take it right now.
 ......Please, I want you to bring Shannon back to life...
 .........If that\'s impossible, then at least, I would like just to be allowed to talk to her for a short while......
 ......Please........."
".........I require no compensation.
 I shall grant that wish."
"...Really......?
 You\'ll really bring Shannon........."
"Mm.
 ......However, my current magic power is not sufficient to use resurrection magic.
 ...Therefore, I must rely on your help."
".........If there\'s something I can do, I\'ll do anything.
 ...Even if that means taking my heart out right here and now, I will not hesitate..."
"...I\'m telling you that I don\'t require something like that.
 ............I may cast the spell.
 Then, a gap would open in the door to Hades."
"...But as I am now, I do not have the power to bring Shannon\'s soul up through that gap.
 .........However, if it were you, who has strong feelings for Shannon,
 you should be able to change those feelings into magic, and bring her soul out without fail."
"......What do you say?
 Will you help me...?"
"...Of course I will.
 .........If Shannon\'s life will be revived,
 ......I am not afraid to lose everything......!"
George\'s fists shook in silence.
...Then he slowly regained consciousness.
He had been absentmindedly standing near the window in the hall the whole time, his mug still in his hand...
And......
............the witch from his dream......was still there.
"Wh‐......what the... .........I‐it isn\'t......a dream........."
"......Be quiet.
 I am very fragile now.
 If any more Humans appear now, I will not be able to preserve this form.
 ...I shall grant your wish, so stay silent for now.
 ...Is that alright?"
George covered his mouth with both hands, forcefully nodding several times.
As he did, he almost dropped the mug he was holding.
George frantically juggled it around and caught it.
...He was afraid that if it fell to the floor and made a loud sound,
 the witch\'s form might disappear like a bubble popping.
He softly set the mug on the floor, ...and stared once again at the witch in front of him.
.........Her form didn\'t disappear.
 It wasn\'t a dream......
"Come, let us go to the parlor where Shannon sleeps.
 With the power of your feelings, we will bring back her soul."
"Y‐you say go, but...how...?
 My mother and the others are downstairs.
 There\'s no way they\'d let me go outside.
 ......And, didn\'t you just say that you wouldn\'t be able to preserve your form if another Human appeared?"
"......Come to think of it, that is true.
 So, Krauss and the rest are downstairs.
 ...In that case, we definitely cannot go down.
 ......Well then, we just need to go to the mansion without going downstairs, right?
 It\'s simple."
Beato laughed, as though she had thought of a pleasant prank.
......And with her golden pipe, she lightly tapped a window with its shutter closed.
When she did, three gold butterflies appeared from the pipe and opened the lock on the window as though melting it.
Then the window opened without a sound.
The shutter beyond it was exactly the same.
The clasp unset itself, also without making a sound, and it quietly opened.
The window opened, exposing the wind and rain outside the mansion.
 ...Perhaps because of the direction or something related to the construction of the building, the wind did not blow inside.
Because of that, for a while,
 George felt as though this entrance opening to the outside was a dream or illusion, and he couldn\'t accept it as real.
"Come, let us go.
 Come with me."
Beato gently floated upwards.
 It was a natural action, like that of a diver enjoying an underwater stroll.
......It made it easy to believe that if you acted like she did,
 you too might be able to float in the sky just as though you were swimming in the water.
...No, George did believe that.
......So without thinking, just as she had done, he also...
...gently...
...as though swimming in the water...he moved his feet......
"......ah, ............aaaaaaahh........."
"Hoh.
 ...Not bad.
 So you learned how to dance through the sky faster than I could explain it."
George was shocked to find himself floating in midair like he was swimming.
...Of course, Beato was also shocked that George, who should have been unacquainted with magic, had learned how to do that just by instinct.
".........To be able to...
...fly in the air,
 ......swim in the air......"
"...You must not think of the logic.
 Accept it as a natural thing.
 ......You must not think back upon the Human doctrines, such as those from Newton and Einstein."
"Especially when flying high in the sky.
 ...Inexperienced witches sometimes fall."
"...I, ...I accept it as true...
 I accept it as true......"
George repeated those words over and over.
......He must not deny magic, no matter what.
To deny that would be the same as to throw away what might be...
his first and last chance to revive Shannon.
However, compared to Beato, who was elegantly drifting like smoke, George\'s movements were clearly similar to someone underwater.
...Therefore, if he didn\'t make a movement like kicking his feet in water every once in a while, he would be slowly dragged down by the force of gravity.
"I shall praise this as being a better performance than the first time I danced in the sky.
 ......Here we go.
 Come with me."
Beato beckoned to George, and gently flew into the stormy sky.
......It was just like a scene from a fairy tale.
The scene unfolding before George\'s eyes felt entirely like an extension of his dream.
"......Being able to fly is......incredible, ......but so is the wind and the rain..."
"What\'s this? Are the wind and rain tormenting you...?
 ......I could teach you magic to block against that,
 but it may be too early for you, and it may be a misuse of time right now."
"........................Yes.
 ...The magic I need...isn\'t that."
Without losing to the wind and rain, George wore a strong‐willed gaze.
"The mansion is coming into sight.
 ...Hold out just a little longer.
 If you fall now, you\'ll hit the bushes in the rose garden."
The undulating rose garden was spread beneath the witch and George\'s gazes.
This fantasy‐like scene no longer surprised George.
Only the gradually approaching mansion was reflected in his eyes.
"Shannon, .........wait for me...
 ......I will definitely...revive you......!"
Meanwhile...
......the cruel new witch could be seen staring at the guesthouse from a different location.
"...............Now, all that\'s left is the seventh and eighth twilights.
 Just two more, and my obligation to that predecessor hag is finished.
 .........I\'ll kill Krauss and Natsuhi.
 Together like a happy couple."
"Nihi.
 How are the targets nyeh?"
"......In the lobby on the first floor of the guesthouse, both targets and Ushiromiya Eva acquired.
 Measuring anti‐magic power.
 Data link to 410."
"410, data received.
 Anti‐magic power is extremely low.
 If Eva just goes outside, they\'re tuna and abalone on a chopping board.
 Nihihihihi...!"
"What would you ask of us, Great Lady BEATRICE?
 If you give the order, we will snipe right away...!
 Please, your orders...!"
"...You guys reaally are convenient furniture.
 Very different from old, second‐hand furniture, which only has enough talent to gouge corpses.
 Right?"
"..............................kh..."
"Chiester Sisters, please show me your skill again.
 ...Prepare to attack!
 *giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*!
 Carry the corpses out again, alright?
 \'Cause I\'ll play with them a lot.
 No complaints, OK, Ronove?"
"......Yes.
 Certainly."
"Nn......"
At that time, the witch noticed something.
 ......As though some presence had disappeared...
 ...Was it her imagination......?
".........Did you feel some kind of presence just now?
 Did any of you feel it?"
"M‐...my apologies, I didn\'t notice anything... Please forgive me......!!"
"We were in the middle of observing the guesthouse, so our peripheral surveillance was turned off. Nihi.
 ...What about you, Lucifer‐chaaan?
 Did you feel a presence?"
".........nh—"
For just an instant, Lucifer sent a glance at Ronove, questioning whether she should answer honestly or not.
Ronove gave a small nod in response.
"No.
 ...My apologies, BEATRICE‐sama.
 Nothing from us.
 .........Forgive us for this stupidity, as we are only second‐hand furniture."
"..........................."
"..........................."
"...........................
 ......I see.
 If a Great Demon like you says that, then it must have been my imagination."
The witch stared persistently in the direction the presence had disappeared to.
......That was the direction of the rose garden.
 And beyond that, she could see the mansion\'s dark silhouette created by lightning.
......It took her quite some time before she pushed her unsatisfied feelings aside,
 and once again turned to face the guesthouse.
