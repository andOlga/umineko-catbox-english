"........................"
"............This form is......"
"I\'m lending it to you.
 After all, I hate idiots.
 ......*giggle*giggle*.
 Call yourself Clair, as a temporary name.
 Or would you prefer Beato?"
"........................
 ...You have my gratitude.
 This way, I won\'t have to expose my pitiful form."
{f:5:Bernkastel} had given this person a fake form.
It was a temporary form for the person acting the part of {f:5:Beatrice}.
{n}A false appearance intended for those yet to reach the truth of {f:5:Beatrice}\'s identity......
"......Is that...
...a story about...
...me in another world?"
"Lion.
 ......It is a tale about me, who is also another world\'s you.
 ......The tale of the world where I live as a witch, not a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}..."
"............I sometimes imagine "what if" scenarios for my own life.
 ......However,
 ......the tale you tell...
...is beyond anything...
I can imagine..."
"Even so,
 ......it\'s the life that another "you" has led."
"But still!
 That doesn\'t mean I can accept it easily."
Lion suddenly yelled and looked at the floor.
{n}Lion already knew.
Because of the fragments provided by {f:5:Bernkastel}, Lion knew.
This was a different world, where the same person lived as the Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice}.
And, in this world, .........eventually,
 ............on the day of the October 1986 family conference,
 .........this person would be the ringleader of a terrible crime.
"......Even if it is a different world,
 ......you\'re saying that I get my immediate and extended family and all of the servants involved in a terrible crime that I\'m the mastermind of!
 How am I supposed to deal with that?!"
"...............Be quiet, listen, and understand."
"In a different life, I end up as a servant!
 And if that wasn\'t enough, I suddenly become a witch!
 And then, I eventually carry out several horrifying murders...!
 How am I supposed to "understand" that?!"
".............................."
"Yeah, that\'s what I expected you to say.
 ......I doubt anyone could understand.
 ......This person here\'s long past expecting anyone to understand.
 That\'s why {i:you} are here.
 ......That\'s why {f:5:Bernkastel} brought you two, two people who never could have met, together like this."
"............It\'s not like I had any deep reason for it.
 It was just a whim."
"It\'s a motive that no one else can understand, Lion, so you need to be the one to understand it.
 I\'m not the main character in this tale.
 You are.
 .........I\'m just here to help you understand."
"You said that you understood the culprit\'s motive."
"......Yeah."
"Is it...a satisfying motive...
for explaining why I\'d kill my entire family...?!"
"Who knows.
 That\'s for you to decide.
 Even if I say it\'s satisfying, that doesn\'t mean it\'ll satisfy you.
 ......You have to decide that for yourself."
"I really don\'t have a clue what\'s going on...!
 I\'ve seen several crimes called game boards that {f:5:Beatrice} supposedly carried out.
 And now, I\'m hearing another me talk about a different life from mine.
 But none of that fits with the crime!
 I don\'t understand!!"
"..................At this point in the tale, ......even I...
could not have dreamed that I would eventually carry out such a terrible crime.
 In fact, even if I could have dreamed it,
 .........I did not have the power to commit that crime at that time."
"Probably.
 ......Your misfortune probably came...
...when you solved the epitaph\'s riddle."
".........Huh?
 You mean that epitaph about the hidden gold, which Grandfather supposedly wrote...?!"
"There was a system by which the culprit obtained different accomplices each time the crime was committed.
 .........Reasoning leads us to the possibility that the culprit possessed a vast amount of money.
 And...
......for inviting all to the Golden Land...
......and making all loves bear fruit......there was one other system."
"...............So, it\'s not just the motive...
...that you\'ve figured out."
"That\'s the answer to the final riddle in the fourth game.
 ......Your greatest misfortune was solving the epitaph,
 .........reviving as the Golden Witch in the truest sense, and gaining that magical power."
"......Looking back, ......perhaps that was an ill‐fortuned event.
 .........I do not know.
 However, as long as the fact that Battler‐san returns in 1986 remains unchanged,
 .........some sort of tragedy would certainly have occurred."
"That\'s right.
 ......If Battler had returned a year earlier or later,
 .........that incident might not have occurred."
No, some small incident would probably have occurred.
And it would surely have been a mysterious, impossible incident, which no one could understand.
But even so, it would have been insignificant compared to the Rokkenjima Serial Murders......
"......If Battler‐kun...
...had returned a year earlier or later,
 ......then what?"
"........................
 ......Fate can be so filled with irony.
 .........It made me walk the path of a witch, ......and when I solved the epitaph, I became a true witch.
 ......Then, after six years, I learned of his return.
 .........If all of that was fate,
 .........then this crime must have been inevitable and inescapable for me."
"In 1980,
 when Asumu, his mother, died, and his father remarried too soon for his liking, Battler left the Ushiromiya family in disgust.
 And he was gone for six whole years."
He convinced his grandparents on his mother\'s side to help him and had his last name changed to his mother\'s maiden name.
Then, when those grandparents passed away, he finally made up with Rudolf...and returned to the Ushiromiya family again in 1986...
"That bad luck......gave birth to your motive for the crime."
".........I did think it.
 ......‘Why, after six whole years,
 .........have you come back now?’"
"I understand.
 In a way, ......it would have been better for you if he had never come back."
"Of course, my suffering would have continued.
 ......However, I may have avoided tainting myself with the unforgivable crime of mass murder."
".........How could Battler‐kun leaving the Ushiromiya family...
...create a motive?"
"You\'ve got it backwards."
"......Backwards?"
"The crime didn\'t occur because Battler left.
 .........It happened because Battler came back."
"...........................
 ......The more I think about it, the more I realize.
 ......Ushiromiya Battler.
 ......What a detestable man he was.
 More than anything else, because he never realized that the outbreak of the crime was his fault."
"He did remember, in the end.
 ......However, that was long after you gave up and disappeared."
"............If that is so,
 ......then it would give my heart some peace..."
"I still don\'t have a clue what you two are talking about.
 ......But I\'d like to ask you straightforwardly.
 I want to know.
 ......What on Earth happened to you that made you decide to commit the crime?"
"Yes.
 That\'s the most important part.
 ......Just like how Ushiromiya Battler respected the whydunit in mystery novels.
 .........In the tale of the Golden Witch and in the game, ......the answers to all the riddles are hidden there."
"In that case,
 .........allow me to continue.
 ......1980.
 ......Six years before I resolved myself to commit the crime."
"......Battler‐sama has...
......left the Ushiromiya family......?"
"That\'s what Krauss‐sama and Rudolf‐sama were saying!
 What a shock!"
"You have your own way of life and your own family situation.
 I have no intention of criticizing those.
 However, Father is in a towering rage.
 Disinheriting a son is one thing, but I\'ve never even heard of a child becoming so fed up with his family that he changed his own name."
"......No idea who he gets it from,
 but that Battler\'s as stubborn as a mule."
"If you are unable to understand Battler‐kun\'s feelings, I believe that would make you a failure as a father."
"That\'s enough.
 I\'m sure Rudolf was just trying to show his commitment to raising Kyrie‐san\'s child properly."
"That would be perfectly satisfactory if it happened next year.
 ......But why this year?
 He\'s still in a period of mourning.
 ......If you consider the timing of this pregnancy, one must acknowledge that Rudolf‐san has acted disgracefully."
"............Come on, don\'t be so harsh.
 ......This is my way of atoning for what I\'ve done..."
"Battler‐kun feels as though he\'s resisting you for the sake of his departed mother, Asumu‐san.
 ......I deeply understand how he feels.
 If he were here, I would like to hold him and cry along with him."
Natsuhi\'s words were sharp.
 They pierced Rudolf mercilessly.
Rudolf had no retort.
{n}His relationship with Kyrie had been improper, plain and simple.
......According to Rudolf, he had been close to Kyrie longer than Asumu.
And, even after his marriage to Asumu, that relationship had not disappeared......
What the hell?!
 You old bastard!!
So what you\'re telling me is, you\'ve been betraying Mom all this time!!
Sure, I know Kyrie‐san.
 You\'ve told me that she was your business partner and a friend whose advice you can always rely on!
Now you\'re telling me she was more than that all along, and you think I give a damn about that now?!!
If all this had happened after Mom died, that\'d be your own damn business!
 I\'d be right there with you, saying that you should live life as you please!
But just when did Kyrie‐san get pregnant?!
 Back when Mom was still alive, right?!
Yeah, now I finally get it!
 This is why looking at you makes me feel sick to my stomach!
You were {i:glad} when Mom died, weren\'t you? Weren\'t you?!
It must have been so hard on you, keeping your infidelity and even a kid secret while Mom was still alive!!
And now that Mom conveniently kicked it, you get to marry Kyrie‐san and make the kid my new little brother or sister... The nerve of you!!
Mom is crying her eyes out in heaven!!
 You should be ashamed of yourself, you should be ashamed!!
 {i:I} am!!
 I am goddamn ashamed to have the same last name as you!!
 The kid\'s done nothing wrong.
 He or she\'ll need two parents to look after him or her.
 So you go ahead and build a new family and give that kid a happy life!!
But don\'t expect any forgiveness from me!!
\'Cause Mom isn\'t even here to hate you anymore!!
 So I\'m gonna hate you in her place!!
 With all of my body and soul!!
 So long, you old bastard!!
"................................."
"That is enough, Natsuhi.
 ......Rudolf hasn\'t lost the affection he feels for Battler‐kun.
 ......It may take some time, but he wants to fix their relationship one day."
"No less should be expected of him as a father.
 ......Battler‐kun is not a stranger.
 He is Rudolf‐san\'s flesh and blood, and Rudolf‐san has a bounden duty to repair their relationship."
".........Go ahead.
 Heap it on me.
 I won\'t argue back.
 ......That\'s the only way I can atone."
"At the very least, make sure you give the new child a happy life."
"............The new kid......and Battler.
 ......They\'re both my kids."
"Wedding Kyrie‐san after Asumu‐san\'s death...
...may have been painful for Battler‐kun, but it was the best choice you could make for the coming child.
 ......I understand why you did it."
"And I understand why Battler‐kun felt like accusing you of being glad when Asumu‐san passed away."
"Stop, Natsuhi.
 ......Rudolf has already been scolded enough from the person most fit to do so."
"......Now then, how about some black tea?
 Would you mind asking someone in the kitchen to make us some?"
"...............Very well."
Natsuhi took this as a signal to leave the room and did so.
Once she left, Krauss relaxed slightly.
"............It is a terrible shame about Asumu‐san,
 ......but considering the best interests of the coming child, the timing of all this might have been fortuitous."
"It\'s almost as though Asumu...
...knew about it, and stepped down from the stage of her own choosing.
 .........Was I the one who killed her...?
 .........If so, ......how long ago did I start...?"
"If you still treasure Asumu‐san\'s memory,
 ......then, though it may take several years, you must fix your relationship with Battler‐kun."
".........Yeah.
 ......I know."
"And be sure to pour just as much affection on Kyrie‐san and the new child that is to be born.
 ......While also bearing Asumu‐san\'s cross."
"..............................
 .........If they have reserved seating in hell..."
"......Hmm?"
"I hope that one of their finest seats...
...has got my name on it......"
"..........................."
The news that Battler had left the Ushiromiya family swept across the family.
"How terrible for Battler‐san, too......
 I do believe that they will make up eventually, but......"
"......This is a matter for the family.
 We servants have nothing to do with it.
 Instead, we should focus on memorizing the face of the newest member of the Ushiromiya family, Kyrie‐sama."
"Yes, that\'s true.
 She will be coming to the family conference this year......"
If the person new to the Ushiromiya family would be coming to the conference...
......Then what about the person who just left...?
"That means Battler isn\'t coming, right?"
"That seems the most probable outcome.
 How lonely is the loss of a single, noisy man."
Though most people felt that it was sad to see Battler leave the Ushiromiya family and that he would be missed, they didn\'t think any more about it than that.
However, .........what about Shannon?
Wasn\'t Battler supposed to come for her on a white horse......?
At first, I was shocked.
Because I immediately thought that his departure from the family meant that he wouldn\'t be coming to this island anymore.
......And I do think that\'s understandable given how he must feel.
I understand painfully well why he wanted to leave his family...
But, ......does that really mean he won\'t come to Rokkenjima anymore...?
What on Earth is going on?
{n}Will he really never return?
Unable to ask him this directly, I was forced to spend each day contending with a growing sense of anxiety...
 ......Battler‐san.
{n}I understand how you feel......
But............
.........You wouldn\'t leave this place behind forever just because you broke away from the Ushiromiya family, would you...?
 ......Tell me it isn\'t true......
I was so confused that the world seemed to be spinning around me...
I felt tightness in my chest, and I couldn\'t think at all.
When I happened to touch my cheek,
 ......I was surprised to find it hot and wet.
......With a miserable expression on my face,
 I was...
...crying......
{a:c:
Shannon......
...Shannon.........}
From far away, ......I could hear someone calling to me.
{n}But it was a very strange sort of distance.
Though it felt very far away, ......the voice also seemed to be coming from right beside me.
"......Shannon.
 I understand......how you must be feeling..."
"It\'s okay.
 ......It\'s just a fight between a boy and his father.
 And rumors always blow things out of proportion.
 Everything\'s just being exaggerated."
"Indeed.
 There are none who can say with certainty that Battler will not return to this island.
 You would do well to remain strong."
......Where......is this place......?
I seem to remember it somehow.
It\'s like it reminds me of the scenery of a strange dream I once had.
{n}......Then, ......this must be another dream......
I was there, under an arbor in a golden rose garden,
 ......and two witches in white and red dresses were showering words of encouragement upon me...
"You can be sure that those rumor‐mongering young servants are embellishing the story however they please.
 That he has {i:changed his name} is obviously a gross exaggeration!
 Surely, this can be nothing more than a family quarrel."
"........................
 ......Thank you.
 ......I wish I could believe that..."
"Of course that\'s true.
 He\'s a boy, after all.
 You can hardly be surprised that he has a few arguments with his dad."
"Precisely, as you say.
 Clearly, they will make it up to each other once they cool their heads."
"Arguments between men flare up quickly, but they burn out just as fast."
"In contrast, an argument between women never bursts into flame, but smolders and lasts forever.
 Men\'s arguments are fierce but short!
 Quick and easy."
"......You\'re right.
 ......I hope Battler‐san and Rudolf‐sama...
...make up soon..."
"Oh, they will!
 Haven\'t you heard all the times Battler has spoken of it?
 He always fights with his father!
 This is just another of those fights.
 His mother\'s death and his father\'s remarriage have upset him—that is all."
"It sounds as though he\'s gone to live with his mother\'s parents, but he\'ll come back after he\'s had a few days to cool his head.
 You know, like a kid running away from home."
The two witches kept saying that Battler\'s fight hadn\'t been anything huge.
......If it was just a family quarrel, the rumors wouldn\'t have started in the first place.
 I just can\'t feel optimistic about this...
"In any case,
 this is a problem between Battler and his father.
 Have patience, and time will heal all wounds!
 Matters will not be helped by you worrying about it."
"Just because Battler didn\'t come today doesn\'t mean we can be sure he\'ll never come.
 All this means is that Rudolf came alone today."
"Very true.
 Of course he will appear at the next family conference, as energetic as ever!
 By then, Rudolf will probably bring that Kyrie here too.
 Battler may be sulky about it, but I am certain that he will come too!"
"......You\'re right.
 ......Yeah.
 .........I\'m sure...you\'re right."
How nice would it be if they were right...
In fact, if I could, I\'d like to flip through the calendar until autumn right now and check to see whether he does come to the next conference.
If he does, then all of my fears are groundless.
It would mean the rumor‐mongering family members and servants just blew things out of proportion......
If Battler‐san were right here, I\'d like to question him right away...
 "Hey, it isn\'t true that you\'ll never come to Rokkenjima again, right...?"
If I could just hear him say "of course not", ......I could stop worrying about it...
I don\'t know the phone number for Rudolf‐sama\'s house, but I could probably look it up if I tried.
However, as a servant of the family, I have no excuse for making the call.
And anyway, I have no way of finding out the phone number at Battler‐san\'s grandparents\' house......
All I can do is wait for Rudolf‐sama\'s family to come visit and hope that my fears are groundless......
However, will I be able to make it through the day feeling like this...?
No way.
 I doubt I\'ll sleep a wink tonight.
Just waiting around, feeling like this, ......when I don\'t know when my next chance will come...
 I can\'t do that...
Will it be next month?
 Or the month after?
{n}......In the worst case, I might have to wait until the next family conference.
And I have to wait that long......while holding back this suffocating feeling......
......I can\'t bear it.........
"Hey, Shannon.
 Sorry for asking this out of the blue,
 ......but when you said that by the next year you\'d have made a resolved decision about something, that something wasn\'t just quitting work as a servant on this island, right?"
"......Huh? ......Well, I.........
 ........................"
It was......to make up my mind to start a new life.
Instead of remaining a servant by force of habit.
I\'m supposed to resolve to step into a new life and leave my old life as a servant behind.
"And Battler promised that he\'d come here on the day you make that resolved decision, right...?"
".........Ummm,
 .........yes..."
"Tact is not one of my strong points, so I shall speak frankly.
 You are supposed to resolve to start a new life with Battler, correct...?"
"......A new life...
...with...Battler‐san..."
"You are afraid that Battler will not come for you on the day of your decision.
 However, there is more to that day of decision than just Battler coming to see you."
"It\'s also the day for you to show your resolve to spend the rest of your life with Battler."
"That resolve is yours to create.
 It is not something that will be created automatically upon Battler\'s visit."
"......Shannon.
 Are you already resolved to spend the rest of your life with him?
 You decided to put it off until the next family conference because you didn\'t have that resolve the last time, right?"
"What does it mean to live life with Battler?
 Have you ever thought seriously about it in detail?"
"Well, .........uh............"
As long as I\'m working as a servant on Rokkenjima, my opportunities for meeting him are limited.
We\'re both underage, so it\'s too early to talk about......umm......marriage.
However, if I quit working as a servant, I should have many more opportunities to meet him.
Once I quit work here, ......I\'ll return to the Gospel House.
I have my wages for serving the family, so I should have more than enough to make visits to Battler‐san\'s house.
And when I graduate from school, I can rent an apartment near to Battler‐san\'s house.
Then, well......I can work while going to school.
{n}That life will be a lot more difficult than my vague conception of it.
......However, I\'ll be able to see Battler‐san much, much more often.
{n}If not every day, then every week.
I won\'t be a servant anymore, so we\'ll finally be equals.
 ......I\'ll be allowed to call him whenever I want.
And I\'m already balancing school and work.
Thanks to my experience here, I know more than enough to do simple housework......
"......Doesn\'t that sound like a fun life?
 You can rent a humble abode, and once you\'ve built up your own home, you can invite Battler over."
"And then, the time you spend together, the world the two of you make, will begin.
 Doesn\'t that sound wonderful?"
".........Y‐
......yes.
 ......It does sound a bit...
...wonderful......"
This was the first time I had ever imagined that future clearly.
I\'ve been able to appreciate the feeling of my love for him...
......and my honest desire to live my life with him.
However, now that I have a clear picture of the future I plan to choose, I finally understand.
I need to mentally commit myself to embarking on this future.
"You dream of...
......marriage, eventually, don\'t you?"
"Hohoh!
 Girls these days, dating with marriage in mind at such a young age...!"
"W‐well, that\'s a bit, umm......"
"Don\'t deny your dreams, okay?
 There\'s no point in taking a first step if your eyes are closed and you don\'t look to the future."
"If a girl\'s in love with a man, there\'s nothing wrong with thinking "I wanna marry hi~m"!
 That\'s a young girl\'s natural right."
My face had turned bright red.
Before today, I had thought that considering marriage really was a bit premature, and I had been trying my best not to think about it.
......However, now that the witches had encouraged me to imagine it, that image was both exciting and fresh.
I felt an indescribable feeling of refreshment and awakening,
 ......like the gentle breeze that washes over you when you go outside during a brief spot of sunshine on a rainy day.
Certainly, I hadn\'t yet reached that level of resolve.
I need to create that resolve by the time the next family conference comes around.
If I can\'t do that, then sticking around as a servant on this island is no more than I deserve.
"And at the same time, this is also a trial."
"True.
 A trial to be overcome."
"......A trial...?
 Why is that...?"
"Fool.
 Battler promised that he would come for you at the next family conference, did he not?"
"He said he\'d come on a white horse, right?"
"Y‐......yes......"
"You are thinking that Battler will not come anymore.
 In other words, you have no trust in Battler\'s promise."
"That\'s why this is a trial.
 To pass through this trial, you\'ll have to show that you can trust him and wait."
".........A trial......"
I never thought of it that way.
Since he promised to come for me in a year...
{n}I must believe that he will come for me in a year.
......If I doubt that, I don\'t have the right to wait for him in the first place.
..............................
"In fact, the reason that Battler left the Ushiromiya family might have been...
that he has his sights set on a future with you."
"Oh, why would that be?"
"If he knows that you will live together and eventually exchange marriage vows,
 having the name Ushiromiya could cause problems, since Shannon is a servant of the Ushiromiya family."
"Ah, I see!
 He realizes that there\'ll be all kinds of trouble if he decides to marry a servant girl, so he\'s abandoned the Ushiromiya name beforehand...!"
"What do you think, Shannon?!
 That way, everything makes sense!
 Battler has abandoned the Ushiromiya name for your sake!
 This sudden argument with Rudolf was undoubtedly just an excuse."
"What splendid reasoning!
 Nice going, Riiche!"
"Wahahahahahahahahaha...!
 What do you say, Shannon?
 There\'s no reason to feel down!
 On the contrary, it is as though Battler has shown his resolve first!"
"......*giggle*.
 ......*giggle*giggle*giggle*......"
A smile finally returned to my face.
{n}Of course, I hadn\'t taken the witches seriously and let myself be reassured.
The opposite, in fact.
 It was just funny that they could think up such ridiculously convenient explanations for everything.
However, they had made all of those ridiculous theories to cheer me up.
......The witches are right when they say that I must trust Battler‐san...
and that there\'s no point moping about just because I\'ve heard a few rumors.
By the date of the next family conference, I intend to have a firm resolve to live my life with him.
And......I believe that he\'ll accept my feelings and come for me.
The idea that Battler left the family so that he could be married to me some day...
......is laughable, of course.
But right now, I should try to feel confident enough to accept even crazy ideas like that.
"............Thanks so much.
 ......I feel a little better now."
"That is well.
 I cannot stand watching you dampen your pillow with tears."
"Thanks for coming into my dreams to encourage me."
"Yes.
 ......It will be morning soon.
 This is all a dream.
 You will surely have forgotten it when you wake up.
 However, your heart will be at peace."
".........Yes.
 ......I\'ll believe in him...and wait.
 ......So, I won\'t listen to every little rumor."
"Very good.
 Wait until the next conference while improving yourself.
 If you think of it as training to become a wife, all of your everyday chores will grow more meaningful!"
"*giggle*.
 ......Thanks a lot."
"......Riiche.
 It\'ll be morning soon."
"Is that so?
 Then so long, Shannon.
 ......You may not remember me,
 but I will always be by your side, watching over you......"
"Thank you......
 ......Thank you..."
"......The next family conference will be here in a flash.
 ......Wait for it at your leisure......
 Battler will certainly keep his promise........."
"Pleased to meet you.
 .........My name is Kyrie.
 I hope we can all become quick friends."
"I\'ve known your name longer than I\'ve known Asumu‐san\'s.
 I hear you\'re Rudolf\'s old girlfriend."
"*giggle*.
 Yes, we\'ve known each other for quite a long time..."
"......Welcome to the Ushiromiya family.
 I hope you find it easy to grow comfortable here."
"Yes.
 I\'d like to grow comfortable quickly, so that I can support my husband."
"But look at how cute that little girl is.
 What\'s her name...?!"
"This is Ange‐chan.
 What a cute name."
"............So, you two couldn\'t make up after all."
"I thought this would be the perfect chance to bring him back, but...
 ......He\'s as stubborn as Dad."
"Will Battler‐kun ever come back...?
 I\'ll miss him."
"Nothin\' wrong with a man havin\' the backbone to find his own way in the world.
 I\'m sure he\'ll make it big and come right back...!"
"You think so?
 Right now, Battler‐kun\'s home isn\'t home for him.
 There\'s no reason for him to go back there."
"......Enough.
 This concerns Rudolf\'s family only.
 It is not our place to meddle."
"Thank you, Krauss nii‐san.
 ......This is an issue for our family alone.
 However, I intend to do all I can to see that Battler‐kun and Rudolf‐san can live together again someday.
 After all, he\'s Ange\'s one and only big brother."
"......Yep.
 When that kid gets stuck on something, anything you say to him will have the opposite effect.
 ......Asumu\'s father has a bit of a short temper.
 Looks like he\'s been adding fuel to the fire."
"It\'ll be okay.
 I\'m sure he\'ll understand your feelings before too long."
"We can\'t do anything except cheer you on.
 ......Even if he doesn\'t come back, we\'re all prayin\' that the two of you will make up quickly."
"......It\'s kinda boring without Battler."
"Yeah.
 ......I hope he and Uncle Rudolf can make up soon."
"............If you think about how Battler‐sama feels......it must be painful."
"It\'s like his family\'s suddenly changed around him...
 ......It probably doesn\'t feel comfortable at home anymore."
"All men need to go out into the world one day or another.
 It might just be that Battler‐kun\'s time has come."
"Do you think so......?"
"I do.
 It\'s not cool for a guy to hang around at his parents\' for too long.
 You\'ve got to leave the nest in a flurry and make your name in the world.
 ......I planned to do that eventually, but it looks like he\'s gone and done it first."
"O‐once he makes his name in the world, ......do you think he will come back?"
"It may be......that he never comes back.
 After all, this might be leaving the nest to him."
"......Leaving the nest....................."
"Battler didn\'t come, did he......"
"Oh, how terrible.
 And I kept telling Shannon that he was sure to come.
 .........I\'m sure she feels very upset about Battler not coming.
 And it\'s all because I irresponsibly raised her hopes...!"
"She\'s practically been living for the sake of this day...
 It pains me to think of how she must feel."
"...............Thanks, you two.
 ......I\'m...okay."
I had been reunited with the witches once again in that dream world.
.........Though I could never remember anything during the day, now that I was in the dream world, I somehow knew that this was a reunion.
The witches both looked apologetic.
Though they had tried to cheer me up by saying that Battler would come today,
 now that he hadn\'t come, it was like they had been lying, and they seemed to regret it heavily.
"Shannon,
 ......umm...
...well......"
"......Thanks for your concern.
 It\'d be a lie to say I\'m not sad,
 .........but I\'ll be okay."
"Y‐you will?
 You are certain?
 ......That would be splendid, but......"
"Clearly, Battler\'s fight was so over‐the‐top that he couldn\'t bring himself to back down so soon.
 Men are so stubborn."
"Y‐yes, that is true...!
 He stormed out of the family with some very strong words, so his stubbornness is preventing him from taking back what he said so easily!
 He probably regrets not coming today.
 Yes, that must be it...!"
For some reason, ......they seemed nearly desperate in their attempts to encourage me.
It was almost funny to watch.
 ......I couldn\'t help but giggle.
"Thanks a lot, both of you.
 After all, .........you\'re the ones who told me in the first place.
 That this is a test, a trial to be overcome."
The truth was, I couldn\'t really fool myself so easily.
When will he come back?
{n}When will he come for me?
{n}When...isn\'t the question.
 ......Will he come for me, ever?
If I start moping right now, the uncertainty and sadness will probably tear me apart.
But they\'ve taught me.
This is.........a test to see whether I really have faith in him or not.
The very fact that I feel uncertain and anxious is a betrayal of my resolve......and of his promise to come for me someday.
"George‐sama said something about it.
 ......He said this might be the same as leaving the nest for Battler‐san."
"That\'s right.
 This is his chance to leave behind the Ushiromiya name and spread his wings as his own man."
"If you really think about it, ......we\'re still very young.
 Even if we want to be tied together, we\'re still lacking many years of social experience and trust.
 If Battler‐san is really and truly taking this seriously, ......then it\'s too soon for him to come for me now."
"Well done.
 Yes, that\'s the right attitude...!
 You have done well to reach this understanding."
"......I haven\'t reached anything...
 .........But I\'ve decided to think of it that way for now.
 This is a trial......to see whether I trust Battler‐san or not."
If he {i:had} showed up today,
 ......then today, I would have had to inform Madam that I was quitting my job as a servant.
But was I mentally prepared for that?
I spent all last night worrying about whether Battler‐san would come or not.
I spent so much time worrying that not only was I not mentally prepared to quit my job, I didn\'t even prepare a letter of resignation.
......In short, I still don\'t have the "resolve" that I promised him that day.
I\'m sure that God knew that.
{n}Battler is supposed to come for me when I\'ve found my resolve.
I wasn\'t resolved, so it\'s only natural that he didn\'t come today......
..............................
......Yeah.
 ...It all makes sense now.
"So,
 ......I\'m sure Battler‐san didn\'t come today......because I wasn\'t resolved enough.
 It\'s only natural, since I couldn\'t even truly believe that he would come..."
"I\'m sure Battler was the same way.
 He did not yet have the resolve to come for you."
"......God isn\'t heartless.
 When your feelings truly do draw close, I\'m sure He\'ll bring the two of you together."
"Just like {c:86EF9C:Orihime and Hikoboshi}...!"
"Yes, it\'s as though the weather just happened to be bad during this year\'s Tanabata...
 ......That\'s how I\'d like to think about what happened today."
That\'s how...I\'d like to think about it.
......I have no other choice.
..............................
......Battler‐san......
"But Battler‐kun didn\'t come back for......"
"Six years.
 ......Still a long way to go until then."
"......So this agonizing wait continued for six whole years...?"
"When one waits every year for something to happen the next, and then the same thing the next year and the next,
 ......it becomes similar to waiting for an eternity."
".........Pretty pathetic, don\'t you think?
 After all, this promise you thought Battler made seems to be something he wasn\'t even conscious of, right?"
"Battler‐kun does tend to use melodramatic phrases, just like Uncle Rudolf.
 ......His turns of phrase might have led to a misunderstanding..."
"Some girl\'s going to stab Battler in the back someday.
 ......Well, that\'s more or less what this tale is."
".........When words carry significance, they can change the course of a person\'s life.
 ......There are times...when careless talk can kill."
"...................................."
