"............Lambda, ......where are you......?"
Just having to say that felt like admitting defeat......and I didn\'t like it.
Why is it that she\'s always so obnoxious and clingy when I don\'t need her,
 ......and then won\'t answer when I call her name?
Where.........am I......?
Annoyed by the completely predictable ending, I had left the cathedral.
......I had planned on finding some terrace with a cool night\'s breeze...
where I could kill time until the end of that farcical reception.
"......It\'s true that I tried to find somewhere desolate so that I didn\'t have to look at people,
 .........but this is a bit ridiculous."
I, the great BERNKASTEL, ......am lost?
A miracle like that certainly couldn\'t happen.
Yes...miracles don\'t exist in this world.
To create a miracle, you need "an amount of time that can never be reached", a period that is no different from infinity.
So, when something that appears to be a miracle happens in a shorter span of time than that,
 .....it is not a miracle...
but due to someone\'s......design.
In other words, ......the reason I\'m walking down this bizarre corridor...
...is because someone\'s design has forced me here......
".........Who did this?
 Who pulled this elaborate prank on me?
 .........You must be quite the shy one,
 ......calling me out to a desolate place like this."
......Then, ......from the other end of the dark corridor, ......I heard a sound.
*patter*, *patter*patter*patter*.........
It sounded as though some small animal, like a dog or a cat, was walking at a quick pace.
No miracle could cause a dog or cat to be in a place like this.
Such a miracle would not be "allowed".
Since it isn\'t a miracle,
 that means I am being guided in that direction.
.........Alright then.
 This might be some new idea to keep me entertained.
If this is some new joke of Lambda\'s, I\'ll cover her whole body with honey using my tongue as a reward.
...And then, I\'ll stick parasol chocolates into her eyes and tell her to never do it again.
In the direction that the noise had come from, ......it was not only dim, but shrouded in complete darkness.
However, ......I could sense something in that darkness.
.........There were two emerald‐green glints, ......probably cat eyes.
 The eyes of a black cat that blended well into the darkness.
"Are you the one who called me here...?
 .........Or......are you just the messenger...? ..............."
When I looked at my feet, ......I saw red cat footprints leading towards those cat eyes.
......It was unsettling, ...as though it had run through a puddle of blood on its way there.
After my eyes adjusted to the darkness, .........even with the lack of light, I was vaguely able to make out the red footprints ahead of me.
......They weren\'t actually glowing or anything,
 ......but they served perfectly well as a signpost leading me onwards.
*patter*patter*patter*patter*......
As though it was telling me to follow,
 ......the cat turned around and dashed off into the darkness.
..................What is it?
 ......Something feels...very strange.
It\'s a feeling I haven\'t felt since I began calling myself the cruelest witch in the world.
......I can\'t quite remember what this feeling is.
Still, ......for one as tired of boredom as me, it\'s surely more fun this way.
I followed the bloody footprints of the cat, which would sometimes stop and look back at me,
 ............and walked on and on through the dark corridor......
It headed forward, .........turned corners,
 .........and descended what appeared to be stairs from time to time.
And then, ......though I couldn\'t really tell because of the darkness, .........it slipped through the crack of a door.
"........................Here......?"
I pushed the door open slowly, ......but it was dark on the inside, just like the corridor.
However, the air and the slight change in the echoes made by the footsteps...
told me that this was a room, not a corridor.
The sounds of the cat\'s footsteps were gone.
......However, the bloody footprints remained.
On the other side of some sort of wooden screen, ......under what looked like a small spotlight...
......that same black cat...
was noisily gobbling down a bowl of pet food.
.........I see.
 So, this is its reward for bringing me here...
"Cat......
 Sorry to bother you during your meal,
 ......but I\'d like you to summon your master.
 .........That is, unless you\'re actually the one who summoned me...?"
Talking to it didn\'t cause it to turn around.
......Well, I guess it is an animal eating its food.
 ......If I kick it away, it\'ll probably run off to its owner.
".........Hmph."
When I did kick the cat,
 ......it sailed away like a stuffed animal,
 hit the wall, and fell to the ground.
Then, it vanished, as though it had melted into the darkness......
......What\'s with this cat?
 ......Is it just an illusion...?
"........................!"
When I looked at its food bowl, ......it was piled up with what appeared to be blood‐drenched raw meat.
......It was as though someone had torn apart living flesh on the spot...
...and piled it into there.
".........Come on, what\'s with the creepy reception?"
――That was a mean thing to do, kicking it.
The instant I heard that voice, the hairs on the back of my neck stood on end.
Then, ......the surrounding area finally brightened.....
However, BERNKASTEL had already guessed where this was before it grew bright...
".........That was you.
 ......That cat."
"......................................."
"......My dear flesh‐eating cat who has learned to choose its own path,
 ......it has been long since we last met......"
"It\'s a path I\'d never have to have noticed if you hadn\'t told me.
 ......You\'re the monster who taught me the taste of flesh.
 .........So, you\'ve come back to life.
 .........FEATHERINE AUAURORA..."
"......It is AUGUSTUS AURORA......
 You never learn no matter how often I tell you that...
 ...Very well.
 Even that brings back fond memories......
 I have heard the rumors...
 .........It seems you have taken the name BERNKASTEL, Witch of Miracles, .........and have been traveling around playing some far from praiseworthy fragment games......"
"I\'m just imitating you.
 Though I could hardly match up to your level.
 ......If the rumors you\'ve heard about me are bad, that applies a hundredfold to you."
BERNKASTEL sat unreservedly in an antique chair,
 ......as though she was already familiar with the place.
"............What are you afraid of?
 I am merely celebrating my reunion with my longest‐serving miko so far...
 Did you really find my messenger cat so displeasing?"
By all appearances, BERNKASTEL\'s manner seemed relaxed...
However, FEATHERINE admonished her, telling her not to be afraid.
......And, judging by the expression that rose to Bern\'s face,
 ......FEATHERINE had been right on the mark...
"Did you really have to make such blunt insinuations against me?
 ......A cat leaving behind bloody footprints and stuffing its face with blood‐stained meat..."
"...........................
 ......Have no fear.
 ......Look closely.
 ......Where do you see a cat stuffing its face with blood‐stained meat......?
 I just gave it a plate of biscuits as a reward for going to get you..."
"..........................."
............Despite there being no wind, the bowl at her feet seemed to blow away as though it was made of soot.
...In its place lay a lovely......and perfectly normal......cat dish,
 .........with a pile of small biscuits on top of it...
".....................Tch......"
BERNKASTEL didn\'t even hide her displeased grimace.
FEATHERINE shrugged and muttered "you haven\'t changed, child of man" as she rocked her rocking chair.
".........I see you\'re as unpleasant as ever.
 ......But nowadays I find you pleasing.
 Imitating you really has been far from boring."
"......Scold me as you please.
 It is the parting gift I gave you when we last met."
"You liked abusive mikos because they kept you entertained, right......?
 Tch, ridiculous.
 ......If talking will only please you, I\'ll shut up.
 .........So, ......what do you want with me...?"
"It seems BEATRICE\'s game has ended with Battler\'s victory.
 ......I observed it.
 It was quite entertaining."
".........I\'m sure you enjoyed seeing me fail miserably."
"Nonsense, it was a splendid performance...
 ............I\'m sure Beato is very grateful to you."
"............Hmph.
 ......And?
 If you want me to read the fragments of Beato\'s game aloud for you, I refuse.
 I\'m not your miko anymore."
"I have observed all of Beato\'s games.
 ......I also watched LAMBDADELTA\'s game and Battler\'s game with great interest.
 ......I believe I have fashioned my own particular answers to all the mysteries.
 .........The culprit.
 The motive.
 The individual tricks.
 ......I am not yet clear about the very last part of the epitaph\'s riddle,
 but I have enough of a theory that if I actually went to Rokkenjima and investigated, I should be able to resolve that part as well."
"...............And...?"
"Of course, since there is no single truth, my theory is probably only one of many possibilities.
 ......However, it is one of those possibilities, so that problem is a trivial one."
"......What are you up to?
 .........Do you want to debate Beato\'s game with me?"
"Wrong.
 .........What I want is to look at the answers, child of man."
Those words of FEATHERINE\'s made BERNKASTEL straighten up.
......Her old master did not fail to notice that small reaction.
"So far, you have spiced up this tale as an actor.
 In doing that, you have probably come to know many truths.
 ......However, even you are unaware of the truth behind several mysteries that Beato has skillfully kept hidden, correct......?"
"...........................
 .........I see...
 .........You want to use me......to chew apart......and string out the guts of something again."
"After watching a play, the experience of reading the pamphlet and learning what goes on behind the scenes...
...is similar to, as you would say it, enjoying some black tea after a meal.
 ......It is ceremony, but essential nonetheless."
"You play with them and love them while they\'re alive, then eat their flesh when they die.
 ......So, cats are doubly useful to you.
 .........Just die, monster."
"I want...to look at the answers.
 .........I\'m sure you want to know them."
"...................................."
"Think of it as a burial for Beato\'s corpse, where you are in charge of the service.
 ......What do you say about that, child of man?"
".........Now, you\'re starting to speak my language."
When FEATHERINE snapped her fingers,
 a thin spotlight shone on a table cluttered with books.
There.........lay a folded version of the game board for Beato\'s game.
The Witch of Theatergoing spun her finger in a circle, and the game board opened up by itself,
 revealing the rows of black and white pieces that were packed away inside it.
".........It is a complete set, containing the game board and all the pieces.
 ......The records of the previous games are all there as well."
With a rustling sound, the books flipped through all their pages of their own accord, shut themselves,
 and flew to the side of the game board, where they waited.
 Inside them, all of the movements of the pieces during previous games were recorded...
".........I see.
 So you were short a player and a commentator..."
"We are also short on black tea.
 ......And, I suppose, dried plums.
 Of course, I will find some."
"..............................
 ......Okay.
 If you add on some mustard rice cakes, then we have a deal."
"The negotiations are concluded."
"I have one condition."
"Oh, and what is that?"
"I\'m going to be the Reader, right...?
 .........I have no love, so I might interpret all kinds of things in strange ways.
 ......However, the Reader is free to read things in a manner and with an intonation of her choosing."
"I only want to check the answers.
 ......I have no interest in the tale itself.
 .........The particular kind of tale you choose to create is of no interest to me whatsoever.
 ............Ah, yes.
 Now I see what you\'re after."
"..................Will you accept that condition?"
"Very well...
 I want to know the answers. You want an outlet for your grievances.
 The negotiations are concluded."
When FEATHERINE snapped her fingers once more,
 ......a large chair appeared, as though beckoning BERNKASTEL to sit there.
The chair, its design horribly mismatched with the furnishings of this room, ......was a throne.
Wait, I\'ve seen this before.
 .........This is—
"I acknowledge it. You may sit.
 You are the Game Master."
".........Are you sure?
 ......Are you really sure...?"
"You may create whatever sort of tale you like to ease your inner hatred.
 I am not interested.
 However, I have one condition as well.
 ......Provide all of the answers I seek.
 No hiding, concealment, or tricks."
"Heh, ......heheheheheheheheheh...!
 Leave it to me.
 Tearing apart the chest and ripping out the guts is my specialty.
 .........After all, you trained me."
"I shall make you some black tea.
 ......With my own hands, not magic.
 ......Let the master treat her miko to some tea..."
"Beato once told me that tea is best drunk in the company of a witch."
"It seems we differ in that regard......
 ......Heh, ...heheheheheheheheheheheheheheheh."
......At some point, that dish piled with biscuits...
...had reverted to a mountain of torn‐apart meat and a splatter of red.
 No, not just meat, ...even intestines...
"......Tea is best enjoyed—"
""With your fellow monsters.""
".........In that case, let\'s get the pieces ready.
 If we keep counting, this\'ll be game number seven, right?"
"Correct.
 An auspicious number."
"It won\'t be for Beato."
BERNKASTEL slowly picked up a black piece.
It was the piece that represented BEATRICE.
It was sometimes a king, sometimes a queen, and could even become a knight.
However, that was only if it got promoted.
Until then, it was only a trash piece, like a pawn.
First came piece positioning.
 Even this early, the witch\'s game had already begun.
BERNKASTEL took Beato\'s piece and slowly raised it high.
"First move, placement.
 BEATRICE on d8."
