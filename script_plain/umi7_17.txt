Quadrillion.
There\'s only one place you\'ll find that word on Rokkenjima.
Gold butterflies flitted from shadow to shadow, dodging raindrops.
"......Unless my memory is mistaken, this is probably the place."
It was......the chapel.
That mysterious building, one of the oldest on Rokkenjima, which had been built at the same time as the mansion.
It was called the chapel, but not once had Kinzo used it for worship, and the members of the family had never been allowed inside.
There were strict orders that none approach it without reason, and its purpose was always a mystery.
However, any mystery will lose its luster after several decades.
At some point, everyone forgot the chapel even existed,
 and that splendid building passed from the thoughts of Rokkenjima\'s residents......
Of course, this had been true for Beato as well.
Beato, who hated boredom, had no desire to approach places that humans never went.
Her last memory of the place was of the time she went in there to taunt Shannon as she tried to clean.
"......There can be no doubt.
 That is it.
 ......Quadrillion."
Beato looked up......above the door of the chapel.
There was a relief displayed over an arch.
English words were written there.
"‘You will be blessed only at a probability of a Quadrillion to one’.
 .........Heheh.
 So, you thought that was the probability of someone solving this riddle...?"
This chapel was built long ago.
If there is a mechanism like the one I imagine,
 ......Kinzo must have prepared that epitaph riddle many decades ago.
He must have been planning to use it as a ritual for choosing a fitting successor all this time.
......However, that ritual is now a ritual to open the door to the Golden Land and to my resurrection.
When I snapped my fingers,
 the ground bulged, and several dead trees sprouted out of it, curving and twisting like snakes.
They twisted around each other to form a ladder, which leaned itself against the door.
"If my guess is right, ......there\'s some sort of mechanism in that relief."
I slowly climbed the ladder.
Because of the size of the door, the relief was very high up.
This close up, it looks much bigger than it did from the ground.
"............Come to think of it, whenever we cleaned the chapel,
 ......this relief was the only thing that Genji always made sure he polished himself.
 ......I always wondered why he didn\'t leave something so trivial to the younger servants."
I thought it strange, but nothing more.
The Master treasured this relief, so the head servant cared for it himself.
 ......I always accepted that excuse.
But now, I understand.
There must be a trick to this relief.
And Genji polished it himself to make sure that no one else accidentally found out......
"So, from this Quadrillion, I am to sacrifice the six letters chosen by the key......?"
I prodded and played with the letter "Q".
My fingertips were soon covered with dust.
 However, I quickly realized that something felt strange about it.
"......Don\'t tell me this letter...
 ......No, ......it had to be like this.
 There would be no other way to offer up sacrifices......"
Beato grabbed hold of the letter "Q", and after experimenting with different levels of force,
 ......the letter came out with a scraping sound.
"Just......as I thought........."
Here\'s the "Q" I pulled out.
 And there\'s a wedge—no.
 It\'s a key.
A key was attached to the back of the "Q", and that had been stuck into a keyhole in the relief.
"......I see......
 In that case, I know what to do next.
 ......Very good, this "Q" key is a wrong answer.
 Away with you."
Beato carelessly tossed the "Q" key aside.
This was the first sacrifice.
She kept on pulling out the keys for the six letters representing "the key".
"......So, "a" will also be sacrificed.
 ......And both "i"s.
 ......And then the "n" at the end."
"Now, I only sacrifice one "l", ......but unfortunately, there are two "l"s here."
There were two "l"s.
 I didn\'t know which I should sacrifice.
I tried pulling both out, but the keys were of different shapes.
So, one is a right answer, and one is a wrong answer.
"Well, there are only two.
 ......If I make a mistake, I can just try the other one."
Unless messing up sets off a trap that blows up the island, of course.
Thinking it a waste of time to sit here worrying, I decided on the "l" on the right and pulled it out.
Five letters remained in the word.
"And now, the first twilight is over.
 ......On to the second twilight."
On the second twilight, those who remain shall tear apart the two who are close.
"The "d" and "r" are close.
 What does it mean to tear them apart...?
 Do I pull them out?"
But if I do, there will only be three letters left.
By this point, I was able to make a good guess at what the "gouge and kill" lines from the fourth twilight onwards meant.
"Gouge and kill probably means to turn the keys and take them out.
 In that case, the parts about going from head to leg must mean starting at the left and going right."
If that\'s the case, five letters have to remain on the board.
In other words, "tear apart" doesn\'t mean kill.
"If so, then we can read "tear apart" to mean putting a gap between the "d" and the "r".
 ......But how?
 Once again, there are two ways to do it..."
Do I remove the "d" and move it to the left?
Do I remove the "r" and move it to the right?
......After pondering this for some time, I realized that both choices were wrong.
"No.
 That\'s not right.
 I\'ve had it wrong since I removed that "l"."
A short while ago, I removed the right of the two "l"s.
However, if I had removed the left one...
......It would look like this.
If you line it up this way, it\'s easy to see the next step.
The "r" gets shifted to the right.
This way, all of the letters are spread out evenly.
This must be it.
"And this next part......is another tough one.
 ......Praise my name...?"
It\'s already clear that this is a word game.
Those who remain shall praise my noble name.
I am supposed to do something with the remaining five letters.
 Most likely, rearrange them.
"......‘u’, "d", "r", "l", "o"...
 ......Can I do something with these five letters to give them some sort of meaning?"
Praise...my name.
"Gh.
 ......How can I get stuck after coming so far......?
 How are these five letters supposed to praise a name...?!"
That man\'s name is Ushiromiya Kinzo.
Is the "u" part of Ushiromiya......?
No, several letters don\'t match, and there aren\'t nearly enough letters to make Ushiromiya...
"One thing that is certain... "My name" must refer to Kinzo.
 ......Then, does the "u" stand for Ushiromiya after all?
 Like an initial.
 ......Then what do the "d", "r", "l", and "o" stand for?
 They can\'t mean Kinzo.
 Do the "r" and "o"......stand for Rokkenjima...?
 The master of Rokkenjima, Kinzo......
 ......Hmm, not nearly enough letters......"
This riddle left me totally confused.
However, there were only five letters left.
There can\'t be so many possible combinations of those letters.
 I could use process of elimination.
Thinking I\'d play around with it, I pulled out the "u".
......There were four letters left.
 "d", "r", "l", and "o".
"...................................."
My idea that the "u" stood for Ushiromiya was like a heavenly oracle.
When I removed the "u", I thought of making a word with the remaining four letters.
"d", "r", "l", and "o".
Those four letters spun around in my head, changing their orders,
 ......and led me to a single English word that would serve to "praise" Kinzo...
"It\'s lord.
 ......Lord...!"
I had absolutely no basis for it.
 ......However, it was like a flash of inspiration.
I quickly changed the letters around before that flash faded from my mind.
"‘l’, "o", "r", "d"!
 Lord!
 "u"!
 Ushiromiya!
 ......Lord Ushiromiya! How do you like that?!"
"On the fourth twilight, .........gouge the head...
.........oho?!"
It was a key, so it wouldn\'t turn if it was the wrong one.
But it did turn.
 I could gouge it...!
With a sound of scraping stone, I gouged the first letter, the "l", ......and then pulled it out.
"Next! The fifth twilight...!
 Gouge the chest......and kill......!"
The "o" was gouged and pulled out easily.
Then, the "r".
 Next, the "d".
 And finally, the "u".
When I turned the key of the "u", I could feel a resistance, as though some mechanism had been activated.
I waited for something to change, ......but nothing did.
However, I had felt something happen.
A secret door or something must have opened up somewhere around here.
......Waiting around won\'t accomplish anything.
I\'ve probably done everything I can here......
All of the letters in "Quadrillion" had been removed.
"On the ninth twilight, ......the witch revives, and none shall be left alive......"
So now...has the witch...have I...revived......?
The tenth twilight.
The journey ends, and you shall reach the Home of the Gold......
When I stepped down off the ladder and looked around,
 ......I immediately noticed that small change.
"......That lion statue............"
At some point, the lion statue in front of the chapel had turned to face a different direction.
......What an elaborate mechanism...!
Did Kinzo plan up this extravagant device back when he first started building on this island......?
I walked up to the lion statue and stared at it.
Other than the fact that it was pointing a different direction, nothing had changed.
In that case, is the lion looking at something in particular now......?
I followed its line of sight.........and saw another lion statue.
And that lion statue had also changed its direction.
"I see......
 So, let the lions guide you.
 ......As elaborate as ever, I see, Kinzo."
I wasn\'t complaining anymore.
......I felt a bit of respect and awe at Kinzo for setting up such an intricate device...
and having it go undiscovered for all these years.
There were lion statues standing like guards at the entrance and the corners of the chapel.
The direction they faced had changed, pointing around to the back of the chapel.
There was something there.
"....................................
 ............Hoh........."
It was no longer a surprise.
This was after the mechanism in the relief.
 After being guided by the lions.
So, when a gaping open secret passageway appeared, .........with stairs leading down to the darkness below, ......it wasn\'t surprising to me anymore.
"So, .........is this the entrance to the Golden Land, Kinzo......?!!"
".........Did you find it...?
 Grandfather\'s......gold......?"
"Yes.
 .........At the end of my long, long journey......was the Golden Land."
"According to the previous games, there was an underground VIP room there, along with ten tons of gold, right?"
"Yes.
 After going down a rough stairway, ......there was a door at the end of the passage.
 Inside, it was beautifully furnished, a true VIP room."
"......And was the gold all you found there?"
"Yes, at the time......
 It would be a lie to say that I was not dizzied by the sight of all that gold stacked high..."
"............Is this...
...real......?"
I lightly touched the pile of gold with my finger.
It was hard...and cold.
I had almost thought that it might crumble like a sandcastle if I touched it.
Now, there could be no doubt.
This certainly was......a ten ton pile of gold ingots.
"......Haha,
 ...............ha......"
Considering the amount of gold I had just found, I figured I ought to be crying out in delight.
......I didn\'t really feel like laughing, but I thought it only good manners to do so in a situation like this,
 so I forced it out.
Because of this, only a few feeble laughs slipped from my mouth.
At that moment, even stronger than any delight...
was a feeling as though I\'d entered a place I wasn\'t supposed to be...
For a while, all I could do was stand there shocked, unsure what I should do now that the epitaph\'s riddle had been completed.
Then, I heard approaching footsteps.
They were coming from the stairway I had entered by.
Someone was coming.
 Could it be...Kinzo?
If he finds out I\'ve been in a place like this, won\'t I get scolded harshly......?
I thought about hiding and pretending this never happened, but my legs wouldn\'t move.
I kept standing there, stunned, in front of the pile of gold......as the footsteps drew closer and closer...
".................................!"
The door opened, ......and I saw who it was.
......It............wasn\'t Kinzo.
"................................."
".........You......"
"......Did you reach this place by your power alone?"
"I‐......indeed..."
"................................."
For some time, Genji stared at Beato in silence, as though he was calculating something.
Then, he slowly clapped his hands together.
 ......He did it again, over and over.
It took quite a long time before I realized that he was applauding me...
"The Master has said that he will hand over the gold and the headship to the first person who solves the epitaph.
 ......And, he believed that this person would be BEATRICE..."
"......BEATRICE......
 .........Me......?"
"This is fate.
 .........It is fate that brought you to this day."
".............................."
I didn\'t really understand what Genji was saying.
The shock of seeing the gold still had me paralyzed...
"......Come this way."
"O‐okay......"
Genji opened a closet.
Inside it was a dress form wearing a beautiful dress made of black cloth and golden stitching.
When I saw it, I understood immediately.
......It was the witch\'s dress.
The black dress worn by the BEATRICE in the portrait......
"Change into this."
"......This is.........."
"It is something that.........you once wore."
I\'ve never worn a dress like this.
 However, I understood what Genji meant.
This dress was one that BEATRICE once wore.
And the one who shows a miracle by solving the epitaph is BEATRICE.
By reaching this room, .........I had succeeded the position of the real BEATRICE,
 the one in the portrait.
Why do I call myself BEATRICE?
Because the name of the Golden Witch who rules over Rokkenjima\'s night is BEATRICE.
 ......That\'s right.
 I was never the real BEATRICE.
I was a different witch, stealing the name of the witch from Kinzo\'s delusions.
And now, ......I have become the real BEATRICE......
By solving the epitaph\'s riddle, I would achieve my resurrection.
......I was the one who decided on that rule, or so I thought...
But as it turns out, ......this really was.........a ritual to resurrect BEATRICE...
I believed that I could create my own fate with magic.
I was a master of that magic, ......yet fate had led me here by the hand...
At this moment, I was forced to truly accept and believe in this word called "fate"...
"And after I put this on.........?"
"......You will go to the Master.
 Ready yourself."
".........Wait here."
"......O‐...okay."
"My lord.
 It is Genji."
After Genji knocked, the sound of the study\'s door unlocking could be heard.
After a single glance telling me to wait, Genji entered alone.
"I cannot believe that this day has come......
 Fate can be such a strange thing......"
Kumasawa was with us too.
I thought this dress, which didn\'t really suit me, would lead to a lot of jokes, ......but she didn\'t laugh at me at all.
On the contrary, when she saw me, ......her expression had turned stern, as though a long‐awaited day had finally come.
......My heart raced.
It wasn\'t supposed to matter who solved the epitaph.
 There shouldn\'t be anything strange about me solving it......
Everyone else maintained solemn expressions, ......and that, along with everything else, made this feel like some sort of grand ceremony.
The suffocating silence continued.
Eventually, the door opened, and Genji peeked out.
".........Please enter,
 .........BEATRICE‐sama."
He was saying those words to me, ......but not to the person I had been until a short while ago.
"....................."
"Go ahead,
 ......BEATRICE‐sama..."
Kumasawa also urged me forward with a respectful bow.
Kinzo was probably waiting for me inside.
What expression should I wear as I go in...?
 How should I greet him...?
I don\'t have a clue...
As the two of them motioned me forward, it was all I could do to avoid tripping over my dress as I walked.
".........Kinzo‐san.
 She is here."
Kinzo was before the portrait of BEATRICE, crouched on the ground as though kneeling.
At Nanjo\'s words, he slowly turned, still crouching...
"...............Oh...
 .........Oohhhhhh........."
Kinzo\'s eyes were already red with crying.
When he saw me, he groaned with wonder.
"......BEATRICE......
 .........BEATRICE........."
Had he even forgotten how to stand up?
He crawled over to where I was.
...As he called out to me with the name of the woman he had loved long ago.
I was too stunned to move.
Then, Kinzo grabbed the hem of my dress, gripped it tightly, ......then curled up and sobbed.
"BEATRICE......
 ......I\'m sorry. I\'m so sorry......
 I knew how you felt, ......and yet I......
 I\'m so sorry...... Forgive me...... Forgive me, I beg you......"
"...................................."
There was nothing I could say.
 However, just standing here like this was all I needed to do.
Kinzo\'s moment of atonement, the moment he had spent half of his life searching for, had finally come.
......A human\'s life is packed with sin.
So, humans seek forgiveness while they still live.
 However, in most cases, there are none in this world capable of giving such forgiveness.
It was like that for Kinzo.
 There was no longer anyone in the world who could give that to him.
......But a miracle had woven one together, and in this moment, he had obtained the impossible...
"Oooohhhh, BEATRICE...
 ......BEATRICE......
 ...You need not forgive me, you need not say anything...!
 All I ever wanted......was to say one word......of apology......!
 Oooohhhhhh........."
Kinzo kept grasping the dress\'s hem and sobbing.
The sins of humans are not forgiven by other people.
They find forgiveness through regret and repentance.
......I want to believe that some sin, some fault of his......has been forgiven thanks to the way I look...
Kinzo\'s sobbing gradually ceased,
 ......and he slowly looked up at me and rose.
He staggered.
 Nanjo rushed forward to support him.
"................................."
".........To know.........that you are alive......
 ......It brings me such...joy......"
This time, his words weren\'t directed through me, but at me.
I hesitated, unsure how I should respond.
"......My lord, I beg your forgiveness for keeping this a secret from you all this time."
"No matter.
 ......I do not fault you, Genji...
 ......Considering the sin that I committed, ......every single day until now has been necessary for my atonement......"
"However, there can be no doubt that today\'s miracle is a true one.
 ......By her own power, without anyone\'s help,
 ......she solved the epitaph before anyone else."
"You did well.........to solve that convoluted epitaph......"
"Th‐.........thanks......"
"......Yes.
 ......Your voice resembles your mother\'s.
 Even your face reminds me of that mother and daughter......
 ...There can be no doubt that BEATRICE\'s blood flows through your veins......"
"Yes.
 ......The traces of the lady of Kuwadorian in her youth are right there."
Who......are they saying I look like......?
"......BEATRICE‐sama,
 please forgive me for keeping what I am about to tell you a secret for all this time.
 You are the child of BEATRICE‐sama and the Master."
"........................What......?"
"It\'s true.
 ......You have been raised as a child without parents.
 However, your true father is the Master.
 And your true mother......is BEATRICE‐sama."
"......Is that, ......umm, ......really............?"
"Yes.
 You truly are a descendant of BEATRICE‐sama."
Is such a strange fate.........really possible......?
I\'ve dreamed about it.
 Dreamed about what it\'d be like to be the Golden Witch, BEATRICE.
But that dream was for me alone.
So, I\'d dreamed that if I solved the epitaph,
 ......and carried out its ritual, I would revive as the true BEATRICE.
......Is it really conceivable...
...that after I solved it...
...BEATRICE actually did revive......?
"I...
...truly carry...
......BEATRICE\'s...
......blood......?"
"Yes.
 There is no doubt of that whatsoever."
"......It must have been hard for you to live until this day without knowing a parent\'s affection...
 ......And yet, look at how wonderfully you\'ve grown......"
"......So, ......you all knew.........?
 About me......?"
Genji, Kumasawa, and even Nanjo nodded wordlessly.
......Now that I think about it, that explains so many things.
I was always...in some way...special.
Genji and especially Kumasawa always treated me very kindly.
Then, ......does that mean this day is a promised day, which would eventually have come no matter what......?
I don\'t understand anything anymore.
It\'s all God\'s miracle.
The promised fate has led me to this day.
".........BEATRICE.
 ............No,
 .........Lion."
"...............?"
"That is the name I wanted to give you......"
"......It is your true name."
"Lion......
 I will now return to you everything that BEATRICE gave me.
 ......I return to you the gold, as well as everything of the Ushiromiya family, which was created by it."
Kinzo stuck out a wrinkled hand.
On his finger was a ring with the One‐winged Eagle crest, which was the symbol of the Ushiromiya family head.
He pulled it off, grasped it tightly, and then held it out to me.
......I didn\'t know what to do.
Slowly, as though they were being drawn forward, ......I held out my hands, palms up.
After pressing his fist against my cupped hands, Kinzo slowly opened his hand and let the ring drop.
".........Lion, my child.........
 ......That your fate has been toyed with is a result of my sin.
 ......Please forgive me...
 ......You now inherit my ring as the new and proper head of the Ushiromiya family."
"All of that gold belongs to you.
 I ask that you use it as you please, and hope that it will be enough to heal some small part of the pain you have suffered...
 That trifling amount of gold may be nothing in comparison with the sin I committed,
 .........but even so, it should be enough to bring you some comfort."
"Th‐.........thank...you........."
".........Lion.
 .........I have one.........final request."
"Wh‐......what is that.........?"
"Could you..................
.........call me........."
"......Huh? ......Sorry, what did you say......?"
"Could you............call me.........Father?"
".............................."
"......I understand why you are not able to...
 ......I have not been a father to you in any way.
 Furthermore, you have been raised without knowing anything about your father.
 ......I realize that it\'s not a name you can call me by.
 And, I realize that I have no right to ask this of you.
 .........But, knowing all of that, ......still, I ask you......
 ......If I could just hear that, ......I would have no further regrets......"
.........After being asked like that, ......was it possible for me to refuse?
Even if I am his child, ......I cannot see him as my father...
So, I felt a strong resistance to saying that word.
But......I decided that saying it was the right thing to do.
Only God can truly forgive sins.
But, ......though it may be temporary,
 people can be saved by the forgiveness of others.
".........F‐....................."
"........................"
"..................
 .........Fath......er............"
"Heh, ............heheheh............"
That awkward word made Kinzo laugh.
Drops of silver fell from both of his eyes.
At that moment, ......the shadow that had covered his face......was wiped away......
"Thank you, ......Lion.
 My child......
 .........And BEATRICE, as well.
 Thank you for this last chance......to ask for forgiveness........."
"......Of course, I don\'t believe that such a simple act will earn me forgiveness.
 ......The rest, I will do as I burn in the fires of hell.
 .........I, Ushiromiya Kinzo, have no more regrets in this life!!
 None at all! No regrets or things left undone!!
 Wahaha, ......wahahahahahahahaahahah!!
 Waaahhahahahahaahahahahahaha!!!"
Looking up to the heavens, Kinzo spread his arms as though facing an applauding audience,
 ......laughing at the top of his lungs.
It was the final pleasure, known only by those who have been released from all regrets of this world.
.........Kinzo\'s laugh weakened, ......and when it disappeared...
He dropped to his knees...
...like a puppet with its strings cut...
............and slowly...
......fell to the ground.........
"......M‐.........my lord......"
"Doctor Nanjo......"
"Y‐......yes........."
Though their master had fallen, ......they walked up to him slowly.
They already knew.
Kinzo\'s soul......had already burned itself out.
After checking Kinzo\'s pulse, Nanjo shook his head and stood back up.
"............It was a peaceful death.
 ......I don\'t think he had any regrets at all."
"It may be......that the Master died long before now.
 ......It was only his magic and tenacity that kept him here so long.
 ......And.........once he finally had a chance to apologize to BEATRICE‐sama for everything, .........he finished everything he had to do..."
".........Please, ......rest in peace.
 ............I believe that you have redeemed yourself."
".................................Father........."
That was...
...the one‐night reunion...
...between me and my father...
...and also our final farewell......
".........This gold all belongs to you now.
 ......If you wish to exchange it for money, I can arrange for that."
"I hear it\'s worth 20 billion yen.
 .........All of your dreams in this world can now be granted with money."
"Hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho......
 It must be tough to think of what to do with this much money when it suddenly comes your way."
"............There is nothing I desire among the things money can buy.
 ......So, for the present, I would like to leave this here."
......Of course, I\'m glad I have a lot of money.
However, money can\'t heal the pain in my heart.
I just.........want him to come back.
"As you wish.
 Then it shall be left here.
 ......Also, take this key."
".........What is this?"
"It is the key to this underground VIP room.
 If you use this, you won\'t need to use the more complicated device."
She was the only one who knew the answer to the epitaph\'s riddle, and the only key to this place was now hers.
......At this point, she truly was the master of this golden VIP room.
"You are already the master of Rokkenjima.
 You have the right to know all of this island\'s secrets."
".........We should talk about Kuwadorian too."
"That\'s the mansion your mother lived in.
 ......I\'m sure you\'ve heard rumors about it."
"Kuwadorian........."
"There are two mansions on this island, one at either end.
 ......One is the mansion we know well.
 The other is a hidden mansion known as Kuwadorian."
"Below this island are the remains of a military base built during the war.
 The Master used that to travel between the two ends of the island..."
"There is an underground path in the back of this room, and if you follow it, you will reach the basement of Kuwadorian on the other end of this island.
 ......That is a secret mansion, which only the Master knew of.
 Of course, that mansion, like everything else, now belongs to the new head."
"......It\'s the mansion your mother lived in.
 It\'s probably worth taking a trip over there sometime."
"My......mother............"
I\'ve lived alone my whole life.
The only person I\'ve ever felt like calling "Mother" is Kumasawa‐san, who always helped me out.
The mansion where a mother I\'ve never met nor seen lived...
.........Who in the world.........am I......?
"Ask any questions you wish.
 ......You now deserve to know everything."
"......Right now, ......I\'m feeling very confused.
 ......I don\'t even know where I should start asking questions.
 ......But I\'m sure......I\'ll think of plenty of things to ask about.
 ......When I do, please tell me..."
"As you wish."
"A‐......also,
 ......being treated so respectfully like that...
is a bit uncomfortable.
 I\'d be happier if you could talk to me the same way you\'ve always done."
"If that is what you wish, then I will do so."
"Hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho.
 That\'s easier for me too."
".........Well now.
 What will we do now, Genji‐san?
 ......Kinzo‐san is dead."
"I will tell Krauss‐sama and Madam that he has passed away.
 ......Then, we must tell them that Lion‐sama is the official successor to the headship.
 After all, from this point forth, you are the Ushiromiya family head."
"M‐me as the head? That\'s......
 And isn\'t Krauss‐sama the successor......?"
"The one who solves the epitaph\'s riddle is the successor.
 .........There exists a will specifying this.
 .........The Master\'s final order was that you were to inherit everything."
"P‐please wait...!
 I appreciate the sentiment, ......but I can\'t do the job of being the successor,
 ......and I can\'t accept such a big responsibility.
 I think it would be better for Krauss‐sama to inherit that role......"
".........Are you certain?"
"Today, ......I have learned who I am.
 ......Everyone knows about their parents,
 but I didn\'t, since the time of my birth.
 ......And here, today, I finally learned the truth.
 ......That alone is enough for me."
If I suddenly became the Ushiromiya family head, how would Krauss‐sama react?
 How angry would Madam be?
I don\'t want to become the head if it means making them feel like that.
Today, I learned who I am.
Who gave birth to me, how, and when?
 ......These are things I want to learn from them as time goes by.
That alone is enough.
".........I am Lion.
 ......And I am the Golden Witch, BEATRICE.
 Knowing that is enough for me.
 ......I don\'t plan on calling myself the head.
 ......Krauss‐sama can take that job."
"Is that your order, as the Ushiromiya family head?"
".........Yes."
".....................
 ......As you wish, Master.
 Then I will make it so."
"And please, don\'t tell anyone about what happened tonight.
 .........I want to stay me.
 ......There\'s nothing I\'d want to do if I had the Ushiromiya headship or the gold."
......I just...
"I want to wait.........here on this island......as I have done in the past.
 I want everything to be exactly the same as it was.
 .........That\'s my only wish."
"...........................
 As you wish, Master.
 ......Everything that has happened tonight will not go beyond those present here.
 ......Kumasawa.
 Doctor Nanjo.
 That is the wish of the new head."
"......If that\'s what you want, I have no objections.
 Kinzo‐san\'s will entrusts everything to you.
 If this is what you want to do, none of us will complain."
"You say "exactly the same as it was",
 ......but do you really mean exactly the same...?
 With no differences at all...?"
"Yes.
 .........We\'ll keep this a secret.
 ......This place and the gold will be sealed away.
 If I need money, I\'ll ask you about it then.
 .........That\'s enough for me."
"As you wish.
 The mechanism leading to this place and the key both belong to you.
 ......And all of us swear to keep the events of this night a secret.
 .........Krauss‐sama will be the successor,
 ......but in my heart, you will be the only true successor."
"......As you have ordered, we will behave the same way we always have, but please order us whenever it suits you.
 You are my only master."
"..................Th‐.........thank you very much..."
A vast mountain of gold and the ring of the Ushiromiya family head.
The dress of the portrait BEATRICE.
And.........I became the true BEATRICE, the Golden Witch.
Right here in my very own Golden Land.
If I think about it, not much has actually changed.
After all, I\'ve always been the Golden Witch. ......I\'ve just had a few more people acknowledge that.
{a:c:November 29th.
The day I became a true witch.}
{a:c:
Oh, I am one yet many.
I am the Golden Witch, BEATRICE.}
{a:c:
The true ruler of Rokkenjima,......and the possessor of endless gold.}
{a:c:
Yet, I am in no way complete.}
{a:c:
......Here I wait...for the return of the one person I love......}
