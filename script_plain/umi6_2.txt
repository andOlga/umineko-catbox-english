At one time, only Beato and her fellow witches had gathered in this smoking room to chat.
Now, however, an unusually large number of people were present.
"Ehheheheheh.
 I wonder what kind of game Battler\'s going to show us."
"......I don\'t care what...
as long as it\'s fun enough to relieve my boredom as I crush it."
"Leave everything to me, my master!
 I will perform to my fullest and give you the results you desire!"
"Yeah, you\'d better.
 ......I kept making strange faces all the time last game thanks to you...
 Thought I might start getting wrinkles."
"Th‐there\'s no need to worry.
 The beauty of your face is without peer, no matter how wrinkly it may get."
"........................!!!"
"Eheheheh!
 It\'s rare to see Bern in such high spirits.
 Beato\'s game board really is something else."
"......How sad it is that the master of this game board is no longer with US."
"A tiger dies and leaves behind its hide.
 Looks like Beato has died and left behind her game."
"Even though chess still exists, no one knows the name of the person who invented it."
"Oh, you\'re right!
 Kyahahaha, poor game creato~rs!"
"Come to think of it, Battler‐san is really keeping us waiting, isn\'t he?
 Is he still setting up the sixth game?"
"......Gertrude.
 How are Lord BATTLER\'s preparations PROGRESSING?"
"For your attention: I beg to inform you of the following.
 ......Know that he will be finished very soon."
"He must have a lot of confidence in what he\'s creating to keep us waiting this long.
 ......He really humiliated me in front of my master last time.
 I\'ll defeat him no matter what it takes...!
 And you in particular! Make sure you don\'t screw up again...!"
"......I will meet the challenge with all of my strength."
The previous Game Master, LAMBDADELTA,
 had confirmed that Battler understood everything about Beato\'s game.
However, in order to prove it,
 Battler would have to run this game by himself and carry it through to completion.
In other words, if Erika could crush this game of Battler\'s,
 she would, in effect, wipe away the dishonor of that last game.
Though Erika was chomping at the bit to get started,
 it was taking Battler quite some time to show himself.
Then, a swarm of gold butterflies swelled out of nothing and formed a human shape.
From the shape of that familiar dress, everyone immediately realized who it was.
"Ah, look, it\'s BEATRICE‐san.
 And I thought you\'d died and disappeared last time."
"......Beato the player is the one who disappeared.
 This is probably just a piece...Battler\'s piece."
"Even if she is a piece, it does not change the fact that it is HER."
BEATRICE gave an elegant curtsy as she appeared.
This humble entrance was so vastly different from her usual high‐pitched laugh...
that it created a sense of tension as they waited for the start of the sixth game to be announced at last...
"Father will be here very soon.
 I ask that you wait for just a short while longer......"
"...............
 ...Aha.
 Father? What\'s that?
 This game\'s new twist on things?"
Not only had Beato started talking in an unusually polite manner,
 she had also used the word "Father"...probably referring to Battler.
For an instant, everyone was stunned into silence,
 but they quickly realized that this was part of something bigger, and they grinned.
Beato wasn\'t the type who could keep up this kind of act for long.
It would probably fall apart in a few seconds, leaving her laughing and cackling rudely at everyone.
Erika, who was itching for a fight, went for Beato almost at once.
"I never expected that incompetent Battler‐san...
to reach the truth of your game."
"......It must be Father\'s talent that led him to his profound understanding.
 He really is clever."
"...............
 You\'re pretty lucky, aren\'t you?
 If Battler hadn\'t become the Game Master, you would never have revived again.
 You certainly have the luck of the devil."
"......The devil?"
"In any case,
 I\'m going to pay you back in full for last time.
 You\'re just one of Battler\'s delusions, fantasies... I\'ll erase every part of you and knock you down into the abyss of oblivion."
"Well, {ruby:watashi:I} also intend to hold my own.
 ......I, um, look forward to having a good, clean fight."
"...........................???"
By this point, everyone realized that something weird was going on.
There was no doubt that the face, the dress, and the hair were all BEATRICE\'s.
......However, ......her expression was different.
Even though she had Beato\'s face, Beato would never show anyone an expression like that.
"....................."
"......Just who...are you?"
There was a heavy silence.
......LAMBDADELTA spoke for everyone there.
At first, Beato wore a smiling yet confused expression.
 ......However, when she realized that the mood had gone suddenly stiff, her expression finally darkened, and she hung her head.
"Who......are you?"
"......You appear to be Lady BEATRICE...
...but is that TRUE...?"
Even Dlanor was forced to ask despite the rudeness of the question.
That was how much...
this woman...
who appeared to be Beato...
was not.
".........Am I somehow different from the BEATRICE...
...that all of you were expecting?"
"What......are you talking about?"
"Wait a second,
 don\'t tell me you have amnesia or something...?"
"I, ...I was only born recently, so I have no memories at all.
 ......B‐but I...!
 I\'m studying hard...in order to become the BEATRICE you all expect—"
{a:c:
"Beato.
 ......I thought I told you to stay in your room."}
Battler\'s voice came out of nowhere.
......His tone was very slightly cold.
Beato\'s expression looked like that of a young girl being scolded.
With a swirl of gold butterflies,
 ......Battler appeared.
His dignified bearing and appearance were fitting for the ruler of this game.
......However, his expression was gloomy...
and his gaze was directed at Beato.
"......Go back to your room.
 You aren\'t supposed to be here."
"I, ...I just wanted to help you however I could, Father......"
"Go. To your room."
He spoke both softly and forcefully.
 Battler didn\'t leave her any room for debate.
Beato hung her head and curtsied as she prepared to leave the room...
"Also."
"Y‐yes, what is it, Father?"
"......My name is Battler.
 ...Never call me by another name again."
"...Y‐
.........yes."
Beato melted into a swarm of butterflies and disappeared.
This was the first part of the tale with Battler as the Game Master.
The witches had all expected him to come forward with some flashy, big developments, ...so they were all fairly confused.
......Their mouths were still hanging open.
"......This is an unusual approach."
"Pardon me.
 ......Please forget what you saw just now."
"Hmph, so, are you trying to trick us with this?
 You\'re scheming to give us the wrong impression, like another North Wind and the Sun strategy, aren\'t you?"
"......Is there something WRONG?"
"Don\'t worry about it.
 It has nothing to do with you people."
"I see.
 Then it doesn\'t matter.
 Alright, Battler! Please start up the new game right away!
 You\'ve kept us waiting so long, it\'s gotten totally boring!"
"......Sure.
 Let\'s start the sixth game.
 ......Erika, and you too, BERNKASTEL.
 This will be my tale, proof that I\'ve reached the truth about Beato.
 ...LAMBDADELTA.
 Please oversee this game, as a former Game Master."
"Sure, looking forward to it. What\'s the title?"
"......‘Dawn’.
 ...As in, the Dawn of the Golden Witch."
"Of course, the winter sun is quick to sink back below the horizon."
"Of course, my master.
 I\'ll drag it back down for you right away.
 At least your title is <good>, Battler‐san. I\'ll give you that much."
"I\'m glad you like it.
 ...Then let\'s get started.
 The sixth game will now begin."
Battler solemnly announced the start of the game.
......Compared to his fired‐up attitude at the end of the last game, where he and Erika had sworn to settle everything next time,
 he was extremely quiet now......
"......Ange.
 Beato seems very different from the way she was before."
"I\'m surprised too.
 ......I don\'t have a clue what\'s going on.
 In fact, I don\'t even get why Beato\'s revived in the first place.
 I just finished reading it a little while ago, ......but at the end of the previous tale,
 didn\'t she die just before Onii‐chan reached the truth?"
"There are two kinds of death in this world.
 ......One of them is when a piece is taken from the game board.
 This is only a death within the bounds of the game, and these lives can revive over and over again each time you start a new game."
"......And that\'s why the witches are so merciless when it comes to taking those lives..."
To the witch players,
 the lives of those characters who appear on the game board are no different from pieces on a chess board that take other pieces and get taken.
After all, these pieces will be set up again when the next game starts.
"Maria\'s Sakutarou is a prime example of these."
"......Sakutarou is Onee‐chan\'s piece...?"
Yes, ......that does make sense.
On the game board that represents the inside of Onee‐chan\'s head, Sakutarou certainly does exist,
 and is a piece which always stays by her side.
Though he\'s nothing more than a stuffed animal in the real world,
 on Onee‐chan\'s game board, he is a full piece, no different from any other piece.
"But, ......I wonder.
 ...On the witches\' game board, it\'s easy to revive a piece, right?
 ......But Onee‐chan was unable to revive Sakutarou in her world."
"......That\'s because she lost that completely unique stuffed animal that was his vessel.
 Because of this, the conditions for that piece\'s existence were violated, and it became impossible to revive him on Maria\'s game board.
 ......The only reason you were able to revive Sakutarou on the game board was because you once again satisfied the conditions for his existence, correct?"
".........True."
Maria onee‐chan...
was only unable to revive him because she had lost the stuffed animal that was his vessel.
......If, like my family on Beato\'s game board,
 she hadn\'t needed a "vessel" for him, she would have been able to revive him as often as she wanted.
"Got it.
 ......I see that Sakutarou might be considered Onee‐chan\'s piece.
 At least, as long as his vessel was okay, he could have been revived over and over again."
"Correct.
 As long as the vessel is safe, it can be revived over and over again.
 That\'s what the life of a piece is like..."
"......That\'s the first kind of death in this world.
 ......What\'s the second?"
"That\'s the death of beings outside the game board.
 To continue with the Sakutarou example, this would be like Maria\'s death."
"Not the piece,
 ......but the real Onee‐chan\'s death, right?"
"It doesn\'t have to be her death.
 Loss of interest or concern would have the same effect.
 ......When Maria grows up from playing with stuffed animals, then "Maria the game player" will die.
 It\'s as quick and easy as turning off the switch on a TV when you get bored of it."
".........I see.
 In that case, "Beato the player" completely gave up on winning during the last game,
 ......so she died and vanished.
 ...Which means that if Beato thinks she has a chance of defeating Onii‐chan again, she\'ll come back to life, right?"
"Logically, that is true.
 It\'s the same for people, witches, and even gods.
 If they lose interest and concern, they can die at any time.
 And if they regain that interest, they can revive at any time.
 ......However, though the concept of time does not exist in the world of gods, who can revive whenever they want,
 time shoots by like an arrow in the human world, and it is not so easy there..."
"That\'s true.
 Skipping school for one day might not be a problem, but if you skip for three days in a row, it\'d be really hard to convince yourself to go back."
"And what if that stretched out for a month, a year, a decade?
 What if it lasted for a thousand years, like the world of witches?"
"......I see.
 If you skipped for that long, it would mean your "death" as far as society is concerned.
 ......If you remained dead for that long,
 not only would you be unable to catch up on all you missed in the world at large, you\'d also lose any motivation you might\'ve had when you left."
"......So, even though you\'d be alive, you could say that you\'d died once.
 You would never again......be able to regain the self that you once were. It would never revive."
"Beato lost any chance or hope of winning.
 ......Even though she knew this, she pretended not to and kept on fighting for many, many games.
 So, Beato will not return.
 Her hopes were crushed.
 She\'s spent all of the willpower that she might have used to regain the will to fight.
 Therefore,
 ......

that BEATRICE will never revive again}."
That Beato, who just sat around the whole time with empty eyes in the fifth game...
...must have been her corpse.
She had managed to remain on the game board despite it all,
 ......but then even that corpse was wiped away...
If Beato had been the Game Master at that time instead of LAMBDADELTA,
 the game board itself would have vanished at that moment, and everything would have ended.
Come to think of it, Beato started to lose the will to fight back near the end of the fourth game.
When Beato loses her will to fight, ......the world of this game disappears.
However, the witches wanted to keep playing in this game board world,
 so LAMBDADELTA bound Beato in place with the curse of that shackle.
She used that shackle to make sure that the game board wouldn\'t disappear,
 even if Beato did lose the will to fight.
In chess, this would be the equivalent of removing the set time limit for each turn,
 making it endless.
However, simply having the game endlessly paused on Beato\'s turn would cause the witches to die from their illness of boredom.
That\'s why LAMBDADELTA took the position of Game Master.
......Starting then, Beato\'s existence was no longer one of the conditions necessary for the game to exist.
That\'s probably why the shackles binding her to the game board were released.
And that explains why she disappeared in the fifth game...
"......So,
 when Onii‐chan managed to reach the truth,
 ...it was one game too late for him to tell Beato about it."
"The fifth game was a form of charity on LAMBDADELTA\'s part.
 ......She merely showed Battler some mercy as the Witch of Certainty, acknowledging his strong desire to reach the truth no matter what..."
".........How can you call that charity?
 It\'s just those fickle witches killing time.
 ......Let\'s get back to the point.
 So, that means this weird Beato isn\'t the player Beato.
 She\'s just a piece Beato."
"Yes.
 ......And if that is so, you would expect her to turn out as the Beato everyone knows well.
 ......That should also be the kind of Beato that Battler wants..."
".....................
 ......You mean,
 ...he wasn\'t satisfied with just a doll?"
When playing with dolls,
 one can project the personality they most desire onto the doll.
......However, since you are acting out their part, nothing unexpected can ever happen.
You cannot hope for any unanticipated happiness.
In the human world, there is nothing so boring as predictability.
That\'s why, though a doll can become a person\'s best friend in the world,
 ......people eventually get bored and outgrow them...
Onii‐chan only wants the real Beato.
He couldn\'t bear having a doll that he could only make act like Beato...
".........A Beato born as Battler\'s piece...
would probably move exactly according to Battler\'s wishes."
"She is a piece, so that\'s only natural.
 Pieces move according to their player\'s directions.
 ......And they are incapable of moving in any other way.
 ......I see what it is Onii‐chan wants.
 Then, just who is this weird Beato?"
"......Battler might be trying to revive Beato in the truest sense.
 ......It is the never‐dying dream held by the children of man."
"You just used the red to say that wasn\'t possible."
"......That Beato has no chance of reviving.
 However, that doesn\'t mean that it is impossible to create "Beato" again...
 Have you forgotten?
 I believe that BERNKASTEL herself revealed Beato\'s true form at the end of the first game..."
"........................
 ......Now I remember.
 ...She said something about how Beato exists as the incarnation of the rules."
"Rules and information, brought together,
 ultimately took the form of the witch known as BEATRICE.
 If that pattern is followed once more, the same BEATRICE will be born again,
 and perhaps one could call that a resurrection..."
".........In other words, that weird Beato...
...is like an egg of Beato, ...or else a chick."
"That interpretation is probably accurate...
 ......In short, this Beato is a chick that might become that Beato."
"And that means,
 .........this pure and lovable kid will eventually grow into that screwed up, crazy witch."
In other words, that Beato is a baby version of the Beato we all know.
So, just like how no person is born evil,
 ......the newborn Beato isn\'t evil either.
Even though she really is a different person, .........if you measure her by her basis...her soul...
...then maybe you really could call this a resurrection.
......However, ......this reality can\'t possibly be easy to accept.
Though she may technically be Beato herself,
 ......she is also, without a doubt, ......a different person.
And that way she acts...would make anyone feel as though something\'s out of place......
"How entertaining...
 ......Hearing you read aloud is far from boring."
"......I wonder if you even really need someone to read aloud for you.
 ...It looks like you already know everything."
"I only reached that thought because I am engaged in a conversation with you.
 ......My thoughts are more numerous than the stars in the sky.
 I only appear to know everything to a child of man like you.
 ......However, without you here, I am nothing but a weak, sickly person without even the power to think..."
"If you\'d just said that in the first place, I\'d have agreed to read for you a lot more easily."
"......My mood just happened to improve.
 ...Don\'t get an over‐swelled impression of yourself.
 I think of your life as nothing more than a leaf one may lose after using it as a bookmark..."
"‘Please continue reading’,
 is how I choose to interpret that.
 OK?"
"Heh......
 Far from boring.
 ...You really do make an excellent miko."
FEATHERINE rocked back in her rocking chair and looked up at the ceiling,
 laughing as though the conversation itself was pleasant for her.
Ange was slowly figuring out how to deal with this strange witch.
......This person was also...bored.
When a sick person has been in bed for a long time and gets too bored, they sometimes act in a rebellious way.
On the other hand, they also get a little bored of being treated kindly all the time.
She may want to be respected for her superiority,
 but it\'s probably more interesting for her when she\'s spoken to a little rudely.
......What a coincidence.
 That\'s exactly how I used to be.
"Anyway.
 ......From what we learned in the fourth game, there\'s no doubt that there was some kind of bad blood between Beato and Onii‐chan in the past.
 Learning about this Beato might give us a key towards finding the truth."
"It does seem so.
 ......It has caught my interest as well.
 ...Let us read her tale too."
"Oh, sure, as you wish, my master."
Ange raised her hands like a conductor, and the bookshelves in this bizarre study responded.
......Once again, several books floated out and began to swirl around Ange......
Kinzo\'s study is the room belonging to the master in the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} world.
So, this study in the world of nonhumans belonged to the master of the game board...
...and was a place where he could look down upon the {y:0:Humans}{n:0:humans}...
Therefore, it was understandable that one might mistake the imposing, robe‐clad man in the center of the study for Kinzo,
 if only for a second.
It wasn\'t Kinzo.
......It was Battler, the one who had taken up the position of Game Master,
 and who had become the new territory lord of this world.
"................................."
Around Battler was a swirl of glowing fragments, sparkling like the night sky,
 ......and on the floor was what appeared to be a red magic circle.
To an outsider, it would have appeared to be nothing more than an incomprehensible geometric shape.
But to Battler, who stood at its center,
 it was the outline for a new tale...
A new line grew across the magic circle, following Battler\'s gaze.
Then, at the instant it connected with a complicated symbol, the entire magic circle flashed brightly.
"......So,
 ......how does it look?"
"It is splendid, my lord.
 ......The sixth game is complete."
As Battler wiped his forehead and finally relaxed,
 Genji, who was standing behind him and watching over his every move, nodded deeply in response.
"......I always thought being a Game Master meant you could make the tale however you want,
 ......but this is seriously harder than I thought it\'d be."
"You must write up multiple tales and make the inner and outer sides of the story match.
 ......And yet, you have displayed such skill, it is hard to believe that this is your first time.
 ......I believe even Erika‐sama will be satisfied with this game."
"Well, hopefully it matches that great detective\'s tastes.
 ......Still, ...I\'ve got to honestly respect Beato now.
 ...I can hardly believe that she managed to create such complicated stories so easily."
"......It was not easy.
 ......BEATRICE‐sama spent a long, long time deliberating, and each time she created a tale, she would worry over various contradictions.
 She was constantly battling with logic errors."
"Logic errors?"
"That is when the two sides of the tale do not meet, creating a contradiction.
 ......When this happens, it becomes a fatal violation of the rules known as a logic error, and the game board will immediately collapse and be destroyed.
 It is the greatest and worst form of error that the witch side can make, and one which must always be avoided."
"And Beato...
got close to bumping into those several times in her games...?"
"......She fought with them every time she created a game.
 ...I believe it grew even more difficult for her as you became a more effective opponent."
"............So,
 ......do you think this game I\'ve made...
...is good enough to show Beato?"
"......Yes.
 ......Of course."
"...............
 ......Has Beato...
still not woken up?"
"..........................."
"It\'s been a while since her body was formed as a personification of the rules.
 Is she still not awake...?"
After remaining silent for a while longer, Genji answered.
"......She woke up three days ago.
 You were concentrating on the construction of the sixth game, so I decided to wait before telling you...
 My sincere apologies..."
"Oh, really?
 Yeah, I\'ll bet she\'s still all drowsy after sleeping so long.
 I\'ve really wanted to show her my game!
 No, it\'s more than that, I have to show her my game.
 I need to tell her that I\'ve understood everything."
Battler\'s face broke into a smile.
There was no trace in his expression of the hatred he had once felt towards Beato for murdering his family...
"......In a way,
 ...that was the final mystery of the fifth game."
"Yes.
 ......When Battler reached the truth, there was a great change in his impression of Beato."
"Does that mean it\'s fair to assume that there really was some kind of connection between Onii‐chan and Beato,
 and that he forgot all about it...?"
However, Battler suspected this in the fourth game and asked Beato about it.
And within the story,
 this was denied by the red truth:
 "Six years ago, no person called BEATRICE existed for Battler"...
"......We can read this as saying that Beato did not exist six years before,
 or it could simply mean that she had no connection to Battler at that time.
 However, either way, Battler did not visit Rokkenjima at all for the next six years..."
"October 4th, 1986 should have been the first time BEATRICE and Onii‐chan met.
 ......If so, why was there already some kind of bad blood between them?
 I don\'t have a clue what it means."
"......That "Ushiromiya Battler\'s sin", which Beato questioned Battler about in the fourth game,
 might give us a clue.
 ...The result of that might have been BEATRICE herself."
"The result?
 The result of Onii‐chan\'s sin was...Beato...?"
That almost sounds as though...
Onii‐chan created the witch called BEATRICE himself...
"Almost as though...
...BEATRICE was Battler\'s piece."
"......Huh...?"
"Six years earlier, Battler committed a sin.
 Because of that sin, people died.
 The killer was BEATRICE.
 ......If you consider the possibility that everything is connected to Battler\'s sin six years before,
 ......then the one who created BEATRICE was Battler himself.
 I thought it sounded almost as though she was Battler\'s piece..."
"I don\'t get it.
 If Onii‐chan sinned in some way, it must have been something much lighter than murder, at the very least.
 If someone caused this huge massacre in retaliation for that,
 that\'s totally out of proportion."
"Beato killed our family.
 Dad, Mom, Onii‐chan, everyone.
 ......I can\'t believe that Onii‐chan\'s sin was anything deserving of that."
"The weight of a sin depends on the person measuring it.
 Even a sin so light that Battler might have forgotten...
could have been so serious to Beato that she hated him enough to massacre his whole family a full six years after the fact."
"......Well, even I think that a bit excessive, and more importantly, if she were a person like that,
 I would find it hard to accept that Battler would act so friendly towards her after discovering the truth..."
".............................."
FEATHERINE\'s observation was extremely interesting.
In a past game,
 Beato said clearly that Onii‐chan\'s sin six years before was the cause of this two‐day tragedy.
I still don\'t know what kind of sin that was.
However, he figured it out at the end of the fifth game,
 ......and he even apologized to Beato.
Even though she was the witch who had massacred his entire family in retaliation for his sin of six years before,
 ......Battler apologized to her.
......Of course, it was the player Battler who apologized,
 not the piece Battler whose family had been murdered over and over again.
But even so, ......Battler must have remembered something at the end of the last game...
that made him feel like apologizing...
"......This sin from six years before.
 ......Does this mean that it\'s hidden somewhere in the tale so far...?"
"...I have already formed a theory about it."
"Oh?
 Let me hear it."
"Heheheheheh, I can\'t tell you yet.
 I want to enjoy being the only one who knows the answer for a little while longer..."
"......Well then, I guess I\'m done reading for you."
"Hahaha, well, we can\'t have that, can we?
 ......Have some patience and read a bit further.
 My theory is still nothing more than a guess.
 ......Once I\'m certain of it, I\'ll tell you."
"Okay, okay, my master.
 I actually do want to hear what comes next, after all."
Onii‐chan and BEATRICE...
 Just what kind of connection is there between them?
......Learning that will probably be the ultimate key to the truth of this world.
After all, remembering that...
was what enabled him to reach the truth.
"BEATRICE...!!"
"Welcome, my lord...
 BEATRICE‐sama is waiting for you.
 This way, please......"
This place was a villa set aside for BEATRICE\'s use.
It was a sacred site for her only, built so that she could spend her days without being affected by the outside world.
My heart began to race.
 ......I\'m so glad that she was able to revive...and that everything\'s okay...
Beato is a personification of the rules.
So, even though she was destroyed once, it is possible for her to be reborn again...
Battler had quickly succeeded in reviving Beato\'s body, but he had had trouble summoning her soul back.
However, during the time he had spent immersed in the creation of the sixth game, she had woken up.
 And this had happened three days ago.
Battler let himself be led into the dining hall.
The dining hall had been set up for his and Beato\'s use.
......It existed so that they could enjoy some black tea while discussing the truth, now that he had finally reached it in its entirety.
I want to tell her.
I want to tell Beato that I\'ve found the truth.
Battler couldn\'t hold back his excitement over this miracle he had been granted, that Beato was waiting for him in the dining hall to hear what he had to say...
"How is BEATRICE?
 Same as usual?
 Is she in high spirits?"
"Oh yes, she is in very high spirits now.
 She has been waiting for you all this time, my lord. Oh yes."
"Is she in the dining hall? Is she eating or something?
 Ah, that\'s alright, it doesn\'t matter either way...!"
"Hoh‐hoh‐ho, you\'ll be surprised..."
"BEATRICE...!!"
When he swung open the doors to the dining hall,
 ......Battler was greeted by a wonderful sight.
Though the food laid out on the table wasn\'t particularly sensational,
 it was arranged beautifully, and a champagne bottle stood there waiting.
......Then, ......the person clad in that familiar dress with the beautiful golden hair bowed deeply in greeting.
"......B‐......BEATRICE..."
"You have my sincerest gratitude for giving me this form."
"Ha...hahahaha...
 Come on, don\'t worry about that......
 ...I\'m so glad...
 Beato........."
Battler rushed up to Beato and hugged her tightly.
Just to make sure her body wasn\'t just mist or an illusion...
"......I...
...solved...
your riddle for you......
 But then,
 before I could tell you about it,
 you went and disappeared......"
"......I am right here...
 I will not disappear..."
"It\'s okay, you can stop talking like that.
 I\'m not going to ask you for anything in return.
 ......Anyway, I want to apologize.
 And I want to talk with you.
 ......I don\'t even know where I should start."
"You have done nothing that you need to apologize for, Father.
 ...I\'m glad just to be of service to you."
".........Beato......?"
"I was born for your sake, Father.
 Please, let me support you.
 And Father,
 congratulations on completing the sixth game."
"I told you, stop talking like that.
 It\'s totally creepy."
"......Do you find this style of speech displeasing?
 Please forgive my rudeness..."
"Well, I don\'t "find it displeasing", but it\'s not like you.
 I guess I like the way you usually talk best."
"....................."
Beato smiled vaguely.
To Battler, it probably looked as though they were both smiling over the same joke.
......However, Beato\'s smile was literally vague and uncertain.
After all...she didn\'t know how she was supposed to talk...
"Anyway, Beato.
 Just what kind of joke is this?
 Don\'t tell me that the great BEATRICE‐sama decided to cook for me...?"
"When I heard that you had completed the sixth game,
 I wanted to see if I could prepare a modest reward to congratulate you......"
"...Hoh‐hoh‐ho.
 BEATRICE‐sama really worked hard to make this.
 I didn\'t even need to lend a hand at all, no I didn\'t!"
The food set on the table really was modest and inexpertly made.
You could tell by looking at it that Beato, who wasn\'t particularly skilled with cooking, had given it her all when making it...
However, signs of discomfort and irritation were beginning to appear on Battler\'s face......
"......What...
......is this all about...?"
"Well, as she said, BEATRICE‐sama decided that she would like to congratulate......"
Sweat was starting to show up on Kumasawa\'s forehead...
......She was also feeling uneasy.
When he noticed, Battler realized that it wasn\'t just his imagination.
Beato turned her back to Battler and stuck a corkscrew into the champagne bottle.
Then, she showed it to Battler.
"Father, congratulations on the completion of the sixth game.
 In the hopes that you will prove victorious over your longtime rival, Furudo Erika..."
Pop.
When presented with a champagne bottle and a sound like that, anyone would think that the cork had been pulled out.
However, it wasn\'t the cork......it was the bottom of the bottle.
The high‐quality champagne that Beato had procured splashed out all over the floor and her dress.
Then, the same sound repeated several more times.
......Each time, one of the plates of food on the table was knocked into the air.
"F‐
......Father,
 ......did you find the food displeasing...?"
"Who......are you...?"
"...I, ......I am BEATRICE.
 ...I was born for your sake, Father..."
"No..."
"Huh...?"
"Who is this?!
 This isn\'t Beato...!!
 And don\'t call me Father...!!
 What\'s going on here?!
 What is this?!
 Didn\'t I revive Beato?!
 Genji, what\'s this all about?!!"
"......My apologies,
 but that is indeed BEATRICE‐sama."
"Like hell it is!
 How is this supposed to be Beato?!
 She\'s totally wrong, a fake!!"
"No, that is BEATRICE‐sama.
 It is, without a doubt, BEATRICE‐sama, who was born in accordance with the rules of the game board."
"No, this isn\'t anything like Beato...!!
 Beato would always talk in this weird way, she\'d laugh rudely, and more, and more...!!"
"No, this is unquestionably BEATRICE‐sama herself."
"Then why is she talking like that?
 Why is she calling me Father?!"
"B‐BEATRICE‐sama was only born a short while ago...
 It would be far too cruel to expect her to act as she once did so soon..."
"Are you saying that her memory hasn\'t returned yet?"
".........My lord.
 This person is most certainly BEATRICE‐sama herself.
 However, she is not the BEATRICE‐sama you know so well."
"What are you talking about...?!
 I\'m the Game Master, right?!
 Why can\'t I revive Beato...?!"
"Oh yes, she most certainly has revived.
 However, the old BEATRICE‐sama had lived for a thousand years.
 ......This BEATRICE‐sama, on the other hand, was only born a short while ago...!
 If she appears to be a different person, well, that just can\'t be helped...!"
"Then, ...how can I revive that Beato?!
 Her body is right here!
 How can I revive her soul?!"
"......If she lives the same thousand‐year life again, she should become the same BEATRICE‐sama she was before."
"So I\'m supposed to wait a thousand years...?!"
"A, a person\'s personality isn\'t decided solely by their birth.
 It can change drastically based on how they live and what they experience..."
"......Do you understand?
 Even though she is the same Beato, she is not the same."
"I get it.
 ......Even if you had two of the exact same person, they could change enormously depending on their upbringing."
"Even though they might both be the same human to start with, their upbringing could change them so much that they effectively become two completely different people.
 ......Usually, we use the term "person" to refer to a person, not their personality.
 However, since {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s recognize a person by their personality, they might as well be two different people, from a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} perspective..."
"......That\'s so true.
 If that tragedy twelve years ago hadn\'t happened, missy here might have been a cute girl who could smile without looking weird."
"That\'s rude.
 I\'m cute enough right now, thank you very much."
......I understand.
If a personality is what makes a person a person in our eyes,
 you could say that a second personality is a different person entirely, even if it inhabits the same flesh body.
At the very least,
 I\'m a completely different person than I used to be twelve years ago.
And if my family had come home twelve years ago,
 ......then the Ange that resulted would surely be a completely different person from me.
Even the same human can become different people.
In fact, depending on their upbringing and endless possibilities, they can become an endless number of different people.
......So, just because this is the same Beato,
 ......that\'s no guarantee at all that she\'ll be the Beato that Onii‐chan knows so well.
"And on top of that, BEATRICE is a witch who lived a thousand years.
 ......A person can die and be reborn in the span of just three days.
 A thousand years.........is just too long."
".........It seems you\'re quite a skilled reader.
 ...For most of my readers, it would be necessary to devote several hundred pages to explaining how a single human...
can become different people depending on their upbringing and the passage of time."
"Don\'t underestimate your readers.
 We aren\'t just reading.
 We read...and we think."
"......If I give my work to a hundred people to read, ninety will actually be able to.
 However, only fifty will actually understand what it means.
 And not even twenty will be capable of thinking beyond that.
 ......Yet all I am asking is that they chew before they swallow.
 ...Nothing more than that. *giggle*"
"However, it seems that "you" are one of those precious twenty readers...
 That\'s why I invited you here, child of man..."
It was hard to actually like this Hachijo Tohya person.
......However, though this forgery she had written was still in its first stages,
 ......it definitely felt as though it had something very similar to the tales in those message bottles.
Speaking metaphorically, ......one might call it a scent.
An indescribable stern atmosphere, ......like a stuffy library.
The "BEATRICE" who wrote the message bottles and Hachijo Tohya are different people.
......And yet, this has the same scent as that tale...
......I see.
 This is why some of those curious Witch Hunters are so intensely devoted to her...
Their keen sense of smell was able to sniff out that familiar scent......
"Very well then.
 ......Please continue reading.
 There could be nothing more entertaining than watching your face as you glance over the words.
 That, and speaking with you..."
"I guess it\'s true that writers are always starving for opinions on their works.
 ......Sorry to disappoint you, but I don\'t have time to read all the way through this thick manuscript.
 More importantly, I came here to............"
"......But you have all the time in the world......"
Both the second hand and the pendulum on the ornate clock behind Hachijo had been moving the whole time.
However, ......absolutely no time had passed for a while now.
Only about three minutes had gone by since the time she had entered the room...
"See?
 Time isn\'t something you have to worry about.
 ......Time everywhere will leave you alone until you\'ve finished reading..."
"................................."
"Next page, missy, next page."
Amakusa badgered me to turn the page, ......so I returned to the world of the tale once more.
......Why does her tale have the same scent as BEATRICE\'s, I wonder...
Is it because......she actually has reached the truth, as she claims?
Does this mean that anyone who knows the truth could create an endless number of message bottles?
......Is that what the cat box world is like...?
I see.
 ......Maybe she really is an Endless Witch herself.
In fact,
 ......maybe anyone who knows the truth can become an Endless Witch.
An endless tale created by Endless Witches.
The two days starting on October 4th, 1986, where my family is being toyed with endlessly.
......I have to end it.
I have to find a hint of the truth from within this story......and end this endless tale.
"What do you think, Beato?
 How\'s this sixth game I\'ve made?"
"........................"
"Well, you\'re not the type to give me an honest compliment anyway, are you...
 You\'d probably say something more like "not bad for an incompetent fool like you"."
"*cackle*cackle*.
 Not bad for an incompetent fool like you."
"Heh.
 Now that I\'ve seen what it\'s like to be a Game Master, I understand everything.
 ......You really had to work hard during each and every game."
"........................"
"‘Creating a game is not such an easy thing.
 To think the day would come when we would both congratulate each other like this.’"
"Creating a game is not such an easy thing.
 To think the day would come when we would both congratulate each other like this."
".............................."
".............................."
"......All wrong...
 ......This......isn\'t Beato..."
Battler slammed hard on the desk, but the piece Beato showed no reaction.
......After all, Battler hadn\'t ordered her to react.
It was easy to revive that Beato as a piece.
However, it would only move according to Battler\'s wishes.
......Having a conversation with it...
...was no different...
...from talking to himself......
The Game Master could summon any kind of piece.
He could move those pieces in any way he wanted, reigning as an absolute god.
......However, for that very reason,
 ......they were just pieces.
That made it unbelievably lonely...
...and sad.
"......You created many kinds of furniture, as well as several tales in the past.
 ......When I saw that, ......I was sure you were having a great time doing it."
""‘But that\'s wrong.’""
"You were......unbelievably lonely."
"‘It must have been such a relief for you to have an opponent in me who could actually go against you.
 I\'m painfully aware of that now.’"
".........That weird, polite Beato...
...she is you, I don\'t doubt that.
 ......The way you were a thousand years ago."
""‘However,
 ......she is a separate person.’""
"The way she looks just like you is what I really can\'t get over...!
 I can\'t stand it......"
"‘However, she isn\'t a piece, so she can go against my will.’"
"Sure, unlike the piece you are, that Beato is much more alive.
 I acknowledge that!
 But it\'s all wrong!!
 That isn\'t you!
 She\'s a completely separate person, like a long‐lost little sister or something!
 And that\'s why...
...I just can\'t accept her...!!"
......As much as he hated this piece Beato...
Battler felt an even stronger dislike...
...for the "chick" Beato.
Even after a whole thousand years,
 she still wouldn\'t become the original Beato.
Even if she were ordered to act like the original Beato, ......it would just be an imitation.
This was a very similar but separate person, and definitely not Beato herself.
......Then, .........in the previous game,
 ......Beato really did disappear for all eternity...
Even after becoming the Game Master,
 .........there was no way to revive her.........
"......Laugh.
 Laugh at how pathetic I am."
"............
 ......Heheheheh,
 *cackle*cackle*.
 Pfft,
 hya
hah
hahahahahhahahaaaaah!!"
Just give it a rest already......
You\'re just an illusion who won\'t laugh unless I order it...
...and who can\'t even continue to laugh unless I keep on ordering it...
 ......Just disappear!!
