"Heyyyy!!
 That\'s miiine!
 Give - it - back!!"
"Nonono, I\'m gonna eat i~t!
 Asmo, Asmo, pass!"
"Kyaahahahaha!
 Levia onee-sama, over here, over here~!"
I wonder where they swiped it from.
They were fighting over a donut or something, playing around really loudly.
"HEY!!!!!
 Ange-sama is reading, can\'t you be the slightest bit quiet?!"
"And yet you\'re the loudest one, Satan, silence yourself!!
 You cretinous sister!"
"Y-you\'re louder than me, Lucifer onee-sama!!
 I-is there something you want to say to me?!"
By now, I was used to the fights between the eldest and the third-eldest sister.
 It\'s a bit funny how they\'re both a little hesitant even though they\'re so quick to anger.
They might be surprisingly similar.
"Heh heh.
 You ordered us to be noisy, but this is surely too much.
 Should I make them lower the volume a little?"
"............You can all mess around all you want.
 It\'s a hundred times more pleasant than the shrill laughter in the classroom."
"Ange-samaa, hurry up, next paaage!
 You read really slooww!"
"You like to read, Mammon?
 You look like you\'d be the most averse to such ordinary things."
"Mammon\'s domain is greed.
 ......That also includes a thirst for knowledge.
 But she tends to want to keep that knowledge all for herself, so when someone gives her a book, she\'ll sometimes burn it after reading it so that no one else can - please watch out for that."
"I like knowing things that no one else knows.
 I like being able to do things that no one else can do.
 So I like studying and practicing.
 Because I want to keep wisdom that no one else knows about all to myself."
As Mammon said that, her eyes sparkling,
 she stared transfixed at the open page, reading through it again.
You could see the greed that made her even more intent than me on devouring that page.
As you can see, my magical power was now much stronger compared to the first day I summoned them.
I was now at the point where I could summon all of the Seven Sisters of Purgatory at once and still calmly read a book like this.
This place, although I couldn\'t recall where it was, was a quiet and calm street-side bench.
The reason that I couldn\'t remember the location of this place was that at the time I visited it, I was very young.
......Still, I remembered the day we\'d walked here, and how much fun it was.
Mom, Dad, ...and even Onii-chan had been there - 
it was a memory of a very rare and very happy day when all the family had actually been together...
The people walking by every once in a while weren\'t noticing me.
They were just pleasantly ignoring me and passing by as normal.
I wasn\'t even the slightest bit embarrassed by the Seven Sisters\' shameless outfits,
 because it wasn\'t like they were actually being seen by anyone.
In fact, I\'d gotten pretty used to them.
 Just so long as they didn\'t make me wear one.
I was sitting on a stylish bench, memorizing a timeline for world history.
......In an academy system where everything is based on collective responsibility, there\'s no tolerance for dunces.
It seemed that I was lowering the average grade for the class considerably.
According to those extremely intellectual girls,
 if I alone improved my grade, the average would rise drastically.
......They had been kind enough to show me with a graph drawn with colorful pens on a B4 sheet of drawing paper.
...Just thinking of the effort it must have taken to draw that was nauseating.
But I\'d already spat out all of those complaints.
 ......I\'d already used those girls to vent all my furious anger and sadness.
The Seven Sisters...
were sometimes outraged,
 sometimes compassionate,
 and sometimes shared in my sorrows.
......I was truly happy to have friends with whom I could share those emotions.
It\'s said that they were originally furniture that existed to carry out BEATRICE\'s cruel sacrificial ritual.
......If that sickening occult message bottle was to be believed,
 ...it seemed that several among them even attacked my family.
But I didn\'t believe that, and it would be pointless to question them about it.
They\'re furniture, so all they do is respond to their master\'s requests.
Even if they really had attacked my family, I couldn\'t hate them.
......The one I really hated...
...was the Golden Witch BEATRICE.
.........Or else the one at the very center of Rokkenjimagate,
 Aunt Eva.
"......Ange-sama, hurry up, next page."
"Oh, sorry.
 .........I\'m tired.
 Mind if I take a break?"
"Kyahaha!
 Ange-sama says she\'s having a break!"
"Let\'s play, let\'s play!
 Ange-sama, let\'s plaaaay!!"
When they noticed that I had interrupted my studying, the most energetic youngest sisters gathered around me.
That wasn\'t all.
Even Maria onee-chan and Sakutaro showed themselves.
They had probably been very close by, but they must have hid themselves so that they didn\'t interrupt my studying.
\'Uryuu!
 Ange~!
 How\'s studying? How\'s studying?\'
"Kyaaah!!
 Sakutaroo!!
 How are yooooouu?!"
"Wait a second!
 Let me fluffle him tooooooooooo!!"
"You snooze you lose, aren\'t we always telling you?!
 Kyaa, so cute, so cute!"
\'Ukyuuu, you\'re crushing meee!
 Uryuuu!\'
"Your luck ran out when you showed up when all of the Seven Sisters were gathered.
 Now accept your fate and be fluffled."
"Come on!
 Do you always have to treat him like this?!
 I apologize on behalf of my stupid sisters...!"
"Ahahahahaha.
 Sakutaro\'s happy to meet all of you too.
 ......Well, Ange?
 How\'s your studying?"
"Thanks.
 Well, not bad."
"They were nice enough to pass me a printout of the test from another class who took it earlier.
 Their beautiful sense of solidarity is enough to bring tears to my eyes.
 ......Well, at least I\'ll do a little better now for putting the timeline into my head."
\'Uryu.
 You sure are good at studying, Ange.
 You\'ll be able to get a lot of points, uryu~~.\'
"Good work.
 I was completely useless at studying, so I\'m jealous of you for being able to get a good score when you study hard."
"You\'re joking.
 English, Latin, knowledge of the occult - 
you\'re much more amazing for being able to learn all of that by heart."
"I can remember anything when studying magic, but can\'t remember anything boring I have to study.
 So it doesn\'t help at all for tests."
"Well, I\'m sure your occult knowledge would have been a bit like that, but your English and such must have translated into good grades, right?"
"In the first year of elementary school, on a Japanese language test,
 there was a question where I was given a picture of a gun and four squares, and it said to write its name in the four squares.
 Wrote "rifle" - ライフル - and got it marked wrong."
"Why?
 It fits."
"It was supposed to be てっぽう, the Japanese word for gun.
 Got told that it was wrong \'cause you don\'t learn katakana in first grade."
"......I didn\'t really get it,
 so from that day on, on tests, I wrote everything in hiragana.
 But got in trouble with Mama for some reason.
 Got in trouble with the teachers too."
".....................
 ...You probably picked the wrong country to be born in, Onee-chan."
"Then I\'d have liked to have been born in a country of witches and go to a school of witchcraft.
 Uu."
\'And then you might have had a whole lot of even more wonderful magic friends!
 Uryuu!\'
"Uu
 But it\'s not like I mind it now.
 After all, I can use a lot of magic, and I have a lot of magic friends, too.
 All I need is Sakutaro."
\'I\'m not the only one!
 There\'s also Sakusuke and Sakukichi, the animal band, Shimoda-kun the seal, Sanae-san the rabbit, Piguo-kun the pig, and plenty more!\'
......Incredible.
 Onee-chan\'s friends just keep increasing in number.
Every time I ask, the list of her friends\' names grows longer.
But there\'s no doubt that Sakutaro is her best friend.
...I\'m a little jealous of her for having such a close friend.
"......How are they?
 The Seven Sisters.
 Are you getting along with them?"
"Those sisters are really energetic.
 ......They sometimes say worrying stuff, but they aren\'t bad.
 ...What I really wanted was to get a cute kid like Sakutaro, but now, I think being with these girls is more than enough."
"*giggle*.
 If you learned my Magic of Origins more, I\'m sure you\'d be able to create just the kind of friend you\'d like, Ange.
 As it is, creation is still a little too hard for you."
"There\'s a difference between creation and summoning.
 ......And...resurrection is different still."
"...............
 So your greatest wish really is to revive your family...?"
"Yeah.
 ............I have a vessel for it.
 This."
"Yes.
 ...I\'m sure that hair accessory will become the key to summoning Battler someday.
 ......The rest is up to your training, Ange."
"Although not knowing how long that\'s going to take makes me cry."
\'Uryu...
 Stay strong, even if it\'s tough...
 If you don\'t give up, it will definitely definitely happen someday...\'
"I\'m sure I\'d feel a lot more at ease if someone would just give me some proof of that."
\'Uryu!
 Then I\'ll guarantee it!
 No doubt about it, someday, you\'ll be able to make your wish come true!\'
"......Thanks.
 I\'m happy even for consolation."
\'It\'s not consolation...uryuu.\'
"Stop it, Ange.
 That kind of emotion will become the anti-magic toxin.
 The feeling that your dreams will definitely come true is the best seed that buds into magic power."
"............
 ......You\'re right, sorry, Master."
"You need to be a bit greedier, Ange-sama.
 Go however far for the thing that you desire!
 Never give up until you get it! That\'s the willpower you\'re lacking!"
\'Uryuu!
 That isn\'t true, Ange is doing her best...!\'
"Thanks, Sakutaro, Mammon.
 Crying about it won\'t help anything.
 There\'s nothing I can do except hang in there.
 I\'ll try hard.
 Grit my teeth.
 And I\'ll definitely make my dreams come true.
 For certain."
\'Uryu!
 You\'re awesome, Ange, do your best!
 Mammon and I will support youuu!\'
"Yes, we will.
 The greedier our master is, the more our worth will increase."
"More importantly, Ange-samaa!
 We have ten whole people here, sooo..."
"We were thinking, maybe we could all play shiritori together or something!"
"Penalty if you lose!
 Let me nibble your ea~rs!"
"Come on, is there anything inside your head other than food?!"
"Please forgive my cretinous sisters\' imbecilic proposals...
 Is it really alright for you not to return to your studying about now?"
"No, no, nooooooo!!
 I waited so long for you to finish studying, you gotta play with us, you gottaaaa!"
"I don\'t think it\'s a bad idea.
 I would suggest that playing every once in a while is a good way of exercising the mind."
"............Your domain was sloth, right, Belphe?
 What you\'re saying sounds reasonable, but you\'re actually being sneaky, aren\'t you?"
"Heh.
 My apologies.
 ......You are a diligent one, Ange-sama."
"If it\'s okay with you, Ange, I\'d like to play with everyone, too.
 All noisy together.
 It\'ll definitely be fun."
\'Uryuu!
 Ange, Ange, let\'s play, let\'s play!
 Let\'s all do shiritori!\'
"In that case, let\'s start from Sakutaro\'s "uryu".
 .........What does the next word have to start with in this case?
 "Ryu"?
 "Yu"?"
"If it\'s "uryu"?
 ...............I wonder.
 Maybe it really would be "ryu"?"
"......It\'s rare for a word that ends weirdly like that to come up."
"Okay, I\'m first then!!
 I\'ll start from "ryu"!
 A "watch ste~m"!"
"I wanted to be the one to speak first!
 "Lute" would have been so much more wonderful!"
"\'Zu\'?
 Feels like we keep getting tough ones.
 ...Wait a sec, what order are we going in?
 Who\'s next?"
\'Uryu.
 I don\'t think it matters who.
 Whoever thinks of something first.\'
"Huh, that sounds fun.
 The person who can say the most wins?
 It\'s fast-talking shiritori!"
"OK, I\'ll go, then!
 "Zucchini"!
 "Garlic stir-fry"!
 "Mekabu and pasta"~!
 All of them delicious!
 Kyaha, I said three!"
"Belzie takes three points.
 ......Can you use conjunctions?"
"If you could use "and" then anything would work!!
 That last one doesn\'t count!
 Minus one point!!
 Start over at "me"."
"Okay, my turn.
 "Meringue"~!"
\'\'Ge\'??
 ...U...u...
...uryuu!\'
"\'Drainage system\',
 "reclaimed land",
 "basement".
 Something like that?"
"Onee-sama, those are all pretty unrefined words, *giggle*!"
"S-so what, why don\'t you try following up with something refined, then!!
 Anyway, that\'s three points for me.
 The next one\'s "tsu", alright, "tsu"!"
"Never played such a weird shiritori before.
 Uu-uu!
 Fun!"
\'Uryuu!
 I don\'t get it at all, but it\'s fun.
 Uryuu!\'
I\'d played normal shiritori before, but this kind of weird shiritori was a new experience for me.
The Seven Sisters, who would be lively enough just on their own; Maria onee-chan; Sakutaro; and me.
I was now surrounded by friends that were just so fun.
......The courage to accept a world of magic, a world of witches...
...That alone wouldn\'t change the fact that I was locked up in an academy,
 without a single friend in my class.
But I was having such a fun and merry time regardless.
.........I\'ll become a witch like Maria onee-chan.
And someday, I\'ll add my family to this happy circle.
Mom, Dad.
 And Onii-chan.
......If possible, George onii-chan and Jessica onee-chan, too.
 And my other relatives.
I\'ll call everyone, everyone here, without a single person missing, ...and we\'ll all be gathered together.
"......That is my...dream.
 ......Yes,
 and until I make it come true, I\'m definitely not going to lose heart."
"I\'m sure you\'ll become a Great Witch, Ange-sama.
 As long as you believe that.
 We Seven Stakes of Purgatory will always serve by your side until that day comes."
"You\'ll be there...?
 No matter how long,
 ......you\'ll lend me your strength?"
"Of course.
 After all, I\'m your friend, right, Ange-sama?"
"........................
 ......Yes, you are.
 Let\'s always stick together and play together.
 Today, and in the future...forevermore."
"Until the day you can make your dream come true."
The lively, ten-person game of shiritori,
 cut off from time alongside the street, under the forever bright warmth of the sun, continued without end......
".........What. The. Hell. Seriously, Ushiromiya-saan?"
".............................."
......In the end,
 I wasn\'t able to make a very good grade on my test.
I had thought I\'d memorized things, in my own way,
 but if you could manage anything by cramming all night like that, no one would worry about tests.
"Normally, when you know the questions beforehand, you\'d ace it easily, right? Easily!"
"It\'s true that we didn\'t go so far as to write the answers into the blanks for you.
 We thought you\'d have the sense to study at least that much."
"Oh my God!
 No frigging way. This is... God almighty...!
 They\'re almost all wrong, aren\'t they?
 Did you really actually study for this?!"
"..................More or less..."
"This isn\'t what you call more or less, Ushiromiya-san.
 ......My mind is reeling from how horrible this is."
"O Lord.
 Please forgive her for getting a miserable grade on such an easy test,
 and plummeting the average score for the entire class...!"
"*giggle*giggle*giggle*, *cackle*cackle*cackle*,
 ahahahahahahaha."
......The same test had been given to another class first.
They had managed to get hold of that test paper, so the average score for this test was unusually high.
Enough to obscure my slight improvement.
However, ......there were some things that I couldn\'t make an excuse for.
If I had spent that entire day studying like mad, I might have been able to get a slightly higher score.
......But I hadn\'t gone that far.
After all, after that on that day,
 ......I had spent the time having fun playing shiritori with the Seven Sisters, Sakutaro, and Onee-chan.
As expected, the winner had been Maria onee-chan.
She had been a strong player because of her various bits of random knowledge.
Sakutaro had gotten the penalty.
He had spent the whole time cheering for everyone else\'s answers,
 and had completely forgotten to think of any himself.
......Because of that, he got dogpiled by the Seven Sisters and had his ears thoroughly nibbled, didn\'t he?
"Excuse me, are you listening, Ushiromiya-san?!"
"..........................."
They were surrounding me, twittering like small birds.
Annoying, smelly.
On the outside of that circle was Mammon, a weary expression on her face...
"This school is as messed up as always.
 If their own grades are good, shouldn\'t they be more than happy?"
".........It\'s probably because of that collective responsibility thing.
 Instead of worrying about their own grades,
 they\'re more concerned about how embarrassing it is for the class average to be low."
"Or maybe it\'s because they really really hate the volunteer work they\'re forced to do as punishment."
"So in other words, they aren\'t studying because they want their grades to be good,
 but because of collective responsibility and because they hate volunteer work?"
"......They\'re jealous and embarrassed.
 They don\'t want to be inferior to anyone, and they don\'t want to be humiliated.
 That\'s the only feeling that drives them to study."
"What noisy people. If they want to study, why can\'t they just do it themselves?"
"In the end,
 without collective responsibility and volunteer work, they\'d have no desire to study.
 ......How foolish it is to study without knowing the meaning of studying."
"Wow, these guys are so annoying and stupid!
 Stop disturbing Ange-sama\'s precious lunchtime!"
"Waaah, I hate these guyyyys!!
 Just go awayyyyy!!"
"I\'m huuungryyyyyy!!
 Disappear already, waaaah!!"
"..................
 .........I\'m sorry, everyone.
 I wonder why Humans are so despicable."
"It\'s probably because, instead of working hard themselves,
 forcing you to put the effort in is the easier way for them to greedily boost the class average.
 ......Humans are all greedy.
 And they\'ll burden others with that to make things easier for themselves."
"...We\'ll eventually be reunited with them on the Mountain of Purgatory.
 When they get to the fifth terrace, they better watch their step..."
Mammon controls the fifth terrace of the mountain that reaches to Paradise: Mount Purgatory.
......Given that she herself was promising them this, we can probably be sure that after those girls die, their journey to heaven will not be an easy one.
...No, in fact, why don\'t they just go to hell.
The class committee had applied to the student council to use a classroom during lunch and after school.
The purpose of use was for a class study group.
 A wonderful little gathering so that they can all collect around me and make me study. I\'m overjoyed.
Which meant that every day, I would have all of my lunch and three hours of my afternoon stolen away from me.
The academy and its student council, with its motto of student self-government,
 instantly approved of this pleasant activity that the students were taking up of their own initiative...
In other words, I would no be longer able to escape after school by leaving the classroom...
After school, the first class study group meeting started right away.
Would they open a textbook, then kindly and carefully explain so that even I could understand it?
 Of course it was nothing like that naive fantasy.
After school in the classroom, around a dozen of my classmates crowded around my desk.
First, before we started studying...
Why were my grades so bad?
 What was the reason?
It was decided that we couldn\'t start until I could clearly answer those questions, become aware of the problem, and show remorse for my actions.
......Of course, there was no way I had an answer to a question like that.
They had avoided me like the plague up until now.
 And they had rejected me and kept me at a distance so as not to include me in their communities.
So I had been avoiding their communities myself.
 There shouldn\'t have been any conflict between us that way.
So even when they formed this community intent on raising the class average,
 I obviously kept well away from it.
Even if I had tried to join in,
 they would probably have ignored me, just like they had always done in the past.
"If you\'d just have asked, we\'d have taught you as much you wanted.
 Wouldn\'t weeeee?!"
"""We wouuuuuuuld!!!"""
Such enthusiasm.
 ......I\'d had enough of their ex-post-facto pretenses of charity.
"Ushiromiya-san, the thing that\'s bad about you is you\'re lacking a cooperative attitude.
 You only think about yourself - it\'s that selfish way of thinking that\'s the problem."
"Those who gather in Saint Lucia\'s place of learning shall have a cooperative heart.
 It is written right there in the student handbook, you know?"
"I think if you have a cooperative attitude,
 that\'s what gives birth to the desire to study together and contribute to the entire class.
 I think that\'s the most fundamental thing that you\'re lacking, how about you?!"
"Heeey, have you been listening to us?!
 We\'ve gone to all the trouble of staying after school to have this talk for your sake, you know?!"
.....................
The tears of gratitude are pouring down.
Of course, they didn\'t like that.
"This way, it almost makes it look like we\'re bullying you", they scolded me.
Fortunately, I\'m normally all cried out anyway.
If I\'m told not to cry, I can hold it back.
First, I was to write a letter of remorse and read it out loud.
Of course, they meant today.
The class president politely applied to the student council and the staff room for an extension on the use of the classroom.
......Apparently it was accepted right away.
Which meant that, starting now, I would be forced into self-criticism here for at least a full five hours......
 -  - I, Ushiromiya Ange, caused trouble for my classmates by getting a low score on my test.
"That\'s not iiiiiit!!"
"You getting low grades and causing us trouble isn\'t the root of the problem, right?!"
"It\'s a cooperative attitude, a cooperative attitude!!"
"Come ooon!!
 Why do we even have to guide you on how to write a letter of remorse?!"
Their abusive jeers flew about one after another.
I followed their "guidance" and put the eraser to it.
 -  - I, Ushiromiya Ange, caused trouble for my classmates by not having a cooperative attitude.
"Hey, wait a sec, it\'s pointless if you just write whatever we say!"
"Do you even frigging know what "remorse" means?!"
"It\'s pointless if you don\'t write it in your own words, pointless!"
"I\'ve always thought you were a bit strange, Ushiromiya-san, but you really are an odd one!
 *giggle*giggle*giggle*!"
Even following their guidance didn\'t change the jeers much; in fact, now it felt like they were mocking me more as well...
In this way, over the following several hours, without rest, without being allowed to go to the bathroom,
 of course without being permitted to have dinner, and while being continuously insulted...
......I was coerced into writing a document which humiliated myself......
And as it passed nine at night, ......I was told to stand up and read it aloud.
The contents...
...were smeared black with tears and eraser marks.
It certainly was my handwriting,
 ......but it was like a list of soulless letters,
 whose contents I couldn\'t even remember.
Everything had been copied down according to their guidance.
So while I had been the one to write the letters, they weren\'t my words.
I was being coerced into writing it down, and even coerced into reading it aloud.
.........I was surprised to find that even after all this time, in addition to ignoring someone and hiding their things,
 there were still other ways, like this, to bully people......
"Come onnn!
 Hurry up and read it out!!"
"Look how many people are staying this late just for you, Ushiromiya-san.
 How about a little gratitude?"
"Isn\'t the fact that she doesn\'t feel gratitude for that indicative of her not having a scrap of cooperative attitude?"
"It\'s alright, Ushiromiya-san.
 We\'ll always be with you from now on.
 Why not study with us and remake yourself?
 Okay?"
"*giggle*giggle* "Ahahahahaha "Kyahhhyahyahyahya!!"""
Still surrounded by them, I stood from my seat......and dropped my gaze towards the blackened page.
And then......I began to speak those humiliating words,
 but right away, jeers flew at me saying that they couldn\'t hear and to speak up.
...............I can\'t read this.
I had no idea...
that being forced to read a paragraph humiliating me would be so painful.
My throat shook.
 My fingertips shook.
 ......The paragraph of humiliation written in my own handwriting made my eyes burn with a hot liquid.
So my world blurred and twisted.
The girls surrounding me all appeared warped.
......I saw them warped into exactly the impression I had of them.
In other words, ......this was the correct view.
Beyond that twisted crowd of people, ......I could see my friends.
Compassion could be seen in all of their eyes.
".........Ange, .........stay strong..."
\'Uryuu.........\'
Maria onee-chan and Sakutaro were looking at me with sad eyes.
Perhaps because they realized that even cheap words of compassion would hurt me.
......They kept alternating between trying to say something, and hanging their heads.
"What the hell\'s wrong with these people...!!"
"They\'re such dirtbags!
 Really pisses me off!
 What\'s so fun about ganging up on Ange-sama and tormenting her?!"
"The resentment of not being able to spit out their jealousy.
 Anyone would do, just as long as they can spit it out.
 They\'re the worst."
"Ange-sama!
 In this kind of situation, going mad with rage for the sake of your own honor is perfectly acceptable!!
 Anger is an appropriate emotion and an appropriate reaction!
 If you don\'t get mad now, when are you going to?!!"
"Stop it, don\'t stir Ange-sama up with cheap anger!!
 If Ange-sama could do that, she would have done it already!!"
"...............If the situation could improve by you getting angry, then that is what you should do.
 However, objectively speaking, that would only serve to aggravate the situation further.
 ......It may be humiliating, but the wisest thing to do now is to withstand it."
"Ahha!
 You really are a sloth, Belphe-nee!
 Screw that, I can\'t stand this!!
 I can\'t forgive them!!"
\'...E-everyone, settle down...
 You\'re putting a burden on Ange...\'
"A burden?!
 What are you talking about? Is this the time or place to be calm?!
 We furniture are not so cruel as to be able to coolly watch our master being humiliated!!"
"Ange-sama!!
 You have no obligation to read such a humiliating essay!
 If you can\'t let out a cry of rage, then at least throw that insulting message onto the floor!!"
"You don\'t need to trash-talk them, you don\'t need to yell so loud that they bend over backwards!
 Just throw that notebook on the floor with all your might...!!
 That\'s all you need to do to show how strong-willed you are!!"
"Don\'t be so irresponsible!!
 I told you already!
 If Ange-sama could do that, she would have done so long ago!!"
"Nothing will be resolved by the eruption of momentary emotions.
 Why don\'t you understand that doing that will only worsen the criticism Ange-sama is receiving?!"
"Waaaaaaaaaaaaahh!!
 Why is this happening to Ange-sama when she didn\'t do anything wrong?!"
"Not letting her eat dinner, and making her stay so long after school! I hate iiiiiiiiiiiiit!!"
"And it\'s not just tonight, it\'s tomorrow and the day after too!!
 Give me a break! I can\'t bear this humiliation!!"
"Excuse me!! Are you actually listening to us?!"
Someone tugged at my hair.
......I was pulled back into miserable reality.
...I was no longer even permitted to listen to the Seven Sisters expressing my inner thoughts on my behalf.
My hair was lifted upwards, one of my hair ornaments came off, and I heard it bounce and then roll on the ground.
......No one picked it up.
To the contrary, they casually avoided it as though something filthy had come rolling towards them.
I tried to follow it with my eyes, but my hair was tugged upwards again.
"Why is it that you\'re never listening, even though we\'re trying to have a real serious talk with you?!"
"In one ear and out the other, is it?
 Or maybe we\'re talking to a brick wall?!
 Get a grip, alright?!"
"Are you really conscious of the trouble you\'re causing all of us?
 You better not be about to say you just wrote that grudgingly because we told you to!"
"Until you can really feel remorse by yourself, this seriously isn\'t gonna end, get it?!
 It\'s not just gonna be today.
 This is seriously gonna keep on going tomorrow and the day after, you got that?!
 I\'m warning you, don\'t push your luck with us!!"
"Like, more to the point, what are you even still alive for?
 Could you guys go on like this?
 If it were me, I\'d just die!"
"Yeah, I could never live this way!
 Think about it, just by being alive, you\'d be getting in other people\'s way all the time, right?
 If it were me, I definitely couldn\'t live on!"
"Yeah, yeah, I\'d die too.
 If that\'s better for the world, I\'d die on the spot! Wouldn\'t yooooou?!!"
......Then die.
"Ange-sama......"
"Kill them all, immediately!!
 Lucifer, did you hear me?!"
"Huh?! ......Ah..."
"You Seven Sisters of Purgatory are incredible furniture that can massacre mere Humans in a flash, right?!
 You\'re always boasting about it to me!!"
"Then do it!
 Kill them all right now!!
 Right here, right now!!"
".........But..............."
For some reason, Lucifer\'s speech faltered.
"......Why?
 What\'s wrong?!
 You\'re certain-kill furniture that can fly around faster than the eye can see, and instantly strike through the hearts of the witch\'s enemies, aren\'t you?
 And I am giving you an order as your master!!"
"Carry it out right away!
 Kill them!!
 KILL THEM AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALL!!"
"........................A-Ange-sama......
 ...Please, calm down......"
If they had immediately followed my brutal order, and left corpses strewn all around me...
......I would have been ready to rue my own reckless actions of stealing human lives so readily - I was ready to regret and feel remorse, just as they had wanted me to.
I was prepared to go through that.
And yet, Lucifer just let an unsure expression rise to her face, and didn\'t move to carry out my order.
..................I was aware.
Of course I was.
 ......Vaguely.
No, that\'s not it.
 ......I knew it from the very beginning.
I knew, didn\'t I......that magic was all empty......
"......The Seven Sisters of Purgatory? Yeah, right...
 ......Worthless, worthless...
 ............I knew it from the very beginning......"
"............A-......Ange-sama...
 ............g - ... -  -  -  - ......!!!"
I glared into the worthless Lucifer\'s eyes.
...And it seemed that pain accompanied that stare.
As though she had been struck by a horrendous headache, Lucifer clutched her head with both hands.
But it looked like she couldn\'t tear her eyes off my glare.
......So the pain assaulting her grew more and more intense.
"......................................."
"Guhgggg, a......ghhhgaaa, agaa.........!!
 Ahghhk!!!"
You are useless, useless......!!
 I HATE you!!
 Disappear...!!
 You\'re nothing but a delusion inside my head...!!!
Hopelessness and disappointment.
 Resignation and a dream\'s end.
 A cracking sound, like you\'d hear from a frozen lake\'s surface during a fierce winter, rang out just once.
Simultaneously, Lucifer\'s form, tormented by violent pain, stiffened in place and grew cloudy.
......It was almost as though a beautifully polished glass window...
had been heartlessly smashed and turned white from the countless cracks.
And that was an accurate analogy.
 At some point, Lucifer\'s form had turned into a glass ornament of the same shape.
Countless fissures ran through it from the inside, and the head and arms fell to pieces as it crumbled to the floor.
"Hiiyii?!!"
"L-Luci-nee...!!"
"............Who\'s the second sister...?
 Leviathan?
 Carry out my order.
 Kill them all right NOW!!"
"W-well, um!
 ......Err, Ange-sama...
 ......Please calm your heart and listen...
 We, umm,
 ......... -  -  - ...
mmgwaaGHHggggggah -  - 
GAHAGH!!"
I\'m not looking for excuses or back talk or a reply.
......I want nothing more than a swift confirmation of my order to eradicate the girls who are humiliating me.
If you\'re going to say anything else, there\'s no need for me to listen until the end.
After Leviathan turned white from the vast number of cracks throughout her whole body,
 frozen in a bent-backwards pose, she toppled over, and her fragile neck, hips and arms broke into separate parts.
It would have been less brutal if they had just smashed to smithereens instead of retaining their original form.
So the fact that I had left the two of them partially intact...
made the remaining younger sisters shake even harder...
"......Why won\'t you listen to my orders...?
 Why?
 WHY?!!"
"M-my apologies...!!
 H-here, under the current conditions, the anti-magic power is...e-extremely strong...and - "
"What.
 You can\'t do it because Humans are here? That\'s your logic?
 Isn\'t killing Humans what you do?!
 If you can\'t do that, then WHAT USE are you as furniture?!!
 DIE!!!"
"Hiii - !!"
"P-please, spare me, Ange-samaaaaa......ah,
 nghk,
 ghhgaaaah, khack!!"
As she clutched her head with both arms, Satan also turned white and fell down face first.
The neck really did seem to be the most fragile part.
Her head broke off weightily and rolled over to Belphegor\'s feet.
"You can\'t do it because there are too many Humans?
 Then if I were to call them into the shadows later one by one,
 you\'re saying you guys could make a bloodbath of all of them?"
"......With your current magical power, it may be easy for you to converse with us.
 However, you still lack the training in magical power to manifest us in front of all of the Humans here...!"
"I deeply understand your anger, but even if you could use us to attack,
 murdering everyone here would only make the situation worse...!
 I do think it humiliating, but please, if you could control your anger for the time being - "
".........ggg, gah,
 ......ghhhhh...ggg...gaHAGHHH!!"
"...............Will I get the same answer from the remaining three...?
 Going to tell me you can\'t do it because the anti-magic power is too great?
 Going to tell me you can\'t do it because my magical power is too weak?"
"......Then I won\'t ask you to kill all of them.
 Let\'s see you just kill one.
 Right here, right now...!!"
As Asmodeus and Beelzebub held each other, they crouched down, cringing in fear under my glare.
......If they had been able to obey my order, they would probably have carried it out immediately.
And yet, here they were crouching down.
......Empty.
 Sad.
 And pathetic......
That\'s right - I knew it.
 These girls can\'t touch reality with even a single one of their fingers......
"N-...no, no...!!
 Belzie, I\'m scared, Belzieeeee!!"
"Ange-sama, spare us, spare us...!!
 I don\'t want to diiiiiiiieee!!"
"Die, useless furniture!
 Why are you guys even alive?
 Why are you alive when your lives are worthless?
 You could just die.
 Die, please.
 Drop fucking dead!!
 Do you think there\'s anyone stupid enough to leave furniture lying around without a use?!"
""HiiiIiiI!!
  -  -  -  - gaaahh!!!""
"P-please stop, Ange-sama!!"
"......What is it, Mammon?
 Will you be the only one to fulfill my order?
 Of course you will.
 You\'re my best friend.
 ............You alone will do what the others wouldn\'t...
and kill them!"
"............A-as you are now, Ange-sama, ......even if you use us, you\'re not capable of committing murder!!
 It is the duty of furniture to help with things its master can do...!"
"Things that even the master can\'t do, we can\'t do...!!
 Do you hate these girls, Ange-sama?
 You hate them, don\'t you?"
"I understand why you want to kill them, really, I do!!
 Alright, in that case, let\'s go ahead and kill them, Ange-sama!
 If you will stain your own hands with blood, then we, the Seven Sisters of Purgatory, will go along with you however far! However far!!"
"......I\'m......asking you guys.........because I can\'t do it myself, aren\'t I......
 ......Isn\'t being able to do things I can\'t...the thing that makes you furniture?!!"
"Yes, we are furniture.
 Furniture to be used...!!"
"Please, go ahead and use us to kill!
 You\'ll be the one killing, Ange-sama!!
 If you\'re saying that you want to kill, then go ahead, be my guest!
 No need to hesitate, please, go and carry it out right now!!"
"And once you have that level of mental resolve,
 once you\'re prepared to dirty your own hands - then, we will help you!
 But you haven\'t reached that stage!!"
"Pft, .........heheheheh, ahahahahaha...
 Ahahahahahahahaha, don\'t speak, you furniture.
 You DELUSION!!"
"I get it already, don\'t make me say it all out loud.
 ...You guys can\'t do anything.
 You are nothing more than my delusions, illusions, daydreams...!"
"I haven\'t had a single friend from the very beginning.
 You\'re just a phantom, a pretend friend lonely old me created inside my heart, aren\'t you?
 I knew that - from the very beginning!!!"
"Ahhahahahahahahahahahaha!!
 Yes, that\'s right!
 We\'re a fantasy inside your head, got a problem with that?
 Yes, it\'s truuue!"
"We\'re just imaginary friends,
 created to soothe lonely, lonely Ange-sama\'s heart because she doesn\'t have a single solitary friend, wanna say something about it?"
"If you want to look at reality, just look at it.
 Stop looking at us and go back to being yourself over there, completely boxed in and bombarded with abuse!!"
"Go on then, go on, back you go, back to reality!!
 Just call on us only when it\'s convenient for you and pretend you have friends,
 set us on your enemies when you don\'t have the guts to dirty your own hands, and deny and erase us once you realize that\'s not gonna work!"
"Yes, I\'ll leave with a shriek of anguish just like you want, go ahead and enjoy it!!"
"Just copy the jeering that you\'re being bombarded with right now,
 and do the same to us to get it off your chest."
"That too is the duty of furniture!!
 Getting slammed against the floor when someone\'s pissed off is also a chair\'s important duty!!"
"If by that trifling service we manage to absorb our master\'s bad mood even for an instant,
 there can be no greater honor for furniture.
 Kill me, deny me, your first and final friend...!!!!!!!"
At the end, Mammon had a derisive expression on her face,
 ......but for some reason it looked like teardrops had scattered from her eyes.
Mammon, Beelzebub and Asmodeus smashed to pieces and rolled across the floor......
\'.........U-......uryu..................\'
"..................
 Come over here, Sakutaro.
 Ange is just a little agitated right now.
 ......So you mustn\'t get close."
\'What about the others?
 Are the Seven Sisters alive?
 Did they die...?\'
"......It\'s alright.
 It looks very gruesome, but those are the remains of their vessels after they were forcibly evicted from the human world.
 They\'re shells that have been shed."
"......So it\'s alright.
 They\'re probably deeply hurt, but they\'re safe.
 They\'re all alive.
 I\'m sure we\'ll be able to meet them again someday."
\'Uryu...
 ......Thank goodness..........thank goodness............\'
"......Ange, you violated the treaty of Mariage Sorciere.
 ......Doing such a horrible thing, ......even though witches of the alliance must respect and accept one another......
 They were all your precious friends......"
"No witches\' alliance has anything to do with this.
 Magic friends? Give me a break.
 .........I killed them, erased them.
 I smashed the Seven Sisters!"
\'Uryu......that\'s so cruel......so cruel.........\'
"......Just give it a rest with this playing witches thing.
 .....Please.
 Maria onee-chan and Sakutaro, I want you to disappear by yourselves.
 .........Because even amid my delusions, ......I don\'t want to kill or erase you."
\'W-...we aren\'t delusions......
 We\'re your friends, Ange... Uryu.........!\'
Sakutaro sobbed those words as he hid behind Maria onee-chan.
.........Sakutaro doesn\'t exist.
Sakutaro is also...a delusion Onee-chan created to distract herself from her loneliness.........
\'U-......uryu, .........it hurts, ......it hurts, Maria......
 ......Why? Why...?
 Uryu.........uryu.........\'
"Stop it.
 Denying my friend is the one thing I will not permit."
The same power that had smashed the Seven Sisters was probably eating into Sakutaro as well.
......But Maria onee-chan was apparently protecting him with some other power.
So Sakutaro\'s form didn\'t break or scatter.
Onee-chan glared at me sharply.
......A serious expression that she had never shown me before.
"Sakutaro is my furniture.
 You cannot erase him, Ange.
 ......That you would try to deny him regardless is the greatest contempt you could show a witch."
"Sakutaro never existed in the first place.
 He\'s just a lion stuffed animal.
 Just a phantom you personified in the delusions inside your own mind!"
"Uu!!!
 That\'s not true!!
 Sakutaro is my friend!!
 He was a stuffed animal once, but now he isn\'t!!"
"No, he\'s a stuffed animal.
 A stuffed animal made of cloth and cotton!
 He can\'t move or talk by himself!
 You\'re just talking for him like a ventriloquist!"
"Is that what you call magic?
 Is that what you call a witch?!
 Is that what you call......a friend?!
 I can\'t accept that!!"
\'........................Uryu......
 .........Am I...
......not me......?\'
\'......Am I......just a stuffed animal that...
can\'t really talk and...
.........not your...
...friend...
............after all............?\'
\'U......ryu.........\'
As though plagued by a high fever, Sakutaro weakened bit by bit.
As he clung to Onee-chan\'s body, he did all he could to continue standing,
 ......but his body began to slip down bit by bit...
As he did, Onee-chan held him, and screamed at me as tears streamed down her face...
"Uuuu!!
 Stop iiiit!!
 Don\'t burn Sakutaro with the anti-magic toxin!!
 Don\'t bully him!!
 Don\'t insult him!
 Don\'t deny him!!!!!"
"*giggle*giggle*!!
 Maria onee-chan, you\'re weeeeird!!
 There is no Sakutaro~!
 Stuffed animals are stuffed anima~ls!"
"I learned from Mama that they\'re made of cloth and cotton~!!
 There\'s no way they can walk or tal~k!!
 *giggle*giggle*giggle*, *giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*!!!"
\'.........Uryu........................u...yu...............\'
"Sakutaro!!
 Sakutaroo!!!
 He\'s not a stuffed animal, he\'s not a stuffed animal, he\'s a friend!!
 Uuu!!!
 WaaaAAAaaaAaaaahhhh!!!!"
"*giggle*giggle*giggle*!!
 *giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*!!
 I don\'t wanna play with stupid animals, let\'s all play outsi~de!!
 I\'m bored with animals no~w!!
 *giggle*giggle*giggle*!!"
"NO, you\'re not my friend any more!!
 Uu!!
 Why would you say that, I hate you I hate you I hate you I hate you!!
 I HATE YOU!!"
You\'re not my friend!!
 I won\'t let you be one of us witches anymore...!!
Upon my name, the Apprentice Witch of Origins MARIA,
 I hereby expel the apprentice witch ANGE from the Mariage Sorciere Alliance of Witches......!!
.........And then.
...Those tranquil days of mine, now merely a waking dream, came to an end.
At this point, it\'s unverifiable.
No one can verify whether that really was magic, and those really were my friends,
 or else whether it was all nothing more than a daydream.
......I, the sole observer, concluded that those girls were a figment of my imagination.
......So that became the truth.
Perhaps, further in the future, I will observe it again, and when that happens, maybe I will acknowledge that it wasn\'t a dream,
 ......that the Seven Sisters really were my friends, and that along with Maria onee-chan and Sakutaro,
 they did everything they could for me in my isolation.
..................Something so vague is neither the truth nor even an illusion.
Maybe the reality that\'s here and now is the only real world, with the real me.
Where is the real me?
The person standing among the girls\' shameful remains resembling broken glass sculptures,
 breathing harshly and shoulders heaving, ...that is not me.
The place I am......is over there.
The one boxed in by a crowd, the one being subjected to constant verbal abuse, ...the one hanging her head, with clearly red eyes.........
......The me over there,
 .........isn\'t that the real me......?
I won\'t...dream...anymore.
Because there\'s nowhere...for me to run.
I\'ll...go back.
 ......I\'ll return myself...to the cage made of flesh......
"Hey!!
 Are you listening to us?!
 Standing there hanging your head forever won\'t solve anything, you know?!"
"..............................
 ......I hear you."
"Ah, you finally answered.
 Are you thinking that this\'ll end eventually if you just stay silent, or that we\'ll forgive you if you cry, or something like that?!
 We\'re asking if you are aware!
 We\'re asking if you are aware of the trouble you\'re causing those around you...!!"
.........I...slowly nodded.
 ...I admitted it.
I admitted that I had been spending my time in a waking dreamland, trying to remain separate from the others in my class.
......Those "friends" who had spoken to me with such kind and hopeful words,
 yet who couldn\'t offer me any help at all now in the moment I truly wanted it - 
to move on from them and to sully them,
 ......I admitted it.
"...I, Ushiromiya Ange, caused trouble for my classmates by not having a cooperative attitude.
 The reason for it is nothing more or less than my excessive inferiority complex towards all of my classmates because of my inability to study.
 And.............................."
".........there\'s no point in me being alive."
Starting there, I was no longer reading the paragraph they had made me write.
......It was my...improvisation.
 And...what was in my heart.
They also noticed that it wasn\'t what they had anticipated,
 but while they did frown, no one spoke.
So I continued.
"......That\'s right.
 There was no point in my life continuing.
 ......I was meant to have been taken with them on that day in 1986.
 ......And yet, I was the only one who didn\'t get to be taken."
"......Why am I here, I wonder?
 ...This isn\'t the world I\'m meant to be in.
 ............No one will save me here."
"...For a time, ......I felt as though the fictional friends I created inside myself would save me.
 But those friends were nothing more than a delusion, ......and they did no such thing.
 After all, this isn\'t a fantasy world - it\'s the real world."
".........So, in short, ......up until today, ......I\'ve been living in a daydream.
 ...Averse to my real classmates, I lived only by interacting with the friends in my delusion.
 .........Just now, I split up with those friends.
 And here I am."
"............I have no family.
 I\'ve discarded my friends.
 ......There is no longer anything left for me."
"......Why haven\'t I died?
 One of you asked me that just now.
 ...I think you\'re absolutely right.
 Why.........am I alive, I wonder?
 ..................I should have been dead............in 1986.
 ...No, I did die then, I\'m sure of it."
"But even so, ............my soul that was killed is still locked up inside this cage of flesh.
 So I\'ll ask this of one of you.
 If no one responds, ......I\'ll do it myself."
"Someone,
 .....................please let me die."
I spoke that sentence, and looked around.
Dumbfounded girls.
Shocked girls.
Girls who looked like they didn\'t know what this kid was saying.
And, after a small delay,
 more and more girls with faces that said "Is this kid alright?"
Whisper whisper.
 Mutter mutter.
 And then, giggle giggle.
.........When I ordered my friends in my daydream to kill, they couldn\'t do it.
And so,
 I asked real Humans to kill,
 ......but of course, these girls can\'t do it either.
......In other words, both daydreams and reality are the same.
Doesn\'t that mean that everything, absolutely everything, this world included...
............is all a daydream?
Then......what\'s the problem.
After all, ......on that day when I lost my entire family, ...I already died.
......All the days since have been the delusions of a wrongful survivor - delusions of a life flashing before my eyes.
Once I understood that, ...............it felt like all the scenery surrounding me began to twist and bend slightly.
.........Ah.
...I\'m finally going to.........wake up.
...I\'m going to be released...from this world of waking dreams.
I felt my consciousness sliding away.
......That\'s alright.
 Fade further and further away, ............and take me to my family......
Therefore, no matter what unfolded in this twisted, faded world, I paid it no mind at all.
I saw the crowd get pushed aside as a teacher stepped in.
Perhaps a teacher doing the rounds happened to notice a strange disturbance.
The teacher was vigorously shouting something, moving to protect me.
......Upon seeing that, and learning that an ally had appeared for me, even if only one,
 I felt my awareness return very slightly.
..................
......The only ones who can save me in the real world...are real Humans.
Never again.
 ......Never again will I seek salvation from daydreams.
.........This is the Human world.
The only ones who can save a Human...are other Humans......
"...........................
 ......Yes.
 If that\'s what you think, then that\'s your world, Ange."
\'......Can Ange...
...become happy this way.........?\'
".........If Ange believes that is the only way to become happy, then it is the only way.
 ...If she cannot accept the blue bird in the cage for what it is,
 ...then she must go and search forever."
\'Uryu......
 ...Maria, are you......breaking off relations with Ange.........?\'
"..............................
 ......No, nothing like that.
 I only did that because it was what Ange wanted.
 ......We witches are sometimes persecuted.
 However, we are always close by.
 ......And our aid will surely be sought."
\'......Will the day come.........when Ange will play with us again......?\'
"It may be that it never comes, and we will simply be forgotten.
 ...In the human world, they call that growing up, or moving on.
 ............Still."
If Ange just remembers, we will always be by her side.
......And until then, ......we will be waiting.
