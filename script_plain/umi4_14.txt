The clinic that Nanjo had opened and later passed on to his son still existed on Niijima.
The aged doctor was Nanjo\'s son, but the atmosphere about him was very different.
"I am truly sorry to say this after you have come all this way, but I have nothing in particular to tell you."
Nanjo\'s son spoke very indifferently.
"......After the accident on that island was taken up by the talk shows in a most indiscreet manner,
 there was a great deal of deeply offensive probing into my father, who was Mr. Ushiromiya\'s doctor and friend."
"All of it was without proof, and also, defiled all of my father\'s previous achievements.
 I still feel a great deal of resentment towards all of that."
"............I think that\'s understandable.
 It\'s been pretty much the same for me.
 Constantly since I was six."
"True.
 My apologies."
The doctor finally remembered that Ange was also a victim, exposed to the same curious eyes as he had been.
"In that case, you can probably understand why I want nothing more to do with that incident.
 ......That was an unfortunate accident.
 The only ones who want to make a fuss about it being a crime are the irresponsible TV shows and magazines.
 I am more than fed up with their attitude."
.........Nanjo had been placed in the spotlight for being one of Ushiromiya Kinzo\'s few friends.
Because of that, there had probably been a persistent offensive from the Witch Hunters and the press to use the late Nanjo\'s son as well as a source of information.
......The doctor went on and on, criticizing the press indignantly.
"I really understand how you feel.
 My personal life was put under surveillance,
 and I had no privacy, no portrait rights, heck, I don\'t know if I was even afforded human rights.
 So I deeply empathize with your pent‐up anger."
".........And for that very reason, I want to know, more than anything else, what in the world was that incident that so thoroughly ruined my life.
 That\'s why I came here."
".........I\'m a related party just like you.
 Not a magazine columnist or an interviewer.
 Please, don\'t get the wrong idea."
"I didn\'t come to do this for fun.
 ......And I\'d very much appreciate it if you stopped looking down on me.
 If we\'re going to do a comparison of whose life was most screwed up by that incident, you won\'t even come close."
"............mgh......"
Ange spoke sharply.
Never having imagined that he would be talked back to in such a forceful manner, the doctor couldn\'t help but fall silent.
......From Ange\'s perspective, the doctor was whining about absolutely nothing.
She really wanted him to pack in his patronizing attitude.
 It was about time to make him understand how many days had passed for her before arriving on this island.
The doctor realized that he had misspoken, and remained silent for a while, looking uncomfortable.
"I know it\'s probably painful to remember what happened at the time, but if there\'s anything you do know, please tell me, no matter what it is.
 Of course, I\'ll tell no one."
"I visited here today to bring some closure to my life.
 ......I\'m eighteen.
 That incident took away twelve years of my life.
 And it\'ll probably keep on taking."
"......I was thrown into darkness when I was six years old and I\'ve never gotten out.
 Are you still going to tell me I have no right to know...?"
".........No, ...I\'m sorry.
 It seems that since all the others who came were ill‐natured folk, I instinctively put up my guard.
 I apologize for my rudeness."
"......Alright.
 If you\'ll swear not to breathe a word of this to anyone, I\'ll tell you everything."
"Thank you, Doctor.
 ......Then, if you would.
 Please tell me anything you can."
"......As you know, my father was not only Mr. Ushiromiya\'s personal physician, but his friend through the game of chess.
 That relationship was very long, stretching back to the time Mr. Ushiromiya moved to Rokkenjima."
"Just how close were they?"
"Considerably, it seems.
 It seems that their connection through chess led my father to stay at Mr. Ushiromiya\'s mansion quite often."
"......I am not sure it is right of me to say this, but Mr. Ushiromiya was extremely moody.
 And my father was an exceedingly magnanimous man, who excelled at interacting with people like him.
 It\'s not hard to imagine that he was a rare friend for the isolated Mr. Ushiromiya."
"That day was the day of the family conference.
 ......The Ushiromiya family conferences are said to have involved harsh questioning from Ushiromiya Kinzo over how his fortune would be put to use,
 almost like a financial conference.
 So Doctor Nanjo had gained a trust so great that he was asked to attend even that...?"
"My father was a simple doctor,
 so I cannot imagine that he was in a position to advise on asset management for a millionaire family like the Ushiromiyas."
"He was most likely called there to assist, because Mr. Ushiromiya\'s health was not at its best at the time.
 ......As Mr. Ushiromiya\'s close friend, I\'m sure that my father would have kept his mouth shut, and been trusted not to leak the secrets of the family conference."
"......Was Ushiromiya Kinzo in very bad health at the time?
 Are there any medical charts left?"
"My father probably took the medical charts with him on the day of the accident.
 I\'m afraid to say that the entire folder of Mr. Ushiromiya\'s medical charts has been lost.
 He was my father\'s patient, so I don\'t know the details either."
"Around the time of the incident.
 Was there anything you thought was strange?"
".....................
 ......Well, there was...
 ......However, it seems exceedingly likely to result in a misunderstanding, so I don\'t particularly want to talk about it."
"......What is it?
 Please tell me."
For a while, the doctor beat around the bush,
 but after he\'d said that much, Ange would not allow the subject to be dodged.
Eventually, he was worn down, and after making Ange swear herself to secrecy again, he opened up......
"The truth is, several days after that accident, I received something by mail at my home."
".........Mail?"
"It was very curious.
 The sender was made out to be me, but I had no memory of it.
 Someone had sent it in my name."
"The destination was Rebun Island in Hokkaido.
 ......It\'s at the northernmost tip of Japan, excluding the Northern Territories.
 The recipient\'s address was on Rebun Island, but.........
the name was my father\'s."
"......However, it seems there was a problem with the destination address, so it had received an "Address Unknown" label,
 and been returned to the sender, "me"."
It was...truly a strange tale.
Nanjo\'s son\'s name was written as the sender.
......However, he said that he hadn\'t mailed the letter.
In short, that meant someone had sent it using his name.
The destination was "Nanjo Terumasa", on Hokkaido\'s Rebun Island.
But the lot number written on it didn\'t exist,
 so the local post office had been unable to deliver it, and instead sent it back to "the sender, Nanjo\'s son"......
"......What was inside?"
"...........................
 ......I truly ask that you keep silent about this.
 I am by no means pleased to have received this.
 Even so, I can hardly throw it away......"
The doctor stood up and headed for the bookshelf.
There, dozens of dictionaries that could only have been ornamental were lined up one after another,
 asserting in the strongest way imaginable that the owner was an intellectual.
When he pulled several volumes out from there, a large, brown envelope was hidden behind them.
He took it out and tossed it onto the desk.
It had been been carefully sealed with adhesive tape,
 and its faded color and dryness told that it had remained sealed for twelve whole years......
"Most sincerely, .........I ask for your silence."
While emphasizing it so much it was annoying, the doctor removed the seal with a quality paper knife.
......Then, when he tilted the envelope, an already opened mail envelope spilled out.
The envelope had weight to it, hinting that there was something other than a letter inside.
.........The recipient...was certainly Nanjo Terumasa.
Even seeing that......was a huge shock.
After that incident, Nanjo\'s corpse had not been found, and he was being treated as dead in absentia under extraordinary circumstances.
......And despite that, this letter addressed to a Nanjo in Hokkaido existed.
One could almost take this as a sign that he had faked his own death and escaped to Hokkaido.
"......Was Doctor Nanjo really in Hokkaido?
 Or was there another person there with the same first and last names?"
"If my father had somehow escaped from the accident and was living on in Hokkaido,
 that would have made our family very happy, regardless of the situation."
"I also thought of that possibility at first.
 ......However, the destination address of this envelope does not exist.
 In short, this envelope was mail that had no way of reaching him."
"............Is there a possibility that the sender miswrote the correct address?"
"Of course, I cannot disprove that.
 However, judging from the residence\'s house number, I find that hard to believe."
".........
Hokkaido,
 Rebun Island,
 Rebun County,
 Rebun City,
 1‐2‐34‐567.
 ....................."
Up until Rebun City, it\'s alright.
...But I just couldn\'t wipe away the feeling that following sequential number, 1234567, was a little insincere.
It felt like a fake address that some kid had made up.
"They probably just randomly wrote some clearly nonexistent address.
 I think it\'s natural to assume that, from the very beginning, this envelope was sent to a nonexistent address to which it had no chance of being delivered."
If the destination address doesn\'t exist, mail is generally returned to the sender.
But even in the case of a faulty address, the local post office will often courteously,
 and to the best of its ability, research to find whether the sender\'s intended destination exists.
When they still can\'t find it, the mail is sometimes returned after an investigation of several days.
It seemed that this was what had happened with this envelope, and the stamp was postmarked October 3rd.
It was postmarked on Niijima.
Niijima is a long way away from Rebun Island.
On top of that, the destination was also nonsensical.
......It had taken more than a week for the mail to be returned.
......In other words, there was an extremely high chance that having this envelope returned to the sender after an indeterminate amount of time...
had been the goal from the very beginning.
Why do something like that.........?
Even before asking what it was that had been sent, this envelope was already veiled in mystery......
"..................And inside it?"
"Go ahead."
After getting the doctor\'s permission, I tilted the already opened envelope.
From the inside came a small, folded letter, and a small key with a number tag attached.
 A swipe card slid out in addition.
A112 was engraved on the key\'s number tag.
......I didn\'t know what it meant.
The swipe card was pitch black and had gold letters engraved on it.
"MEMBERS" was written there in English.
 The jet‐black, gold‐lettered card design made it feel like something very high‐class.
......But of course, I didn\'t have a clue what kind of card it was just from that.
......I unfolded the letter.
Its contents were extremely brief, and only the following was written:
07151129.
And the name of a certain massive bank known throughout Japan, as well as the words "Central Branch".
......That was all.
"What\'s this.........?"
"...............
 .........It\'s a card, a key, and a PIN for a safe‐deposit box.
 And it wasn\'t a normal safe‐deposit box either.
 It was an unsettling one, which was apparently reserved only for special clients."
After he had finished putting his affairs in order following his father\'s funeral, he visited the bank.
......PIN and key and card.
 There was no doubt that something of great importance was stored there,
 and it was natural that he was curious about what that could be.
At first, he didn\'t know what to do.
......The card wasn\'t properly his possession.
When he mustered up his courage and showed the card to a bank clerk, he was then switched to a clerk of clearly high status, and was guided to a large vault on the fourth basement floor.
The security on the way there was strict.
The doctor had himself stored valuable items such as real estate transcripts in safe‐deposit boxes before,
 but this was something on a whole different level......
"......Unlike the procedure at the deposit box I use,
 their system didn\'t carry out any identity checks so long as you had a card, a PIN, and a key."
"......But, in any case, it was a very secure vault, and I was frightened by how imposing it was.
 ......I wondered what kind of shady objects might await me that had to be stored in a place like this."
"............And so?"
"When I passed the card through the reader, I was asked to input the PIN.
 And after that eight digit number was input and authenticated, I was permitted access to the vault."
"......It was an incredible scene.
 A world like something from a sci‐fi movie.
 That massive, dimly lit silver room was covered with doors to safes."
He entered that room along with the clerk.
As soon as the card was read, the vaults he had a right to were apparently determined,
 so that safes he could open were lit with a green light, while those he couldn\'t open were lit with a red one.
"A112 indicated one of those safes.
 ......By the way, there was a long line of other safes marked with a green lamp besides that one.
 I think there were at least twenty."
"There might even have been more in other corners of the room.
 ......In any event, I only had the key to A112.
 I had no way of checking the contents of the other safes."
As the clerk watched, the doctor unlocked and opened the safe.
When he did, a safe drawer like a large cabinet opened,
 ......and an expensive‐looking duralumin case showed itself...
That was carried into a separate room, where for the first time, the clerk left, and he was introduced to the contents......
"And the contents were.........?"
"........................
 ............Cash."
"Cash?
 How much?"
"I have heard that a pack of one million yen in fresh banknotes is precisely one centimeter thick.
 Since those were.........packed tightly into a duralumin case of such a size..."
"......There was probably a hundred million total.
 I don\'t know, because I didn\'t count.
 I didn\'t even touch it with my hands.
 I realized at once.
 This was dangerous money."
It isn\'t normal to store a whole hundred million yen in cash in a safe like that, case and all.
......It\'s much easier to deal with if you deposit it into a bank account and turn it into a number.
The very fact that they were unable to do that made it clear that there was something wrong with that cash......
"......My mind went blank, and I instantly realized that I must not get involved."
"And you didn\'t use it at all?"
"Yes.
 I locked it straight back up, returned it to the original safe, and left.
 ......I have thought about throwing away that key and card, but I have no idea what might happen.
 For that reason, I\'ve been hiding it in the back of the bookcase, a secret from everyone, for a full twelve years.
 .........I still don\'t know what kind of money that was."
"......Could I borrow this envelope?"
"No.
 Please just view it here."
".....................
 ......Alright.
 Then if I may.
 There\'s something I want to investigate."
I took Onee‐chan\'s grimoire from the knapsack I had set down.
......Then I opened to the page with the paragraph BEATRICE had written to Onee‐chan, and compared the handwriting on both......
"..................................................."
............The characteristic handwriting was unmistakable.
 The one who had sent this hundred million yen in cash............was BEATRICE herself......
But, .........what is it...
 Something\'s bugging me......
What is it.........
 What is it.........
".........Y‐......yeah.
 I\'m pretty sure I got something like that in the mail.
 Hey Ma, where\'d I put that again?!"
The same envelope and contents had been sent to Kumasawa\'s son, who had once lived with her.
But he had been very busy in the days since, and seemed to have forgotten about it among the hustle and bustle of everyday life.
But apparently, its strange contents had stayed in his memory, and he remembered as soon as Ange told him......
After a bit of a wait,
 his thin‐lipped wife came with the envelope, complaining that he always forgets where he puts things......
The modus operandi for the sender and recipient was exactly the same as for Nanjo\'s son.
The sender was made out to be Kumasawa\'s son, and the recipient was Kumasawa Chiyo.
And the destination address was in the Okinawa Prefecture.
Okinawa Prefecture, Yaeyama County, Yonaguni City, 1‐2‐341‐5167.
Yonaguni Island is at the westernmost tip of Japan.
And the lot number was exactly like before: a sequential number that had apparently been chosen at random.
......Now it was certain.
 This envelope was definitely sent with the goal of having it be returned to the sender.
Its contents were exactly the same.
A letter with the PIN and the bank\'s central branch written on it.
A swipe card.
 A key with attached number tag.
The inscription on the number tag was A113.
......The number right after the one on the key that had been sent to Nanjo\'s son.
Most likely, inside the vault was the same kind of duralumin case, packed with a hundred million yen in cash......
"......Got the feeling my mom had sent it to me from beyond the grave.
 Don\'t really get what\'s inside, and it\'s creepy, so I just left it alone all this time, and totally forgot about it until today."
"......So, you know what this is, girl?
 Could it be that the same thing came to your place...?"
".......................................ah."
"......What is it, Ange‐sama?"
‘Uryu...headache? Headache...?!’
"............Sorry, my head hurts......
 ......Stabbing pain... .........I know this......"
‘What do you mean, you know this......?’
"You don\'t mean,
 ......this envelope......came to your place too, Ange‐sama...?"
.........I remember......
 ......I remember......!!
A strange envelope was also sent to me...twelve years ago...!!
I had fallen into depression after losing my entire family.
 ...But it was a really strange thing to come in the mail, so a faint memory of it remained.
It was a strange letter, which I had no memory of sending, but which had me as the sender.
I forget the destination address, but the person it had been sent to was Ushiromiya Rudolf.
My father.
I remember that I got this letter I thought was from my father who had died, I opened it up,
 and I found a key and a card that I didn\'t really understand... I remember being really confused.
I felt let down, and threw it away somewhere, I think...
Where did I put that envelope?
I probably lost it somewhere in the chaos that followed.
By now, I have no way of checking its contents.
But somehow I think I can guess.
......I\'m sure the contents were the same.
 Without a doubt, there must have been a key, a card, and a note with a PIN inside the envelope......
"......BEATRICE......
 ......What was she trying to do here...?
 So did she hand out this stupid money to all surviving relatives?
 .........I won\'t forgive her......for mocking them even after their deaths........."
‘Uryu...uryu......Ange.........’
Sakutarou acted nervously.
 ......As I looked at his worrying face, my agitation began to cool off bit by bit...
"I\'m sorry...
 My hatred of BEATRICE isn\'t anything new.
 ......I\'m just surprised and angry to find out that I had a connection with the witch already on that day, at the age of six..."
".........For the past twelve years,
 you have been enslaved by BEATRICE‐sama\'s curse.
 ...This might be proof that this really was a curse.
 But please, don\'t fall apart.
 Part of this journey should be to break through that."
"That\'s right......
 Just letting the blood rise to my head won\'t get me anywhere.
 Got to think calmly.
 .........What\'s going on?
 What\'s the meaning of handing out a hundred million yen to each of the relatives?
 Was she trying to provoke us......?
 Damn that BEATRICE........."
‘Ange......calm down......
 ......Uryu......’
As Sakutaro buried his head in my stomach, he urged me to stay calm.
......I took another deep breath, and started thinking.
".........I wonder if the sending of these envelopes was to demonstrate that this was a premeditated crime by BEATRICE."
"They were postmarked right before the family conference.
 And they were intentionally set up so that they would be sent back after some time."
‘......They wanted them to arrive after the incident, is that it......?’
"Yeah.
 That\'s what it implies.
 .........But it still leaves me wondering a little.
 Why such an uncertain method?"
"Uncertain?"
"Yes.
 After all, you can\'t even guess in advance at how many days it would take for the mail to return.
 ......Normally, you can\'t even guess at the amount of time it will take for the receiving post office to do the research, make a determination of unknown recipient, and send it back."
‘Yeah, now that you mention it......
 It\'d be more certain if they just set an arrival date and mailed it that way......
 Uryu...’
"......Maybe, but still,
 if they mailed it the day before, then no matter how quickly it returned, it would probably have arrived no earlier than Monday.
 I wonder if they wanted to make it seem like a letter from the dead."
"......A letter from the dead, you say."
"......You\'re right.
 That surprises you, and makes you feel horrible.
 ......Some mail with your dead family\'s names written on the outside in large letters...
gets thrown into your mailbox with an ominous label attached."
"......However, it doesn\'t really make sense to me.
 I would have mailed it to arrive on a specified day.
 I just can\'t understand why someone would allow the insecurity of it possibly arriving on a day they weren\'t anticipating."
‘.....................Uryu.
 ......But that really does sound like Beato to me.’
"Huh?
 You...know about Beato?"
‘......Well, I only talked with her a little.
 ......But somehow I can tell that Beato would do something like this.’
‘.........Can\'t you imagine that too, Mammon?
 Beato likes pranks like this, right?’
"..................
 .........Yeah, that might be true.
 ......I wouldn\'t put it past BEATRICE‐sama to try a vicious prank like a letter from the dead."
‘No, not just that part.
 .........BEATRICE would find it more fun to do it in a way that was a little bit uncertain, instead of one that was absolutely certain.’
".........She would find an uncertain method...more fun...?"
I remembered Maria onee‐chan\'s diary...
......It had quite a lot of descriptions of playing with BEATRICE.
Occasionally, some of these involved Beato playing pranks on the adult relatives with Maria.
But those pranks always followed a certain little aesthetic principle of witches.
Which was.........that things are more fun if they are uncertain.
One day, Maria onee‐chan had brought a wind‐up minicar, and she and Beato decided to use it for a prank.
It was a popular toy at the time—if you made the minicar back up, it would wind up the spring in the tires, and when you let go, it would race forwards.
They had wound up that minicar and set it in the shadow of a milk jug.
......In other words, the prank was that, if you lifted the milk jug, the minicar would jump forwards and surprise whoever did it.
Hoping that someone would get caught in this prank, Onee‐chan and Beato had watched the adults from the shadows for their whole teatime.
They were looking forward to seeing who would get caught by it, but ultimately, no one moved the trap milk jug, and the trap never went off......
When Onee‐chan had then muttered "We should have put it somewhere where they\'d definitely get caught by it",
 Beato apparently said this.
She said,
 "Traps where you don\'t know who will get caught, or even whether anyone will get caught at all, are more thrilling and fun".
......It\'s probably true that you wouldn\'t get that kind of excitement from a trap that would definitely catch someone.
......This kind of description occurred in multiple places,
 making it possible to guess that the witch called BEATRICE had quite a fickle character and loved a random thrill......
A fickle person is very hard to deal with.
 I can\'t flip over the chessboard......to find out what that witch from twelve years ago was planning.
As Ange thought these things over, her gaze wandered from place to place.
Then, she suddenly showed interest in the wall.
There, a number of framed photographs were hung.
Many were commemorative photos from when the Kumasawas got together as a family or went somewhere to play, and Kumasawa herself was in many of them.
...Still with a smile that made it so you could almost hear her lighthearted hoh‐hoh‐ho laugh.
......It\'s a distant memory, but I do remember that she was definitely this sort of cheerful old lady...
"Did you notice anything different about Kumasawa‐san in the days leading up to the incident...?"
"Nope.
 She looked the same as ever.
 .....Grumbling about how tough the family conference was and how it put her on edge, same as always."
"............?
 ......What\'s this?"
Among the numerous frames, there was one that had something other than a picture of people in it.
It was a photograph of an enlarged relief of a door from a Western‐style house or something.
......I couldn\'t see any interesting subject in particular, which actually bugged me a bit as I wondered why anyone had gone to all the trouble of taking it.
As I got closer, I realized that some text had been written in pen.
"......Oh yeah, that\'s a photo I got when Mom\'s belongings were distributed.
 I think it probably has something to do with that "Legend of the Gold" thing."
"The witch\'s epitaph, you mean?
 Rumored to point to the location of the hidden ten tons of gold...
 ......So Kumasawa‐san tried to solve it too, I see.
 But this isn\'t the epitaph.
 ......It\'s the first time I\'ve seen it."
There was an arch above the Western‐style door, and that arch had a relief.
 It was an inscription in English, and that seemed to be the focus of the photograph.
The pen writing appeared to be a translation into Japanese.
".....................
 "This door will only open with a probability of 1/1,000,000,000,000,000.
 You will only be blessed with a probability of 1/1,000,000,000,000,000."
 .........I don\'t know it.
 Nothing like this ever showed up in the epitaph or Onee‐chan\'s diary."
"In Mom\'s belongings, there were quite a few photos and notebooks that looked like they were from her trying to solve the epitaph\'s riddle."
"Turns out she was actually surprisingly fond of that kind of thing.
 And there was that rumor that ten tons of gold bars were hidden somewhere.
 No wonder she was so besotted by it."
In both Maria onee‐chan\'s diary and in her grimoire, there was a description of the witch\'s epitaph.
It mentioned about how it was a ritual to open the door to the Golden Land, and BEATRICE\'s resurrection ritual, and BEATRICE\'s succession ceremony.
 And so on.
Maybe the most interesting one was the last line, the succession ceremony.
According to BEATRICE,
 if you were able to solve the witch\'s epitaph,
 you would receive not only the ten tons of gold and the Ushiromiya family inheritance,
 but her own magical power and name, as well as the title of Golden Witch.
Among the Ushiromiya family at the time, the witch\'s epitaph was thought of as a difficult quiz, which the head, Kinzo, had prepared to select his successor.
But in the Mariage Sorcière interpretation, the questioner was BEATRICE herself,
 and she had posed the question in part to choose her successor.
......There were slight discrepancies in the details of the two interpretations.
Either way, its disturbing contents brought to mind a bloody serial murder,
 and both of the message bottles depicted a crime that followed that pattern.
If I could solve the witch\'s epitaph now, twelve years later, I wonder if I could expose some plot made back then......
I tried to solve it many times myself, but I never did have a clue what it meant.
It seems that many Witch Hunters have been trying as well.
I also found theories like the La Plata theory and the Enoura theory in certain books.
However, none of these theories were conclusive......
"Are there any other materials?"
"I think so, but they were all split up between my siblings.
 I don\'t have a clue who has what.
 Sorry."
".........Just reading this English text that Kumasawa‐san took a picture of, it gives the impression that this was a forbidden door that was rarely opened."
"......But where in the mansion is it, I wonder.
 Judging by the lighting, it looks like it\'s outside.
 ......I wonder if Kumasawa‐san suspected that the gold was hidden in there."
"Who knows.
 In any case, it\'s probably somewhere in the Rokkenjima mansion.
 ......It\'s a pity, but there wasn\'t the kind of money in Mom\'s bank account to make me think she found the gold.
 Uhahahaha, she probably didn\'t find it after all."
......The Golden Witch, BEATRICE, gave ten tons of gold to Kinzo.
Which meant that the witch was the true owner of the gold.
BEATRICE was the owner of all the vast fortune of the Ushiromiya family.
The witch holding this vast wealth had massacred the humans on Rokkenjima on that day,
 ...and sent large amounts of money to the surviving relatives like it was a game.
......Like hell it\'s a letter from the dead.
 This is desecration of the dead.
I was once again convinced.
 ......My family, who died on the island that day, didn\'t die and go to heaven.
They\'re being trapped by the witch even now, and are being desecrated and tormented for all eternity......
The last place Ange visited...
was a store in a region where residential and commercial areas intermingled, with a signboard saying "Marufuku Sleep Shop"......
There lived the man who had been the captain of the ferryboat to Rokkenjima at the time.
......Even he, who had once lived as a man of the sea, had retired after contracting a serious illness,
 and was now being taken care of at the house of his son and his son\'s wife...
"I remember you well...!
 You were only about yea high.
 Look at you now...!
 You must have been absolutely devastated.
 I understand how you feel, believe me...!"
The former boat captain was so full of energy that you couldn\'t really tell why he had retired in the first place.
His memory seemed clear too; he had a good memory of things that had happened more than a decade prior, and it seemed that he could even remember how Ange had been at the time.
The lively conversation was very helpful for Ange,
 ......but at the same time, the captain also remembered the final family conference very well,
 and the fact that he had detailed memories of even Battler\'s "gonna fall gonna fall uproar" on the boat was instead painful for Ange.
It had been so back then as well, but even now, there was no public way to cross to Rokkenjima.
It was necessary to make an individual request to an owner of a boat to make the voyage.
I still hadn\'t managed to arrange for a boat to Rokkenjima,
 so if he refused me, the voyage to Rokkenjima would probably become hopeless......
"No need to explain.
 It\'d be no easy job finding a boat willing to go to that island at this point.
 ......Nowadays, some of \'em don\'t even call it Rokkenjima any more, they call it by its old name, Akujikijima.
 Can\'t see you getting any sailor round here to help you out."
Originally, Rokkenjima had been feared as an island of disaster by the fishermen.
And when that incident happened twelve years ago, that fear reached its peak......
They respected the sea, feared it, and revered it.
 There were almost no sailors who would try to take a boat to the cursed island.
Because of that, most of the Witch Hunters were unable to cross over to Rokkenjima,
 and were limited to taking a trip around the island.
......Ironically, this caused the mystique surrounding Rokkenjima to increase even more,
 and resulted in the proliferation of the bizarre witch stories they loved so much...
".........Would you take me in your boat?"
"Mm.
 They\'re sposed to give her back to me just for tomorrow.
 I hear the engine\'s been acting up lately, though.
 We\'ll crank it up to full throttle!"
The former boat captain promised that tomorrow, he would go back to his previous job and take his boat out to Rokkenjima.
With this, I\'d managed to secure a method of transport to Rokkenjima.
This is probably all I can do on Niijima.
All that\'s left is...tomorrow.
 On Rokkenjima, ......I\'ll reach the final destination of a journey that stretches back twelve years.
‘That\'s great news...
 You\'ll be able to go to the island now...’
"Yes.
 ......I\'d heard that it would be hard to find a boat, so the boat captain\'s cooperation really helped me out."
".........Although he may not have been as badly affected as you, Ange‐sama,
 I\'m sure that the incident twelve years ago has been a thorn for the boat captain as well, one that he still hasn\'t been able to pull out."
‘......Uryu.
 ......Even the captain wasn\'t able to find closure.
 This whole time.’
"Well, yeah.
 ......If that guy had taken his boat out on October 5th as promised, there\'s a chance that he could\'ve saved a great many people.
 If he hadn\'t been hesitant with his boat just because of a little wind..."
‘Uryu... You shouldn\'t say things like that...
 I\'m sure that\'s pained the captain constantly until today......’
I heard that it had truly been right in the middle of a typhoon on October 5th.
According to the boat captain, he had known for certain that they would be trapped by the typhoon if they headed to Rokkenjima on October 4th.
But the family had been very insistent upon that date, which had been determined beforehand as the date of the conference.
......It was only natural.
 All of the adults had their own packed schedules, and had come to the family conference having arranged those schedules in advance.
They probably had their own circumstances preventing them from easily pushing it back to next week just because the typhoon was approaching.
......It wasn\'t the boat captain\'s fault.
But perhaps you could say that he didn\'t feel so guiltless that he could place the blame wholly on the typhoon.
Certainly, just as these two said, there\'s no doubt that the boat captain has been dragging the events of twelve years ago along with him this whole time.
......And, by taking me, the last member of the Ushiromiya line, to the island,
 and bringing me back safely, he might be trying to find some resolution for the past...
"The boat\'s meant to be coming back just after noon.
 I\'ll take you to Rokkenjima after that, so we should get there before evening.
 It\'s an island without electricity or lights.
 You won\'t be able to stay long.
 ......Is a short trip like that gonna satisfy you?"
".....................
 It\'s not the kind of thing where staying longer will satisfy me more.
 I\'m grateful just to have you take me there."
"Mm, don\'t mention it.
 If I hadn\'t parted with my boat, I wouldn\'t have to be so stingy, and I\'d be able to take you to the island as much as you like..."
It\'s not like I have a goal of doing something in particular on Rokkenjima.
So, the time of day I\'ll be staying there is evening...
......The evening, which straddles the two different worlds of day and night, seemed almost like a borderline between this world and the next—
or possibly, between 1998 and 1986—and felt like the most fitting time to visit Rokkenjima.
......It\'s not like I\'ll be doing anything on the island.
 Staying there for just a few hours will be just fine if I can feel some closure.
At that time, there was a small knock on the paper sliding door, and Amakusa stuck his head in, tapping his watch.
I nodded back and told him I\'d gotten hold of a boat for tomorrow.
"That\'s great.
 ......It\'s about time for us to go.
 We\'ll be counting on you tomorrow, Captain."
"You betcha!
 I know all about the troubles you\'ve had.
 I was watching the talk shows at the time, and I was disgusted by all the people stirring up that incident just for fun.
 I\'ll help you out any way I can."
"Thank you very much.
 ......Then we\'ll see you noon tomorrow.
 Umm, here.
 The fare for the boat."
Ange took a wrapped wad of ten‐thousand yen bills from her pocket.
The boat captain must have seen its thickness as well.
 But he paid it absolutely no interest, and shook his head.
"......I\'m grateful to you.
 This is guidance from heaven.
 I\'m being given a final chance to take you to Rokkenjima and bring you back safely."
"Now, I\'ll finally be able to finish the final job Kinzo‐san entrusted me with.
 So I\'m grateful to you.
 I got more than enough money from Kinzo‐san back then.
 Can\'t take it from you."
".....................Thank you very much."
"Watch your step on the stairs.
 They\'re a doozy."
......I went down the steep staircase that was the exact opposite of "accessible".
It was getting hard to believe that there had actually been a chest of drawers and a TV in the room upstairs.
Most of the first floor was a bedding store, with many futons piled up on each other.
The captain followed behind us as we weaved our way through the cramped futon shop.
After cautiously checking around outside, Amakusa dashed out first and started up the car.
"My grandkid\'s room is empty.
 I really wouldn\'t mind if you stayed there.
 As you can tell, I\'m up to my eyes in futons."
"Thanks a lot for the offer.
 ......But I can\'t cause you trouble if worst comes to worst."
".........Dunno your circumstances, but seems to me like you\'re caught up in a lot of trouble.
 There\'s rumors some shady people are on the lookout for someone.
 Wouldn\'t happen to be you, would it?"
".....................
 ......How should I know?"
Ange played dumb, but it looked as though the boat captain had guessed.
"My job was to take visitors to Rokkenjima over to the island, ......and bring them back again."
"......That job was interrupted twelve years ago, and it still hasn\'t been finished.
 So, thanks to you, I\'m finally gonna be able to finish that job."
"....................."
"So what I\'m saying is.
 .........Please let me finish the job.
 Do you understand?"
"..................
 ......Yes.
 It\'s not like I\'m going there to die."
But part of me does feel that, if I could die on that island, I would surely be able to go to where my family is......
I had finally become aware of it.
 ......I might have been planning......to die on that island.
I might have come all this way, heading for Rokkenjima, in search of a place to die.
The boat captain had guessed that as well.
And so, for emphasis, he told me again: Don\'t.
".........I won\'t.
 I promise.
 .........In the first place,
 I\'m still unclear about why I even have to go to Rokkenjima, what the purpose is at all."
"No, I\'m sure there\'s gotta be one.
 If there isn\'t one for you, ...then there is one for them.
 The island called you.
 That\'s why you came here."
".........You might...be right.
 ...I might......have been called."
I was called.
 For what reason?
 For them.
Mom.
 Dad.
 Battler onii‐chan.
......And...Maria onee‐chan.
.........Or maybe, the Golden Witch.
 BEATRICE.
What does Rokkenjima have for me?
And what will I achieve?
Even though tomorrow was almost upon me at last, I still wasn\'t able to understand my own mission......
There was the sound of a car stopping in front of the store, and a short honk could be heard.
"Then I\'ll see you tomorrow.
 Have a nice evening."
"Mm."
I got past the stacks of futons in the narrow store, and was about to go outside.
............Just then, my feet stopped.
"......What is it?"
"...........................Uh,
 ...............umm,
 what is that......?"
"Hmm?
 That?
 What?
 What are you talking about?"
Trembling all over, .........I pointed at it.
But no matter how much the boat captain squinted, he noticed absolutely nothing in that direction that should have surprised me.
......That means,
 ............th‐......that means............
"............Im‐impossible......
 ...Wh‐why............?"
‘U‐.........uryu.........
 ......Ange,
 ......why?
 What\'s going on......?!’
"......I, .........I don\'t have a clue either......
 There\'s no way something that ridiculous......
 Is this magic?
 A miracle......?"
".........Yes, this is probably fate.
 ......I just......understood.
 ............This......was my mission."
‘............Uryu...............’
"I.........don\'t have a clue what\'s........."
I was frozen in position, shaking, pointing into the semi‐darkness inside the store......
"Wh‐what is it?
 What\'s over there?!
 I don\'t, ...I don\'t understand...
 Wh‐what is it that you see...?!"
"Thank you, Captain.
 ......All of this, all of it,
 ......it was all fate.
 Even me visiting this place...
...was fate.
 ............This...
......is the mission...and the purpose...that I\'m going to Rokkenjima for........."
"............Ange‐san?
 What is it, is something wrong?"
"I, I\'m as clueless as you...!
 She\'s just gone still as a statue, pointing into the darkness...!"
"Ange‐san......?
 Are you alright?
 What can you see......?"
"Can\'t you two see it?
 That, right there.
 ......Can\'t you see it?!"
"All I can see is a normal display case.
 There\'s no one there, missy...?"
‘Uryu............Ange......
 ......I don\'t know what\'s going on......
 ......Is this......a dream?
 Magic......?
 What\'s happening......?
 ...............?
 ............Ange...............?’
Sakutarou lifted his face towards Ange......
From her eyes...
...
...slid a single tear.
".........Ange‐sama.................."
"......I understand.
 Onee‐chan.
 ......And...
............BEATRICE."
‘.........Uryu.........’
So this............is magic.........
