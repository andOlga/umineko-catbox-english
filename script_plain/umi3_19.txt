"Hahahaha, wahahahaha!
 I never thought that Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}\'s piece would barge in at the very end...!"
"......I searched all over the place for a piece fitting for a game with you.
 ......I\'m sure that you\'ll grow to enjoy her."
"What\'s with that piece?!
 Who was that person, who was it?!
 She didn\'t say her name! That\'s not fair!!
 Hey, don\'t you think so too?!"
"...I have a general idea.
 ......Come on, normally, anyone would know."
"Normally?!
 No we wouldn\'t, it was that character\'s first appearance, wasn\'t it?!
 If she doesn\'t say her name, I won\'t—the players won\'t—everyone won\'t know, right?!"
"............Beato, it\'s alright if you don\'t tell her.
 See?
 Isn\'t she a funny kid?"
"M‐...mm.
 ......Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}\'s simple‐minded naiveté truly is precious and funny.
 ......*cackle*cackle*!"
"Why, why, why I am the only one you won\'t tell, you meanie!!
 Okay, in exchange, I\'ll teach you a special secret that only I know!
 So tell me!"
"......Hoh.
 A special secret, you say!
 Now that, I do want to hear...!"
"Blehhh!
 If you want me to tell you, first tell me who that woman really was!
 The secret I know sure is awesome!
 I mean, it\'s gonna blow you away like finding out that Santa‐san is actually Daddy!"
"Huh?
 *giggle*!
 Oopsie☆ Sorry, I\'ll bet you\'re so shocked that your world turned upside‐down, right?!
 Oh‐hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho!"
".........Your father was the one who came to your place, Lambda?"
"To my place... Wait, what\'s that supposed to mean?"
"...Lord {f:5:Santa Claus} only visits the homes of children with clean hearts.
 He didn\'t come to your place, then?"
"Well, Lord {f:5:Santa Claus} is gracious.
 Unless you are a reeeally bad scoundrel, he will give you a present.
 After all, he even gave them to me!"
".........As you grow and your heart becomes hardened, he stops coming, doesn\'t he?
 How old were you, Beato, when he stopped coming?"
"Mm.
 He stopped coming when I was about twelve.
 My maiden\'s heart awoke, and I quickly got somewhat embarrassed about Lord {f:5:Santa} coming."
"After I wrote "Thanks for everything, that\'s enough.
 So make sure you splurge on the last presents", he stopped coming.
 Oooh, and I was looking forward to it too!
 How old were you when he stopped coming, Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}?"
".........I was pretty wild.
 ...It happened fairly early.
 I think when I was about nine.
 ...Something about that beard really irritated me, so I waited in my futon with some sewing scissors ready, thinking I\'d cut it off.
 ............What a cringeworthy age."
"So, ......Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}, as long as you can remember, Lord {f:5:Santa Claus} has never come to see you, you say.
 ............He usually comes until the last year of elementary school or during middle school."
"...Maybe we should have a doctor look at her.
 I hear that maturing too fast can have an adverse effect on the growth of mind and body.
 ...Yeah, there\'s definitely some of those.
 ...Adverse effects."
"Hey, wh‐what are you guys talking about!!
 Gaaaaah!!"
"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!
 Wahahahaha, it truly is boisterous when three witches gather!"
"......If you\'re talking about that level of secret, I doubt it\'s worth listening to.
 Can I go now?
 I have to prepare for the next game."
"Wha—hey, wait a sec!
 Tell me who that woman really was!!"
"......Well then, tell me this special secret of yours first.
 If it\'s good enough, then I\'ll tell you."
"Hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho!!
 Alright, I\'ll tell you, and it really is a special secret, okay?!
 ......Remember, in this game, there was a girl who found the gold and became the new witch, right?"
"Mm.
 Just what kind of secret could that person have?"
"Ehheheheheh!
 I realized who that girl actually is.
 Does anyone know?
 *giggle*giggle*!
 There was a hint in the way she talked."
"Remember, that girl said it a lot, right?
 "Why don\'t you something foreverrrr?",
 right?!
 Yes, that phrase was the main point!
 Foreverrrr?
 For Evaaaa?
 Yes!"
"She was actually...Ushiromiya Eva!!
 What do you think?!
 Are you shocked?!
 Oh‐hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho!!"
"Hoh...!
 I did not notice that!
 ...Mngh, to think that there would be a hint in a place like that."
"......You\'re good at playing along with her, Beato.
 This kid can get a little full of herself, so don\'t take it too far.
 See you, I\'m leaving."
"Wait, wait!
 It\'s not fair if you just listen to my secret and don\'t tell me yours!!
 Tell me who she really was!!"
"......Your secret was so incredible that mine just wouldn\'t match up.
 ...So in exchange, I\'ll tell you my own special secret.
 I\'ll tell you the name of the culprit in this game called Higurashi no Naku Koro ni."
"Gyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, don\'t tell meee!!
 I\'m playing it right nowwww!!"
"......Ahhahahahahhahhahhahhah...
 See you, Beato.
 The black tea was delicious.
 Oh, about the crackers, though, the repertoire of jam was lacking.
 Get some gochujang chili paste every once in a while.
 It goes great with Russian tea.
 Later."
"I see. Alright.
 I shall try it.
 I shall call for you when the preparations are finished for the next game.
 Until then, feel free to draw up a strategy at your leisure."
"Yes, I will.
 This last game was pretty interesting.
 Later."
"Heyyy, wait a sec, tell meee!!!"
"*cackle*cackle*.
 My, my, you two really are close."
"..............................
 ......Yes, that\'s right.
 ...Oh, how I love you, {f:5:Bernkastel}.
 You could even say I\'m in love with you."
"......I want to gouge out her eyes so she can see no one other than me.
 ......Oh, wouldn\'t that just be to die for?
 It\'d be wonderful to dunk them in black tea.
 Ahah!"
"Who knew she had entranced Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta} to this extent.
 ......It seems I carry a heavy responsibility.
 Still, this last game truly was close!
 I was a breath away from defeating Battler."
"..................Beato.
 Can I ask you something?"
"What is it?
 I won\'t tell you that girl\'s name.
 *cackle*cackle*!"
"...Just when are you going to stop screwing around?
 ...Do you even have the slightest intention of winning?"
{f:5:Lambdadelta} threatened her with a low voice that she had never used in front of {f:5:Bernkastel}.
...It completely blew away the calm atmosphere which had been there until a moment ago.
".........You know,
 I\'m supporting you \'cause you\'re meant to be a witch who can win against {f:5:Bernkastel}.
 If you don\'t have the power to win against her,
 then I\'m ready to abandon you at any time, got it......?"
"...............How scathing.
 What about me dissatisfies you?
 ...As you know, my game board is perfect.
 Lady {f:5:Bernkastel} will never be able to win..."
"Yeah, that\'s right.
 Your board truly is impressive.
 {f:5:Bernkastel} could spend a hundred years,
 or even a thousand years here, and she would still be unable to win against this game board, it truly is that impressive and perfect."
"......That\'s why, in exchange for letting me borrow that, I made you a witch.
 .........If I stop being your guardian, you\'ll immediately go back to being a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}.
 ...Make sure you don\'t forget that, no matter how much incredible magical power you hold, ......you are nothing more than a temporary witch."
"I, ......I know that.
 ...I am grateful to you..."
"Don\'t speak so casually.
 I\'ll forgive that when {f:5:Bernkastel}\'s around, but I won\'t when she isn\'t.
 Recently, maybe you\'ve forgotten your debt to me."
"Th‐that is, .........n‐...not, ......not so, my Lady......"
"...Aah, changed my mind, that creeps me out.
 You can talk the same way as usual.
 But be mindful of what you say.
 ......I have a surprisingly short temper, you see?"
"M‐......mm......"
"Back to the point.
 ...Your game board truly is perfect.
 ......You should be able to defeat {f:5:Bernkastel} without any trouble.
 ...But that kid won\'t give in easily.
 She\'ll challenge you over and over."
"That is no problem.
 ...It has been certified by you, Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}.
 ......My game board is perfect."
"Yeah, that\'s right, it\'s perfect.
 ............So long as you, the player, are perfect as well, that is?"
".........I don\'t understand what you mean by this..."
"What I mean by this...?
 That\'s what I want to ask you.
 .........You play around a lot in your games.
 ...At first, I thought it was part of your tactics, because it would completely baffle {f:5:Bernkastel} from time to time."
"............But I get the feeling that\'s not quite true.
 You\'re not playing around in a match you know you can win,
 ......the truth is, you don\'t care whether you win or lose, do you?"
"R‐......ridiculous...
 How could that be..."
"Listen close, okay?
 Your role is to break {f:5:Bernkastel}, force her to yield.
 In other words, that means being the victor in this game for all eternity.
 ......As long as you keep trying to become the certain victor, then I will give you my power as the Witch of Certainty.
 ............However."
"If you fight in a way that doesn\'t deny any possibility of your loss,
 ...that\'s a different story."
"This is a game, of course...
 In the same way that Lady {f:5:Bernkastel} will lose if I win,
 ...there will be some days on which I will lose and she will win.
 The possibility of loss always exists.
 That is why I—"
"...............This is why you\'re useless.
 There\'s no need for this to be a game board for you.
 It simply needs to be a bird cage to lock {f:5:Bernkastel} up here for all eternity."
"...What\'s the role of a bird cage?
 Making certain that the little bird inside never escapes.
 ......What\'s a bird cage worth if it has gaps that sometimes let the bird out?"
".........O‐of course, games exist to be won.
 So it is impossible for me to lose.
 ...Therefore, I will continue to win......
 ...As you wish, for all eternity..."
"Good answer—that\'s all I want.
 ......I\'ll allow you to play around and use fakes as part of your tactics.
 ...It was sometimes effective in this last game."
"............But hear this.
 If you make a move hoping for anything else other than victory,
 ............make sure you\'re wonderfully prepared, okay?"
"I, I will not do such a thing...
 I swear it...!"
"............Originally, you weren\'t even a witch,
 and I can remind you what a truly shabby creature you were at any time.
 ............If you betray my expectations...
 At that time, I will have a delightful delightful penalty waiting for you."
"...Of the billions of fragment worlds out there, ......I\'ll send you into the most miserable fragment and seal you there.
 .........You were miserable in the first place, so it\'ll be worth choosing a really miserable fragment.
 ...*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*."
"................................."
"Oh, how I love you, {f:5:Bernkastel}.
 ...Scrabble your feet in {f:5:Beatrice}\'s bird cage as much as you like,
 and spend a thousand years learning that you can no longer escape."
"......And when you give in,
 ...I\'ll train you so that you can\'t tweet in anyone\'s palm but mine."
"............*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*,
 ahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha...!!"
