"............You\'ve...
been indulging in alcohol again, haven\'t you?"
The old physician let out a sigh as he removed the stethoscope.
Two elderly men could be seen in the dimly lit study, which was filled with dust and a sickly sweet stench.
In the corner of this room, which was much larger than what most people would call a study,
 there was an expensive‐looking bed, a man undergoing a medical examination, and the physician conducting it.
There was also what appeared to be a servant watching over the whole scene.
"The bottle is my friend.
 It is no less of a friend than you, and it has stood by my side even longer than you have."
The man who had bared his chest for the stethoscope spoke unapologetically as he straightened out his clothes.
"............Kinzo‐san.
 ...Your body only appears to be well thanks to the effects of the medicine.
 However, if you continue to drink such strong spirits, the treatment will become meaningless.
 ...Trust my judgment.
 Temper your drinking."
"I thank you, though only for the sentiment,
 my friend.
 .........Genji.
 Another glass.
 Water it down slightly.
 That way Nanjo can save face."
".........Are you quite sure?"
After eyeing both the master who demanded the alcohol and his doctor who forbade it,
 Genji, the old butler, silently gave a slight nod and carried out his master\'s orders faithfully.
Nanjo, the man\'s personal doctor, let out a deep sigh once again as he watched the butler busy himself alongside the liquor cabinet...
There was a smell filling up the room.
...This sweet, poisonous aroma felt as though it melted the heart, if not the soul itself.
 It was the smell of that venomous green drink that the man couldn\'t bring himself to part from.
"......Nanjo.
 You are my close friend of many years.
 I am deeply grateful for all that you have done to keep me alive this long."
"I have done nothing.
 ......After all, you never listen to my advice as your physician."
"Hahahaha...
 And you never listen when I warn you about a mistaken chess move you\'re about to make.
 It seems we are even."
"......My lord."
"Thank you.
 ......I wouldn\'t die if I ran out of your medicine, but I would if I ran out of this."
With one eye on Nanjo, who had his face set in a resigned expression, Kinzo took the glass that Genji was holding out to him.
...There are probably very few people who would associate the venomous color which filled the glass with an alcoholic beverage.
".........Nanjo.
 Be honest with me.
 How much time do I have left?"
"Well now...
 How short must I make it to get you to stop drinking?"
Nanjo once again let out a sigh of resignation.
As he watched Kinzo down the glass regardless, he spoke.
".........You don\'t have much time."
"...What precisely do you mean by that?"
"......Let us illustrate it with the chess game here.
 You are closing out the game quite well, but I do not ultimately see you cornering my king."
Nanjo\'s gaze was directed at a side table with a stately chess set placed on top of it.
Judging by the positioning of the pieces, the match was well into the endgame.
The black rook and bishop were cutting deeply into the enemy lines.
The white king had already been castled and cornered, so that even an amateur could see that the match would reach its conclusion before too long.
Every time Nanjo came to give a medical examination, both of them would make a few moves.
Nanjo was stating with confidence that Kinzo would most likely fall into his eternal sleep before this game could be concluded.
...These were less the words of a physician than they were the words of an old friend.
"............Were you a normal patient,
 I would recommend that you write a will at this point."
"......And what is a will, Nanjo?
 Handwritten instructions to the vultures on how to devour and scatter my corpse?"
"No, not at all.
 ......As the word suggests, it is a way for you to record your will for later generations.
 It is far more than just a means to divide up your inheritance."
"Hoh.
 ......And apart from the division of the inheritance, what might I write of?"
"............Oh, there\'s your regrets...
and matters you have left unfinished.
 Things you want to be passed down...
...and things you want to tell.
 ......Anything you want."
"......Hmph.
 .........Things I want to be passed down and things I want to tell?
 Ridiculous.
 I, Ushiromiya Kinzo, have not one thing I want to tell or leave behind!!"
"I was born with nothing.
 I will die with nothing!
 There is nothing I wish to leave to my foolish children!!
 Even if the end were to come today—even if it were to come right now!
 I shall accept this fate of death without a trace of fear!!"
"......Kinzo‐san."
"I created everything.
 My fortune!
 My prestige!
 Everything!!
 Those were built up by me, and they will be lost along with me.
 There is nothing I wish to leave behind!!"
"Nothing!!
 After I\'m gone, I care not if it all goes to waste!
 I desire no tomb, no coffin!!
 Those were the terms of the contract I made with the witch!
 When I die, everything will be lost!
 That has been part of the promise since the beginning, and that\'s why nothing will be left behind.
 There is nothing I can leave behind!!"
After reaching a furious crescendo, Kinzo suddenly slumped over.
...His expression was limp and feeble, as though an evil spirit had possessed him and then left.
"..................
 However, I do have one regret.
 I have nothing to leave behind, but there is one thing I cannot leave undone..."
".........You would do well to write it down.
 Of course, it would be best if you could finish it before your time comes.
 However, even if the worst happens, those who come after you will carry it to completion.
 You must leave behind your regrets so that they can be resolved even if you are unable to do so yourself.
 ......That is the purpose of a will."
When Nanjo tried to gently pat Kinzo\'s shoulder, the dying man flew into a sudden rage and batted away Nanjo\'s hand.
"That is no good, no good, no good!!"
"It must be done while I still live! At the moment of my death, my soul will be devoured by the demons of the contract and wiped out of existence!
 For me, there will be no peace or another world after death!
 That\'s why everything must be done before I go!!
 That\'s why a will has no meaning for me!!"
"And if I had the time to write such a thing...
 ...If I had such time to spare!!
 ...I\'d want to see it.
 I\'d want to see it one more time!
 I want to see {f:5:Beatrice}\'s smiling face one last time!!"
"Oh, {f:5:Beatrice}, why do you resist me so?!
 I would return everything you have given me right this very moment—I am prepared to lose everything!!
 So please, show me your smile just one more time..."
"{f:5:Beatrice}, I beg of you—you must be able to hear this final plea—that\'s the kind of woman you are!
 I beg of you, show yourself to me!!
 You\'re here, aren\'t you?!
 You\'re standing there invisible, listening to every word I say, and even now you\'re mocking me from somewhere in this room, aren\'t you?!"
"Please, appear before me one more time and smile!!
 Feel free to scold me, even snatch away my life by your own hands if you wish!!
 I don\'t want to die alone like this!!
 I cannot let myself die until I\'ve seen your smile just one more time!!"
"Aah, {f:5:Beatrice}, {f:5:Beatrice}!!
 I offer up this life of mine, I offer it up to you!!
 I\'m begging you, {f:5:Beatriceeeeee}!!!"
"Whoa...
 Things sure move with the times...
 I can\'t believe we\'ll be able to make the trip in just twenty minutes..."
I couldn\'t help but scratch my head and marvel at how far things have come in recent years.
We used to go by boat.
Back then, we were all forced to endure nearly half a day of swaying back and forth over the sea before we reached Niijima.
 Things have gotten so much more convenient these days.
Still, I\'ve never been on a plane this small.
I\'ve flown in a huge jumbo jet before, but this will be my first experience in such a tiny one.
...It\'s going to shake, isn\'t it...
 They say that smaller boats shake more, so I guess the same rule probably applies to planes.
...Aaah, just spare me.
"Haahahaha, don\'t worry, Battler‐kun.
 It\'ll shake much less than that boat did."
"Gyah?! ...I‐is that you, George‐aniki?!"
"Heheh, don\'t scare me like that... You just shaved three years off my life.
 Anyway, what\'s shaking got to do with anything?"
"Ihihihi, you don\'t think I\'m actually scared of the plane shaking or maybe falling out of the sky or something, ri~ght?"
"Oh, of course not, my mistake.
 I\'m sure that you\'ve changed a lot since we last saw you.
 After all, it\'s been six years since then.
 You\'re not a kid anymore.
 Hahahahaha."
"Sheesh, and here you are, old enough to smoke and drink.
 I\'ve got no interest in smoking, but I\'ve always wanted to try some booze, heheheh!
 Well, if you\'ve got your dad\'s genes, I\'ll bet you can hold your own when it comes to drinking, right?"
"Well, I usually drink for business rather than pleasure.
 It\'s pretty hard to do business in Japan without it."
"Ihihihi!
 That\'s exactly right!
 So I was thinking I\'d take my first shot at it tonight at dinner!"
"Th‐that\'s no good, Battler‐kun, you\'re still a minor!
 Drinking alcohol is known to stunt the growth of minors and...
...um, never mind."
"Come on, I\'m tall enough already!
 In fact, it\'d be easier to find clothes if I shrunk a little!"
I puffed my chest out proudly.
Until I hit my growth spurt, my height was below average in my class.
But then, I grew and grew, and before I knew it, I was over 180 cm.
I guess I have all that muscle training and those shady mail‐order performance‐enhancing drugs to thank for that.
Before then, I\'d never dreamed that I\'d shoot ten centimeters above George‐aniki, who\'d reached his peak height early on.
......Damn, I\'ll bet my relatives all say "look how big you\'ve grown, Battler‐chan!" or something.
...That kind of thing is really embarrassing, so I hope they cut me a break.
Anyway, my name, "Battler"...
...well, it\'s pretty damn weird, don\'t you think?
I\'ve got to wonder what my parents were thinking when they gave me that name.
I\'ve never met anyone who could read it right the first time.
I usually get called "Sento‐kun".
Too bad, swing and a miss.
My name is written 右代宮 戦人.
Can you read it?
 The first part is my family name, "Ushiromiya".
 That\'s a fairly plausible Japanese pronunciation so far.
The problem is my own name.
.........戦人 is made up of the characters for "fight" and "person", and it\'s pronounced "Battler".
Put it all together, and you\'ve got Ushiromiya Battler.
Pretty crazy, right?
 It\'s crazy enough that my parents decided to call me that, but it\'s even more crazy that some government worker let them make it official.
 ...Both groups are at the top of my must‐kill list.
Anyway, this is one of my cousins.
His name is 右代宮 譲治, pronounced Ushiromiya George.
He\'s five years older than me, so he\'s probably turning 23 this year.
Since the Ushiromiya cousins consist of two boys and three girls, I ended up playing with George all the time.
And because I\'ve always thought of him as a big brother, I still call him "Aniki" today.
"Whoo, Battler‐kun, look how big you\'ve gotten.
 You know what they say, "leave a boy for three days and you\'ll hardly recognize him"!"
"It must be in his blood, I suppose.
 Rudolf wasn\'t that tall either until around his high school years.
 Perhaps people end up taller if their growth spurt comes late."
"Nah, it\'s nothing special.
 A real man needs to be tough on the inside too!"
"Exactly!
 Battler‐kun here knows how it works!
 Real men win or lose based on what they\'ve got on the inside!
 Can\'t ever forget to keep up your trainin\' and discipline.
 You do that, wait verrry alertly for the perfect moment...and strike!"
"Now, even I never imagined that I\'d become the company president I am today, master of my own domain...
 Yep, to think I\'ve come this far after starting out penniless and ruined...!"
This portly and slightly chubby man...
is George‐aniki\'s dad, Uncle Hideyoshi (秀吉).
He\'s the husband of Dad\'s older sister.
In other words, we\'re not blood‐related.
He\'s nice to children, sociable all the time, even quick to give out some spending money to us kids—simply put, he\'s an awesome uncle.
He speaks in an odd and very noticeable Kansai‐style dialect seemingly of his own creation, but he\'s actually a natural‐born Kanto man.
Apparently, leaving an impression is everything in the business world,
 so speaking in a different style than other people is an act that makes him stick out more.
......However, I hear that he gets embarrassed when talking within earshot of a real Kansai person, so he switches back to standard Japanese.
...I don\'t really get it, but he\'s definitely an interesting person.
"If only you weren\'t so quick to brag about your life\'s story.
 That\'s enough for now, I think.
 I\'m sure Battler‐kun\'s getting tired of it.
 Aren\'t you?"
"Nope, not at all, hihihi!
 Nothing wrong with that.
 I think it\'s pretty cool for a man to have some stories he can brag about.
 I don\'t have anything like that at all."
"Oh, really?
 I\'d imagine a man with your looks would leave girls crying left and right, so I have trouble believing that you have nothing at all to brag about..."
"Nonononono!
 Y‐y‐
you\'re joking, right?!
 Of course nothing weird like that\'s ever happened to me!
 In fact, if you know anyone, I\'m all ears!"
"Oh, I\'m sure you do have some stories!
 ...*giggle* You must tell your aunt all about it later.
 After all, George never comes to me with anything of the sort.
 Heheheh..."
This is my aunt and George‐aniki\'s mother, Auntie Eva (絵羽).
She\'s my dad\'s older sister.
She and Uncle Hideyoshi are a pair of jokers, and they\'ve always teased me back as far as I can remember.
This sometimes made them a bit hard to get along with when I was small.
...That said, I\'m currently in the process of discovering that they still are hard to get along with.
Even so, George‐aniki\'s family is interesting and fun, and they seem to get along just fine.
......Sheesh, that\'s pretty much the total opposite of my family.
"Battler‐kun,
 have you seen Rudolf‐san?"
"Huh?
 He headed off to the bathroom a while ago.
 Is he {i:still} not back?
 Heh, maybe the poor geezer dropped dead... Namunamunamu."
"That\'s no way to talk about your own father.
 Still, this isn\'t the first time he\'s taken so long in the bathroom."
"Yeah, the guy\'s always been that way.
 Does he really have to take a magazine with him every time he needs to take a dump?
 Oh, what on Earth might he be doing with those?!
 Ihihi!"
"Oh, you don\'t need to worry about that at all.
 As long as we\'re together, I won\'t be letting him do that on his own."
"Hihihi!
 Oooh, I\'ll have to get the juicy details later!
 Sounds like Dad\'s got his balls in an iron grip."
"You know exactly what would happen with that man if I didn\'t keep a tight grip, don\'t you?"
"Oh, no kidding.
 You\'re the only one capable of reigning in that old bastard.
 As his son, I\'m more than happy to let you take over."
"Yes, leave it all to me.
 After all, that\'s my specialty."
This woman is my dad\'s wife.
Her name is Ushiromiya Kyrie (霧江).
As you can probably tell from our conversation, she\'s not my real mother.
She\'s basically my stepmother.
My real mom died six years ago.
Kyrie‐san is the woman Dad married afterwards.
I mean, I\'m not a kid anymore.
It\'s way too late now for me to start calling his second wife "Mom".
And I doubt she feels like using the word "son" on this massive kid who\'s no relation to her at all.
We aren\'t little kids.
We know there\'s nothing to be gained by fighting.
So, we decided that we wouldn\'t force ourselves to pretend that we were family.
I\'ve decided to act a bit more frank with her, as though she\'s a friendly neighbor instead.
It\'s much easier to just keep a little distance, instead of forcing ourselves to act all close and making each other uncomfortable.
Kyrie‐san has been very open about all this, and thanks to that, we\'ve been able to get along pretty well.
As we were capitalizing on Dad being away in the bathroom to badmouth him,
 the man himself came back, wiping his hands with a handkerchief.
"Hmm?
 Battler."
"Hey, what\'s up, Dad?"
"...Owowowowww!
 Don\'t pinch my ear, gaah!"
"So, you\'ve been talking trash about me with Mom again, haven\'t you?
 What makes it so hard to show a little respect for your father, hmm?"
"Owowow, owowowowow!
 Dammit, that hurts, you old bastard!
 Stretch my ear all you want, I\'m still not gonna be able to fly—owwwww!!"
"C\'mon now.
 Upwards,
 upwards,
 sideways,
 sideways,
 round in a circle,
 back the other way,
 multiplier maxed out,
 with an extra x2 on top!
 Now say "Father, please forgive me for being so rude"."
"Like hell I will, go find yourself some members‐only store if you want it that much!
 Gyaah, let goooo!!"
......This old bastard is my dad.
I think I\'m pretty tall, but Dad\'s about the same height.
It\'s probably no surprise that Auntie Eva started talking about Dad\'s blood when she saw my height.
By the way, my height isn\'t the only thing I got from him.
It seems having weird names runs in the family.
Dad\'s full name is written 右代宮 留弗夫.
......Can you read it?
 Not many could, I\'ll tell you that.
That mess of characters is pronounced "Rudolf".
Haha...he must hate Grandfather for giving him that name.
Still, that\'s no reason to pass that weird naming tradition onto me.
As the old bastard twisted my ear all over the place, Auntie Eva snuck up behind him and grabbed his ear.
"Hey, Rudolf?
 Don\'t take your frustrations out on your kid."
"Gyaah, that hurts, Aneki..."
The scene before me was a perfect realization of the trope of the older sister who deals out punishment to her prankster younger brother despite his size.
"I think that\'s good enough for now, Eva nee‐san.
 I\'ll make sure to stretch out his other ear later on."
"Oh, my apologies.
 I must leave some pulling for you to do, Kyrie‐san."
"Rudolf?
 Make sure Kyrie‐san gives you lots and lots of punishment later on, alright?"
"You\'re one to talk, Aneki, bullying your little brother like that."
"Hideyoshi nii‐san, I\'d like to thank you very much for picking her up.
 If you hadn\'t been so generous, she\'d still be unsold in the store.
 You have my gratitude and apologies."
"...Hmm~?!
 Who are you calling "unsold"?"
After taking two or three steps back,
 Auntie Eva unleashed one of her beautiful high reverse roundhouse kicks, which stopped just a centimeter away from the tip of Dad\'s nose.
After starting out with Tai‐chi‐chuan for her figure, Auntie Eva had then developed an interest in the Chinese martial arts.
 After that, she went through karate, taekwondo, capoeira, ...and what is it she\'s learning now, again?
...Well, anyway, they say a woman\'s weapons are in her lower body, and that\'s literally true for Auntie Eva.
"Rudo~lf?
 Did you know that a single direct blow to the side of the head like that would knock you unconscious?
 Not so long ago, I accidentally connected in a practice match, and my opponent was out cold."
"...Sheesh, what a pain.
 Guess I have to apologize for her tendency to lash out with her feet, too."
Dad, completely unfazed, shrugged and smiled ironically at Uncle Hideyoshi.
"Wahahaha, never had a brother or sister myself.
 So, when I see you two bickerin\' with each other, it makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside.
 It sure is nice to have a big family and siblings."
"Oh, then why not consider making a little brother for George‐kun?
 He\'s already a fine adult who\'s about to go off on his own, so it might be a good time to have another child."
"Hey, have a little sympathy for the new kid and all the pain and suffering he\'d have to live through.
 I\'m surprised even George‐kun turned out as well as he did after being born from this sinister sister of mine."
"And what an awesome kid he is.
 Please share some of that with our blockhead of a son someday, will you?"
"That\'s not how it worked.
 It\'s thanks to Eva nee‐san\'s proper rearing that George‐kun became the good, gentle kid he is now.
 Isn\'t that right, Nee‐san?"
"Oh, come now...heheh, you think so...?
 Our George still has a long way to go."
"Ah, by the way, how\'s your little Ange‐chan doing?
 I heard she was vomiting?"
"Oh, that\'s right!
 And I was hopin\' to finally see her face after such a long time.
 Is she alright?"
"She often catches a cold when the seasons change.
 She\'s very frail...
 I did want to bring her along, but we decided to have my family look after her this time."
"I think that\'s a wise move.
 She\'ll be on the mend faster if she\'s not exposed to that toxic head house.
 A child\'s health is always more important than an adult\'s convenience, don\'t you think?"
"I know of some great medicine for vomitin\' colds like that!
 When we get back home, I\'ll send it over right away, so be sure to give her some!"
"Thank you very much, Hideyoshi nii‐san.
 I\'m always in your debt..."
...And once the conversation suddenly veered off in that direction, we kids didn\'t have any chance of butting in.
For now, I\'m just happy that Auntie Eva gave Dad his just deserts for tugging on my ear.
"Looks like we\'re still waiting for the weather report."
George‐aniki pointed at the counter.
The "Pending Weather Clearance" sign was still stuck next to the scheduled departure time for the flight we were scheduled to board.
According to Aniki, smaller planes are more subject to winds and other effects of the weather,
 and it\'s not at all uncommon for flights to be delayed because of that.
......Wait a sec, it isn\'t really going to shake...is it...?
From down here on the ground, it just looks cloudy, not windy.
...Well, I guess it\'s different up where the planes fly.
"The weather\'s a bit uncertain today."
Auntie Eva was looking at a TV in the lounge.
The weather forecast was being broadcast, informing us that a typhoon was approaching the Kanto region.
"A typhoon again?
 ......I guess we\'re doomed to these, with the family conference being in October every year.
 Couldn\'t he choose a better season?"
"I agree.
 I\'ve always hoped we could have it sometime around the Obon festival in mid‐August.
 In that case, why don\'t you suggest that to Father and Nii‐san during the conference?"
"...Very funny.
 Why don\'t you do it yourself?
 Our brother would never listen to anything I suggested."
"No way.
 It doesn\'t really bother me that much to have it in October.
 You were the one who complained about the typhoon, so I said "ask them to change it then",
 that\'s all."
"I only said that typhoons always come around this time of year.
 You\'re the one who said you wanted to move it nearer to Obon."
"Well, you said it too last year!
 Didn\'t you say that it would be easier to fit into your schedule if we had it nearer Obon?!"
"I\'ve never said anything like that."
"Oh yes, you did.
 I certainly wouldn\'t forget something like that!"
"No, I didn\'t... You\'re the one saying that all the time!"
"Are you aware?
 Stopping a kick just a hair\'s breadth away is a very high‐level technique."
"Sheesh, women your age should be more proper than that!"
Dad and Auntie Eva\'s argument looks no different from a couple of brats bickering...
"I expect that\'s because, although they normally act as mothers and fathers,
 they turn right back into kids again when they meet their old siblings at these family conferences."
"You\'re the one who looks like a real adult, analyzing it all calmly.
 ......I hope I never turn out like that old bastard.
 I\'d much rather end up as an intellectual adult like you, Aniki."
"Like me?
 Oh, I still have a long way to go.
 I still have very little experience out there in the real world, and I need to work on becoming more bold and sociable.
 ...I think you\'ve far surpassed me on all of those counts, Battler‐kun.
 I\'m sure you\'ll outstrip me fast enough when you become an adult."
George‐aniki scratched his head and laughed, as though trying to hide his embarrassment.
Of course, he was just being humble.
Aniki entered a university and became an apprentice at Uncle Hideyoshi\'s company at the same time, studying both academics and how to become a business emperor in parallel.
Then, right after graduating, he got into Uncle Hideyoshi\'s company as his father\'s aide, piling up a lot of real‐life experience as he devoted himself zealously to his work.
He even has grand dreams, of one day standing on his own and becoming lord of his own domain.
Aniki is a real paragon of a man, sparing no effort as he strives towards his goal.
 It\'s no exaggeration to say that I really respect him.
And then there\'s me.
 I\'m nothing at all like Aniki.
I\'m living my happy‐go‐lucky idle high‐school life to the max.
I\'ve got no dreams for the future!
I\'d like to just sit back, stay cool, and let the money flow in, but of course that could never happen.
...When Aniki was my age, he had already formed an impressive objective and had started devoting himself towards studying for that goal, so I guess I can\'t compare at all.
My dad just says "sure you can study at my company, if you like cleaning toilets".
Dammit, I\'m not gonna be in the debt of that old bastard.
I\'ll find my way myself!
.........I guess that intensity is my one qualification towards adulthood.
Should I go on one of those self‐searching journeys that are all the rage these days?
......Well, it\'s not like I could mooch off my parents for that kind of money...
"......hm?! Ohh~!"
Right then, Uncle Hideyoshi shouted out loudly.
Uncle\'s a really nice person on the whole, but he does have a problem controlling the volume of his voice.
When I looked over, I saw that he was greeting Auntie Rosa, who had come late.
"Ohoooooooooh!!!
 If it isn\'t Rosa‐san!
 Maria‐chan, long time no see!!"
"Long time no seee!
 Uu!"
"Maria!
 Shouldn\'t that be "It\'s good to see you again"?
 Greet your uncle properly."
"Uu.
 It\'s...good to see you again..."
"There you go!
 Well said!
 How about some candy as a reward?!
 ......Oh, huh?
 Where\'d I put \'em..."
"Rosa‐san, it\'s good to see you again.
 It\'s good to see you too, Maria‐chan."
"It\'s been too long, Kyrie nee‐san, Hideyoshi nii‐san."
"...And...
...oh my, Battler‐kun?!
 Look how big you\'ve gotten...!"
"Ah, come on, hahaha...
 It\'s embarrassing hearing that from every person I meet...!"
"Hey, Rosa.
 You\'re late.
 If the plane was on time, you\'d barely have made it..."
"I\'m sorry.
 We had some trouble making our train connection.
 So we\'re waiting on the weather yet again?"
"Oh, don\'t complain.
 I much prefer the thirty‐minute plane trip to spending six hours bouncing about on a boat.
 Even if we\'re kept waiting here for an hour, it\'s still much faster overall."
"Maria‐chan\'s gotten huge too!!
 So, how tall are you now?"
"Uu!
 So, how tall am I now?!"
Maria parroted Uncle Hideyoshi\'s question, looking up at her mother.
I guess she doesn\'t remember her own height.
She\'s probably right in the middle of a growth spurt, so her height must change every month.
In just a few more years, she\'ll probably start looking very feminine.
"Umm, ...how tall were you the last time you got measured...?
 She just keeps getting bigger and bigger.
 Don\'t you?"
"Uu!"
"I think she\'s grown a lot since last year.
 Let\'s see, she turned nine years old this year, didn\'t she?"
"Nine years old.
 Uu."
"That\'s right, you\'re nine years old now.
 Glad to see you\'re doing well too, Maria‐chan!"
"Up you...
...nng...
 I guess you\'ve gotten a bit too heavy to play airplane with..."
"George‐aniki, what a rude thing to say to a lady.
 Here, I\'ll do it... Up ya go~..."
"......Uu."
When I went to lift her up in Aniki\'s place, Maria stiffened defensively, staring suspiciously at my face.
...Ah, that\'s right.
 The last time I met Maria, it was six years ago, and she was only three years old.
Of course she doesn\'t remember my face.
"Maria‐chan, don\'t you remember?
 It\'s Battler‐kun.
 You used to play together, remember?"
".........Uu."
"I doubt you\'ll have any luck.
 The last time she met Battler, she was only three.
 You don\'t keep memories at that age."
She must know everyone\'s face apart from mine because she meets them every year, but I haven\'t had contact with the Ushiromiya family for about six years now.
So, it\'s no surprise that this nine‐year‐old girl doesn\'t have any memories of me.
Even I can only just barely remember her being a three‐year‐old crybaby.
"Maria.
 This is Battler onii‐chan.
 Uncle Rudolf\'s son.
 ...Understand?"
"............Uncle\'s son is...
 Uncle\'s the son...
 ............??
 ......Uuuu!!"
That "uu" was probably the sound of her brain breaking, unable to understand the complicated explanation.
I guess it was a bit too confusing for her.
"Maria‐chan.
 This is Battler‐kun.
 He\'s your cousin, like me."
"......Like George onii‐chan?
 ...........................Battler?
 Cousin?
 ......Uu."
"That\'s right.
 You got it."
This part of Aniki is what makes me really look up to him.
For someone who isn\'t married, he\'s just great at dealing with kids.
I\'m sure that he\'ll be an indulgent father in the future.
"...Battler onii‐chan?"
Maria looked straight at me with a questioning expression, as though asking whether it was alright to call me that.
"Yep, that\'s me, Battler.
 Nice to meet you, Maria!"
"Uu!
 Battler!"
"Maria!
 You mustn\'t address him without honorifics—call him Battler onii‐chan...!"
"It\'s cool, Auntie Rosa.
 I don\'t sweat the small stuff.
 Right, Maria?!
 We\'re buddies on a first‐name basis, us two, aren\'t we?!"
"Battler, Battler, Battleeerrr!
 Uu‐uu!"
"That\'s right, Maria, Maria, Mariaaa!
 Uu‐uu!!"
We horsed around for a while to make up for the six‐year gap in our friendship.
She probably still thinks of me as nothing more than a big new friend, but things\'ll probably work out as we get to know each other again.
But I\'m surprised.
 She\'s just the way I remembered her being six years ago.
Seems that people just don\'t change that much after all.
I\'m a bit happy that she\'s still the pure, innocent girl I remember.
Her name is written 真里亞.
...That one\'s not so difficult to read.
 Of course, it says "Maria".
The third character looks like a cross, which is pretty cool.
Her feelings don\'t usually show up on her face, so it can be difficult to know just what she\'s thinking, but that\'s just how she looks on the outside.
On the inside, she\'s just a sweet, normal girl.
Then there\'s Maria\'s mother, Auntie Rosa.
She\'s my dad\'s younger sister.
Rosa is written 楼座.
 ...Here\'s a name that\'s totally not Japanese.
Sorry to say it, but her name\'s almost as ridiculous as Dad\'s...
 I\'ve got to respect her for not ending up as screwed up as he is.
...When I think about it, all the names in my family sound foreign.
Just why is Grandfather so obsessed with this?
Because of him, even us grandchildren have to put up with this weird naming sense.
It\'s even more annoying since Grandfather\'s own name is perfectly normal.
Anyway, there\'s one thing about Auntie Rosa that\'s a relief compared to the other family members.
The old bastard and Auntie Eva have this annoying urge to tease and mock people all the time,
 but even though she shares their blood, Auntie Rosa isn\'t like that at all.
She has the most common sense among all the siblings.
Like Uncle Hideyoshi, she\'s a kind aunt who\'ll always be on the kids\' side.
......However, possibly because she\'s more strict as a parent, she\'s not liberal with handing out spending money like Uncle Hideyoshi is.
Alright.
 Now we have the entire group of family members who are going to board the plane.
As though it had waited for us all to gather, an announcement rang out through the lobby.
"Our apologies for the wait.
 Boarding will now commence for flight 201 to Niijima.
 We ask that the passengers please form two lines in front of the counter, behind the white line."
"Rosa, you still haven\'t gone through boarding procedures, right? Hurry up."
"Oh no...!
 Maria, come on!"
"Uu!"
We had to go through a metal detector before going out on the runway.
Our small plane wasn\'t as massive as an international flight, but it was still a plane.
 A staff member holding a metal detector checked us all.
Once all of us cleared the check, we followed the staff member out onto the runway.
Come to think of it, everyone here is in the Ushiromiya family.
It\'s like this is a reserved charter flight or something.
Our group stopped in front of the entrance to the airplane.
Then, our guide turned around and spoke, looking down at the passenger list as she did.
"Boarding will now commence.
 As I call out the names on the passenger list,
 please take your seats in order, starting from the front row on the right side and going right to left, then onto the next row.
 I will now begin reading the passenger list.
 Ushiromiya Hideyoshi‐sama!"
"Oh, I\'m first!
 Right here!
 ...By the way, do you have the candies, Eva?
 I\'ve been lookin\' all over for \'em, but I can\'t find \'em."
"Ushiromiya Eva‐sama."
"They\'re in my handbag.
 I\'ll get them once we\'re inside the plane."
I\'ve heard that candies are a good way to protect your ears from hurting due to variations in atmospheric pressure when landing or taking off.
 That\'s probably what they\'re talking about.
"...Hope I get a window seat!"
"Hahaha, don\'t worry.
 There aren\'t any other kinds of seats."
According to George‐aniki, there are apparently only two lines of seats.
Yep, it\'s a small plane alright...
 .........It isn\'t really going to shake...is it...?
"Ushiromiya George‐sama."
"Right here.
 Don\'t worry, Battler‐kun.
 It won\'t shake too much."
"Ushiromiya Battler‐sama."
"A‐Aniki, how much is "not too much"?!
 You can just swim if you fall from a boat, but if a plane crashes you\'re screwed, right?!
 We all get our own parachutes in our seats, don\'t we?
 Wait, we don\'t?!"
"Ushiromiya Rudolf‐sama."
"Come on, Battler, quit being a wuss and get in."
"Ow! Dad!
 Don\'t push me!
 We don\'t get parachutes!"
"Ushiromiya Kyrie‐sama."
"Alright, stop fooling around.
 Let\'s move along."
"Ow! Kyrie!
 Don\'t push me!
 This blockhead isn\'t moving forward!"
"Ushiromiya Maria‐sama."
"Uu!
 Forward, forward!"
"Ushiromiya Rosa‐sama."
"Maria!
 Keep quiet..."
"This is your pilot, Kawabata.
 We\'d like to thank you for taking New Tokyo Aviation\'s flight 201 today.
 We estimate that the flight to Niijima Airport will take about twenty minutes."
"We are receiving reports of atmospheric turbulence.
 There might be some shaking of the aircraft, so we ask that you do not unfasten your seat belts after takeoff."
"A‐Aniki, did that guy just say we needed to wear seatbelts?!
 In a jumbo jet, they let you undo them after takeoff!
 So it\'s gonna shake so much we can\'t take them off?!"
"Dammit, you tricked me, it is going to shake after all!
 Where are the parachutes?!
 I knew I should\'ve taken the boooooaaaaat!!"
