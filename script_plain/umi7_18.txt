"............And that...
...is the end of my tale."
"Oh,
 ......you\'re ending it there?
 But aren\'t the next two years the fun part...?"
"We don\'t need them.
 ......After all we\'ve heard in the past games about your inner conflict and how you suffered,
 you don\'t need to say any more."
"............You mean......the conflict of the furniture with incomplete souls?"
"There was a duel.
 The result had almost been decided.
 .........However, the year 1986......was incredibly merciless."
"......I\'ll bet you cursed your fate."
"Yes.
 .........If it had been one year sooner.
 ......Or else, one year later."
"The duel would\'ve been settled... Though in different forms."
Silently, Clair hung her head.
......If only I had been given time...
 Or else, if I hadn\'t been given time to think and agonize.
I curse...everything.
 Why......did it have to be 1986?
"I decided...
...to delegate my fate."
".........Delegate it......"
"Like the ritual by which I inherited everything from the previous head,
 ......I decided to put myself in the hands of that fate called a miracle."
It may be more accurate to say that I entrusted my fate to a spin of the roulette.
I—we—could not even decide our own fate,
 so we let fate decide everything for us.
Perhaps someone\'s efforts would be rewarded.
{n}Or, perhaps all would be joined and set free.
{n}Or, perhaps someone would be kind enough to put a stop to this lunacy.
"......No matter which fate the roulette chose,
 I planned to obey its ruling.
 I would not resist fate.
 ......After all, ......whenever I have tried in the past, fate has always been heartless to me........."
Clair hung her head and let a single tear drop down...
{y:0:Human}{n:0:Human}s will carelessly say that people have infinite possibilities.
{n}However, the Endless Witch......knows how limited those possibilities really are.
So, within the limits of her fate, she tried to find the infinite.
By entrusting her fate to God, she tried to find the infinite.
However, this did not mean that she abandoned her fate.
{n}Because she spun fate\'s roulette with an unshakable and certain will.
A certain fate, where absolutely no one could escape if the epitaph was not solved.
With it, she sealed up the island, herself included.
October 4th and 5th, 1986, were sealed away by an absolute and certain will,
 .........and she entrusted herself to one of the fates that could be chosen in that short span of time on that island.
".........And now,
 my confession truly is over.
 ......This should be enough to find the motive for the crime.
 .........If you still do not know, I will say no more.
 It\'s not as though...anyone could understand my heart anyway."
"Yeah.
 ......There\'s no need to say any more."
"......After watching how I wandered into a dead‐end of fate,
 ......Lion, do you see how great a hope you represent to me?"
"........................
 ............I\'m...a different possibility for you."
"The fact of your happiness makes me jealous, but to an even greater degree, it shines brightly in my eyes.........and makes me smile.
 ......You were a possible future.
 .........Right now, .........that fact is my salvation."
".........I.................."
"......Live with enough happiness for the both of us.
 I\'m glad I got to meet you once...at the end.
 .........You have my thanks,
 Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}."
".........I\'m just carrying out your funeral.
 There\'s no need to thank me.
 ......Well, it\'s about time to end this.
 It\'s about time to send the dead to the land of the dead."
"..................Yes.
 This is my funeral, after all.
 It\'s time for me to go back to where I belong."
"................................."
"Don\'t make that face.
 And please, rejoice that you are not me.
 After all, I rejoice in that fact as well."
".........I\'ll live.
 ......I\'ll live life for the both of us..."
"Thank you.
 .........Live in happiness.
 And someday, find yourself a wonderful person.
 ......I pray that you live as a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}, without awakening as a witch.
 ......That you have a whole and single soul...and love one person with all your strength...
 ......I hope you live your life like that."
"............Okay......"
"Will‐san.
 I thank you for being an observer.
 ......You aren\'t the one I truly wanted to understand me, ......but you have saved my heart."
"I...understand you.
 I don\'t ignore the heart."
".........Thank you.
 ............So, now that I have a splendid observer who understands me, ......I want to entrust my final moments to you."
".....................Are you sure?"
"Yes.
 ......For me, the important thing is whether the person understands me, not how well I know them."
......The one I wanted to understand me...didn\'t.
{n}......A person with no connection to me...did.
There\'s nothing sad about it.
 On the contrary, the fact that a person with no relation to me was still able to understand me is a miracle that I feel grateful for.
"You are a good observer...and the only one who has managed to understand me.
 ......That connection is strong enough."
"............Alright."
"I offer my heart to you, ......nameless and wonderful observer."
"..........................."
"......Lion.
 Get back."
"Huh?
 ......What\'s going to happen...?"
"A mystery story can\'t meet its death...unless the detective performs the last rites."
"............Will just stopping your heart be enough...?"
"When you mourn the dearly departed, do you put just their heart into the coffin?"
".........Got it.
 ......That which was born from earth will return to earth.
 ......I\'ll return all of you to the earth."
"Earth to earth.
 Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.
 Illusions to illusions.
 And dreams to dreams."
"..................Right."
".........Then let us begin.
 .........This is my...burial."
"Whenever you\'re ready."
"Let us start.
 ......In the manner of the end of my final game."
Light gathered at Will\'s back, and a sword materialized there.
Slowly, ......he drew it out.
Its pitch‐black tip, which could neatly slice apart truth from fiction,
 swung once, leaving a black trail, and then again, leaving a white trail.
".........I\'ll cut the truth out from the fiction.
 ............Come."
Following Will\'s lead, a similar sword appeared in Clair\'s hand.
Its tip glinted silver, the opposite of Will\'s.
"First game, first twilight.
 Six corpses in the gardening shed."
"Illusions to illusions.
 ......The corpse that cannot return to earth returns to illusions."
Will\'s pitch‐black slash cut across Clair\'s body at an angle.
The blade passed through her like she was water, ......but its tip sent golden flower petals scattering.
"First game, second twilight.
 Two corpses are close together in a locked room protected by a chain."
"Illusions to illusions.
 ......A chain of illusions can imprison only illusions."
The razor‐thin black blur sent golden flower petals scattering again...
"First game, fourth twilight.
 The old head from the locked‐room study, confined in a scorching furnace."
"Illusions to illusions.
 ......Let the man of illusions go to where he belongs."
"First game, fifth twilight.
 The last moments of the boy who offered his chest to a stake."
"Illusions to illusions.
 ......The witch and stake of illusions can pierce naught but illusions."
"First game, sixth, seventh, and eighth twilights.
 Three corpses lying in the locked room of the singing girl."
"Illusions to illusions.
 ......Illusions are the blind girl\'s song. Illusion of a locked room."
"...............Well done.
 ......Yes, you really are splendid."
"......That was a risky game from the very start.
 ......What would you have done if he\'d insisted on seeing your face and just stepped inside?"
"That\'s what it means to entrust yourself to fate."
".........And that\'s the roulette you were talking about."
"Let us continue.
 Second game, first twilight.
 Six with their stomachs split in the locked‐room chapel."
"Illusions to illusions.
 ......The gold truth locks the lock of illusions."
"Second game, second twilight.
 Even the corpses of the two who are close cannot be close."
"Illusions to illusions.
 ......Illusions who have fulfilled their role do not leave a corpse."
"Second game, fourth, fifth, and sixth twilights.
 In Natsuhi\'s locked room, none are left alive."
"Earth to earth.
 ......No one would dispute that a coffin is a locked room."
"Second game, seventh and eighth twilights.
 The two sliced to death by the red‐eyed phantom."
"Earth to earth. Illusions to illusions.
 ......No illusion can create a corpse."
Every time the blade passed through Clair\'s body, golden flower petals flew everywhere.
......Bit by bit, the petals covering her heart were being torn away.
The witch illusion......was scattering.
"Third game, first twilight.
 Six corpses connected by the linked locked rooms."
"Illusions to illusions.
 ......In a locked‐room ring, the end and the beginning overlap."
"Third game, second twilight.
 The corpses of mother and child lie together in the rose garden."
"Earth to earth.
 ......No falsehoods in their final moments as told."
"Third game, fourth, fifth, and sixth twilights.
 Three corpses lying in the mansion."
"Earth to earth.
 ......No falsehoods in their final moments as told."
"Third game, seventh and eighth twilights.
 The corpses of husband and wife lie exposed under the arbor."
"Earth to earth.
 ......The obvious culprit wields the blade of impermanence."
"Fourth game, first twilight.
 A massacring storm sweeps through the dining hall."
"Illusions to illusions.
 ......Tales woven by the gold truth return to illusions."
"Fourth game, second twilight.
 The two young ones face their trials and pass away together."
"Illusions to illusions.
 ......Tales woven by the gold truth return to illusions."
"Fourth game, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth twilights.
 None of the runaways are left alive."
"Earth to earth. Illusions to illusions.
 ......Silent corpses, adorned by fiction."
"Fourth game, ninth twilight.
 And none shall be left alive."
"Earth to earth. Illusions to illusions.
 ......Fiction locked inside a cat box becomes truth."
......Over and over again, Clair\'s body was sliced by the pitch‐black sword.
As proof, the chapel was now filled with golden flower petals, ......which danced around like gold snow.
".........It\'s beautiful............"
"Who wouldn\'t want their last moments to be like that?"
The gold snow was like confetti at the finale of a show.
{n}The curtains were finally falling on the stage that was her.
"......Then, one final question."
"............Sure."
Clair slowly raised her hands.
{n}The sword she held became golden rose petals and melted away.
She stood there, arms wide, waiting for the final strike......
"Who...am I......?"
"Illusions...to illusions.
 ......The promised reaper lowers the curtains on the tale regardless of the witch\'s will."
The wide swing of Will\'s pitch‐black blade...
......cleaved through Clair\'s form.
Blown away by a powerful gust of wind,
 ......her human form crumbled in an instant, became a storm of golden flower petals, and was torn apart.
After she was blown away, a golden heart remained in midair,
 but it too was swallowed by the vortex of wind and broke down into flower petals.
The golden vortex swirled around the chapel......
 Then, the swirl of petals gradually scattered out of existence......and vanished......
A few remaining petals danced around like snowflakes,
 and those final vestiges decorated the chapel beautifully.
.........A beam of light lit the center of the stage.
There stood Clair, whose tale had ended.
Then, slowly, ......softly, .........she faced the audience and bowed.
Applause spread throughout the theater.
The long, long tale she had just finished telling was being given massive applause.
It went on and on.
 .........And on and on.
The stage slowly sunk into the darkness of oblivion.
Clair continued to bow in front of the unending applause......and as the curtain fell, she faded into the darkness.
......People are born with sin...and live life to obtain forgiveness from someone.
Or perhaps they are born as mysteries...and live life searching for someone to solve them.
Here, all of her riddles had been solved, ......with no lingering regrets.
People are riddles.
They want someone else to solve their riddle.
{n}They live life wanting someone to solve the riddle that they are, the most difficult riddle in the world.
They want someone to look at the riddle they are.
{n}And they want that person to solve it.
For her, that wish has been granted......
.........Her soul will wander no longer.
Rest in eternal slumber......within your cat box coffin.........
Though there had been so many golden flower petals flitting about like a blizzard, ......not a single one remained.
Everything had become dust, vanished as though there had been nothing there in the first place, ......and all was silent once more.
Even the sound of rain was gone.
 The rain must have stopped at some point.
".............................."
".........Meeting you was her salvation."
"I......hope so."
"She cursed herself and her inescapable, dead‐end fate...and gave up.
 ......Meeting you, a happy miracle in her eyes, saved her in a way nothing else could.
 ......So don\'t make that face."
"...........................Heh."
"That was a pretty tasteful ending...for you."
"......Auau only told me to carry out the funeral.
 ......Well, I just called a facilitator, you, and let you do everything."
"Thank you, Will."
".........Nn."
"In Clair\'s place, I want to thank you.
 ......Thanks for cutting off all the lingering regrets...for a "me" of a different fate."
".........I thought I\'d see a bit more head clutching and blind confusion from you."
"I understand now.
 ......I realize how happy my life has been.
 ......If fate had toyed with me...and if I was living in another world, I might have gotten stuck in the same dead‐end of fate.
 ......However, thanks to an extremely improbable bit of good luck, I live in this world.
 ......I now know how much that means...how much it\'s worth."
"................................."
".........What\'s up?
 Why the significant look?"
"I thought decent witches didn\'t exist,
 ......but I might have to change that theory."
"Don\'t worry, no need to change it.
 ......I only joined that kid\'s game to kill some time.
 ......And, though I lost, I enjoyed playing."
"......That kid died without folding up her game board.
 ......I just took charge of cleaning up...as thanks to her for letting me play and because it\'s the loser\'s duty."
".........I was sure you\'d be a lot crueler than this."
"Crueler?"
"I thought this\'d be a cruel game that ignores the heart."
"Yes, it was a cruel game.
 .........Though she claimed that the game was fantasy,
 I\'ve brought you along and made it end as a mystery.
 ......The witch illusion has been spectacularly crushed, and my little bit of revenge is complete."
".............................."
"To bring an end to this tangled tale of love with absolute and certain willpower.
 ......Out of respect for that certain willpower, the Witch of Certainty made that kid a witch for just two days."
"......Even within this limited span of two days, I\'ve been able to enjoy an endless kaleidoscope.
 ......I won\'t be bestowing my favor, so no miracle will occur.
 .........However, even that ending is something that child wished for."
"......Which truth did those endless tales settle on in the end?"
"Who knows?
 ......We can\'t say for sure—that\'s what makes it a cat box."
"When you open the box, you get a tale where no trace of the mansion remains, and no one except Eva survives.
 ......And since Eva died without saying anything, all the truth is inside the cat box.
 .........Endless possibilities, all kept within a limited box."
"......Now that I think about it,
 maybe the whole island where she lived and died was the Golden Land."
"If you can call a cat box a Golden Land, that is.
 ......And of all the imaginable stories that could occur within that cat box, Battler wrote the most enjoyable."
"......You mean that book in {f:5:Beatrice}\'s coffin?"
"That\'s right.
 .........It\'s the happiest possible tale for her, which he thought up himself."
"It was a really fun, love‐filled, ......happy tale.
 ......I also think......that tale was the most fitting one to put in her coffin."
"No, that\'s wrong."
"......Huh?"
"............You heard Clair.
 ......{i:You} are her hope and her salvation.
 More than anything else, it\'s {i:you} living on in happiness that will be her salvation."
"........................
 ............Right."
"......Live happily.
 That\'s all you need to do to be that kid\'s miracle."
"Yes.
 .........I\'ll live happily enough for the both of us."
"......I\'m surprised you found this kid.
 Didn\'t you have to search through about...
two million of them in that vast sea?"
"Such trivialities are all I am capable of."
"...............Hmph."
"And now, the funeral is over.
 .........As promised, I\'ve released the barrier.
 Once you leave, time will start moving again like normal."
"So, you\'re done with us now.
 If I don\'t get back quickly, Diana\'ll start scratching the curtains."
"......We weren\'t together long, but thank you for your help."
"So long.
 Be happy...for the sake of the millions of other "you"s."
When he left the chapel, a beautiful after‐rain sky stretched out above him.
That sky, which was a mix of rain clouds, gaps of sunlight, and the tint of twilight, had a beauty to it that couldn\'t be described in words.
Will slowly descended the stone stairs, stepping in the puddles.
{n}Then, he waved without looking back...and left the chapel behind.
His form and footprints gradually faded away......until there was no trace left.
"Okay, time for me to disappear too.
 ......Goodbye, Lion."
"I have you to thank as well.
 ......I believe I said some fairly inconsiderate things to you.
 You have my apologies.
 ......You taught me something very important."
"......................................."
"......What is it?"
"No, it\'s nothing.
 ......It\'s been a century since anyone\'s thanked me, so I wasn\'t sure how to respond."
{f:5:Bernkastel} shrugged, then floated up into the air.
Then, she looked up at the beautiful seven colors of light shining in through the stained glass...
and spoke as though someone was looking down on her from there.
"Auaurora.
 Was that enough of an answer check for you?
 If you still don\'t get it, why not gather the other observer witches and have a tea party or something? Then you can listen to their theories."
"I\'m mean, so I won\'t give any more hints than this.
 There are no witches who don\'t think.
 After all, witches who don\'t think either die or turn to seaweed."
"......Now, it\'s time to go back and have a drink, ...while discussing how much of your theory was right.
 I\'m tired of playing the part of the bad guy...and of being a miko.
 You\'re done with me now.
 ......Bye, Lion.
 And bye to you too, observer witches."
{f:5:Bernkastel} burst and disappeared.
{n}A single golden flower petal glittered.
......Lion picked it up.
{n}It was the only trace of a miracle that remained in this chapel......
At that time, cheery voices could suddenly be heard.
It was the relatives.
 They came out of the waiting room, one by one.
"So this is where you were, Lion.
 I was looking for you."
"Mother.
 My apologies.
 I was just thinking about something."
"Looks like the rain\'s finally stopped!
 Finally some good weather!"
"Everyone,
 let us return to the mansion.
 I have been told that {f:5:Beatrice}\'s funeral is over."
"Father, where\'s the head?"
"He\'ll be here in a sec.
 Today was pretty crazy.
 Playing along with Dad\'s little funeral show was a real pain."
"You shouldn\'t say that.
 It was a very important ceremony."
"That\'s right.
 I think it was very important for Father."
"I\'m starving.
 Gohda‐san, think you could cook something up for us?"
"Yes, ma\'am!
 I\'ll prepare some tea at once."
".........Where is Lion...?!
 Lend me a hand."
"Our family head...! There you are."
As Kinzo came out after the others, Lion ran up to him.
"......You did very well today.
 ......{f:5:Beatrice}\'s funeral is now complete."
"Yes.
 ......And I\'m sure that {f:5:Beatrice}\'s soul was saved."
"..................
 ......How could you know that?"
"I was with {f:5:Beatrice} until a second ago.
 ......And I saw her leave on her journey with no regrets.
 That\'s how I know."
"......................................."
"......I guarantee it."
"I see.
 ............If you say it, then it must be so."
The relatives left the chapel one by one.
{n}Lion left too, giving Kinzo a shoulder to lean on.
A beam of sunlight peeked through the clouds,
 ......looking like a staircase leading up to heaven.
