The guesthouse lobby had been engulfed by silence.
The strings of tension which bound Krauss, Natsuhi, and Eva had already loosened; they were completely tired; and their consciousness was beginning to waver.
Every once in a while, they would stand up and walk around pointlessly, fighting their drowsiness.
".........Are you alright, Eva‐san?
 ...Please, do take it easy and rest."
"I told you, I\'m fine......
 ...The three of us are now the only adults...
 There\'s no time to rest...
 I\'ll guard this place even if I have to go through hell and high water......
 ......haah......haah......"
She spoke a brave line, but she couldn\'t hide her rough breathing.
...It seemed that the fever, which had been calmed with medicine for a time, had returned.
It was very obvious that Eva\'s condition was not good.
"Don\'t push yourself.
 At least close your eyes.
 If we have to wake you, we definitely will."
"I\'m telling you that I\'m fine...!
 Leave me alone......!!"
".............................."
It seemed that she had now become stubborn.
 ......Krauss and Natsuhi realized that no matter what else they said to her, in her current state, it wouldn\'t reach her ears.
So they decided to say nothing more, and to let her be.
To Eva right now, even an argument like that was putting a burden on her.
It would probably be better for her if she just sat there with her mouth closed.
As a matter of fact, Eva was already on the point of succumbing to her drowsiness.
 ...She might have talked back with a temper because she was trying to encourage herself and throw off her sleepiness.
The clock would very soon be pointing to six in the afternoon.
Because she had been snacking over and over again to fool her drowsiness, she didn\'t feel hungry,
 but instead, her lack of sleep made it feel like it was six in the morning rather than the afternoon.
......Even supposing that the boat would come at precisely nine in the morning tomorrow,
 ......there were still more than twelve full hours to go.
...That was a dizzyingly long stretch of time.
............Long.
 .........Painful......
 ......Hot...
Even the sound of the clock torments my body now.
In times like this, ......he would put his hand on my forehead, and the fever would always fade at once.
...But he isn\'t here anymore.........
As Eva\'s mind grew foggy, she was once again gripped by a deep sadness...
She had already cried herself dry.
Even so, the sadness from losing her beloved husband had not been exhausted...
"...............I...
...was wrong..."
"...Why?"
Originally, the new witch had been the same being as Eva.
...If Eva talked to her, she would always respond...
"......If I could only gain the position of family head, ...that was always enough.
 ......But as soon as I saw that mountain of gold, my greed grew.
 ............I was struck with a desire to have that mountain of gold all to myself......"
"That\'s nothing to be embarrassed about.
 After all, it\'s your natural right as the Ushiromiya family head.
 How could you give up even a bit of it to anyone else?"
"............I was gripped by that temptation, ...which is why you were born.
 ......While you are the heart of my young self,
 ......at the same time, you are also my self‐centered evil heart."
"......It\'s my foolish greed, which sprouted thanks to that mountain of gold,
 ......that allowed you to break out of the shell of my heart, ...and be born into this world...
 .........I\'m to blame for giving birth to you......!"
"In that case, when I killed Rosa and Maria,
 and then Rudolf, Kyrie and Hideyoshi, you were to blame for that too."
"Why did you kill my husband too...?!
 Why......?!!
 Uuuuuhghuuhuhhuu!!"
"...I didn\'t want to kill Hideyoshi.
 He was just so annoying and persistent.
 ...And that\'s our, no, your fault.
 It\'s your fault for choosing a husband like that."
"A child like you can\'t possibly understand how good he was!!
 Uuuughhhhuuuhuuuuuughh...honey.........uuuuuuuhhuhghhhhuuhuuhuu!"
".........Come on.
 Our dreams were made real with magic, right?
 We solved the riddle of the epitaph.
 And we found the gold and got the Head\'s Ring.
 All of our dreams came fully true, right?
 What more could you want...?"
"Those weren\'t the only dreams I had...!!
 Living a wonderful life with that man, and entrusting George with an excellent life...!
 I still have so many dreams that I need to fulfil, ...as a wife, as a mother...!!
 And yet, ......and yet......!"
"...Those are just extra dreams you gained after becoming an adult.
 They aren\'t our dreams."
"And that is why you\'re a child...!!
 It only matters that you get what you want?!
 ......That\'s right, all of this is my fault...!!
 Back then, why did I resist doing what Rosa told me to?
 Why couldn\'t I announce to all of the siblings that I had found the gold...?"
"......It\'s all because of the ugliness in my heart!!
 My evil heart, which sprouted out of a desire to have all of the gold all to myself, ......caused you to hatch!!"
".........I don\'t see why I deserve that much hate.
 Even though the both of us together make up Ushiromiya Eva."
"No, that isn\'t true anymore.
 And it was you who said it.
 I am Ushiromiya Eva.
 And you are the Golden Witch, BEATRICE...!!"
"So just disappear already!
 Witches are a delusion, a fantasy that can only exist in fairy tales...!!
 Just DISAPPEAR!
 Don\'t ever show yourself to me again!!"
"...Oh, ......so that\'s how it is.
 ...Alright.
 I\'ll disappear from your sight."
"...And I am no longer Ushiromiya Eva.
 From now on, I\'m the Golden Witch BEATRICE.
 ...So now I will play however I want."
"I\'m done caring about you.
 Why don\'t you just give up and die forever?!"
After having a fittingly childlike tantrum, the witch who had once been another Eva vanished.
......Only Eva was left behind in the darkness.
And she questioned herself...
"Was it me......?
 I......killed them......?
 Did I kill...that person......?
 ......Did I......kill...him............?"
Now, that question was one she herself would never answer......
"...g... *cough*cough*cough*!!
 *cough*cough*cough*!!"
It seemed that, half‐asleep, she had gotten some saliva caught in her windpipe just as she was dozing off.
 ...Eva suddenly started coughing.
"Are you alright, Eva?
 ...Natsuhi, some water, please."
"Y‐yes..."
"I, ......I\'m alright, okay...
 *cough*cough*cough*!
 *cooough*cough*!!
 I just...choked a bit, that\'s all......!
 *cough*cough*cough*!"
Eva pushed away Natsuhi\'s hand as she tried to rub her back, and unsteadily rose to her feet.
".........I\'m going to wash my face.
 ...Sorry, I fell asleep.
 ......When I get back, I\'ll make some more coffee.
 .........Extra strong, so that we won\'t get drowsy until tomorrow morning."
"Mm, please do.
 ......Your coffee fits my tastes more than the one Gohda makes."
"I\'m pleased to hear that, even if you\'re just flattering me...
 *cough*cough*!
 .........I\'ll be back soon."
Eva exited the lobby, heading for the lavatory.
Krauss and Natsuhi watched over her frail back...
"......So you do sometimes care for Eva‐san, even though you have always been so much at odds with her."
"........................
 ...Properly speaking, isn\'t this what an older brother should do...?"
"......Yes.
 I believe it is."
"Not just Eva.
 ......Rudolf, and Rosa too.
 ...The only ways in which I have acted like an older brother to them are to speak arrogantly and bully them."
".........In my own way, I was frantic in my desire to be like my father.
 ...But I could never match up, and I always vented my feelings on them...
 However, that is no excuse."
"...I probably scarred Eva so deep that it still has not healed.
 ......I regret it, but even if I apologized after all this time, that would not heal those wounds..."
".........If you hold on to that emotion, and continue to hold onto it,
 ...I\'m sure that feeling will come through to your siblings."
"......At this point, my only sibling left is Eva."
"...............If only...the family you and your siblings were born into had not been the Ushiromiya family......
......you might have had a more normal, a more fun sibling relationship..."
"...You mustn\'t say that...
 .........Eva will probably continue to hate me for her whole life.
 And she has the right to.
 ...I intend to resign myself to that and accept it."
".....................Dear......"
"......Eva,
 .........I am sorry.
 ......Of course, you don\'t have to forgive me..."
Of course I won\'t. Bit late, don\'t you think?
"If you know you\'re in the wrong, why don\'t you just give up and die right now and forever?!
 Do it, Chiester Sisters!!"
"45, firing permission received.
 Reconfirming firing curve, correcting for weather.
 Data link to 410."
"410, data received, firing permission confirmed.
 Nihihihihi, firing!"
Together, the sisters released the readied magic bowstring.
 A beautiful tail trailed the golden arrow, and it drew a beautiful curve as it flew.
It was just like a golden snake.
It skillfully avoided a grove of trees and flew towards the front door of the guesthouse.
Then it flew into the keyhole of the door and snuck into the guesthouse without any problem at all.
The gold snake raced down the hall smoothly, yet as fast as an arrow.
Right in front of it was the door to the lobby.
It would only need to fly into that keyhole, and Krauss and Natsuhi would be right there...
For an instant, Krauss thought he saw the door\'s keyhole sparkle gold.
However, at the same time he strained his eyes to see what it was, that sparkle bent like a whip and attacked,
 wrapping itself around Krauss\'s neck.
"...............ack.........ahkh—khk—"
Just looking at it, the gold snake looked very supple.
 However, it was as though a wire had tightened around Krauss\'s neck.
And while that snake choked Krauss, it extended even more, and also tightened around Natsuhi\'s neck.
Without even the chance to scream, their eyes bulged as they went into convulsions and then collapsed.
"45, hit and kill confirmed.
 Forming towing curve, correcting adjustment points.
 Data link to 410."
"410, data received.
 Initiating corpse towing.
 Two on the line at once nyeh, nihi!"
The gold snake began to drag Krauss and Natsuhi\'s corpses back.
......It slipped through the door to the corridor, dragging the corpses, gradually increasing in speed,
 and in the blink of an eye, it had pulled them outside the guesthouse.
So the lobby was still, as though nothing had happened at all.
...As though Krauss and Natsuhi had never been there to begin with.
Only the sound of the wind and the rain remained, as though feigning ignorance and pretending that they had been the only ones there......
"......Sorry, I\'m fine now.
 ...Now, I\'ll go make some coffee."
Eva returned from the lavatory.
But no one was in the lobby.
Even though they had been in that sofa until the very moment she had choked and gone to the lavatory,
 they had now gone, as if they had been an illusion from the beginning.
"...How careless...
 ......Where did those two go off together?"
Like she was pretending to be in a detective novel, Eva put her hand on the sofa.
......She felt a warmth indicating that they had been sitting there until a short while ago.
Maybe they had gone to do the rounds or something.
For the time being, Eva sat down and waited for their return...
Beato and George could be seen in the parlor of the mansion.
George was kneeling near Shannon\'s body as though praying...
His face was sincerity itself, and there was even sweat on his forehead.
However, Beato was the same.
 Now that she had handed her name over, most of her previous power had been lost.
...Of course, she still had more than enough power to be called a witch, but compared to the past, it was a very faint thing.
"......Good.
 Don\'t talk to her, don\'t touch her with your hand.
 ...Call to her with the voice of your heart; seek her with the hand of your heart.
 ...Only your strong feelings can make my magic reach Shannon\'s lost soul."
".................................hh."
George maintained a single‐minded focus.
He kept frantically yelling inside his heart, trying to call back the soul of the person he loved.
...He strongly envisioned his soul leaving his body, and searching for her as she wandered through Hell.
......Beato turned that strong force into magical power, supplementing her own magic.
 It was magic that, in the past, she could have performed easily, without anyone\'s help.
...But now, if she didn\'t rely on someone\'s help, she wouldn\'t be able to finish the chant, much less succeed.
".........I have forgotten after several hundred years...
 .........Was magic,
 ......was resurrection...
always this difficult of a magic......?"
An even more strained expression than George\'s had risen to Beato\'s face.
...She was still forgetting this, but the magic to revive a life is fundamentally the ultimate hidden art.
It was her previous magical power, giving her the ability to use that magic over and over with a snap of her fingers, that was abnormal.
Therefore, the heavy burden to her body and mind was, by rights, absolutely to be expected...
"......However, .........the power this one has...
is quite considerable, even though he doesn\'t know magic.
 ......I see, so he truly is Kinzo\'s grandchild..."
The strong power pouring from George was even large enough to pass as magical power.
...At first, Beato thought it was due to the blood of the mage Kinzo.
......However, that was probably wrong.
...She had a feeling that Battler had taught her that.
George\'s power to feel sorrow for the death of his loved one......arose from the way he had tried his hardest throughout his life,
 from the warm time spent together with Shannon, and from the size of their shared dream, promising each other their futures.
Do humans really live this seriously during their one single life?
......Of course they do.
 To her, a life didn\'t mean anything more than the difference between the top and bottom of an Othello piece.
If the black represented death, then she thought all you had to do was flip it over again and make it white.
However, it was just like that broken vase.
......To humans in a world without magic, where they can never return it to its original form,
 ......it is very, very natural for them to bet all their body and soul on that single life.
".........So there are times when an Endless Witch, with full command over even life and death,
 ......is inferior to a finite {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}, for whom even death\'s mountain is impossible to cross......?"
Now, the witch acknowledged it.
He was able to hold a magical power that could not reside in witches who didn\'t understand the value of a life.
......What is this thing called the Endless Magic for again?
...Even though I call myself the Endless Witch,
 have I been forgetting what the Endless Magic means...for a whole thousand years.........?
She looked at George\'s expression again.
 .........His surging earnestness was like a lightning bolt.
...Right now, even if George\'s body was burned, or smashed by a waterfall,
 he would probably continue to pray for his beloved without minding it, without noticing it.
For the first time, ...she showed respect for that power.
So in that instant, all magical resistance was lost, and the enormous power of George\'s feelings turned into magical power in its perfect form......
The vase was very, very beautiful, rich with history and value.
Even as young as I was, it still forced me to take a deep breath when I witnessed its beauty.
 ......But that just made me want to touch it.
But the vase easily fell and smashed into smithereens.
...Like a popped bubble,
 it felt as though the time when it had possessed a form was just an illusion.
It was that fragile, ......that easily lost, that life.
I realized that, because of my own foolish curiosity, I had done something that couldn\'t be taken back.
No matter how much I regretted it, no matter how much I apologized.
The broken vase would not return to its original form...
A lost life will not return to normal no matter what happens.
I was frightened by the fact that my own frivolous action, even though it had been frivolous,
 ...had stolen a life that could never be revived again.
And, out of pity for the lost life, I cried.
Out of fear of myself, who had made it become lost, I cried even more.
I was sure that Grandfather would also cry at the loss of his precious vase.
I was sure that all of the people who thought fondly of Grandfather would cry too, when they saw him like that.
By just the loss of a single life, the whole world would be filled with so much sadness.
......I cried even more at how terrible that would be.
BEATRICE appeared, and spoke.
"Then, Milady.
 Let us revive this vase with magic.
 If that will make everyone happy, then the vase and the magic and the spirits...
should be happy to lend you their power, and return it to its original form."
"Come, Milady.
 Close your eyes, and say the chant with me..."
"Come, try closing your eyes.
 And try to remember.
 What form did you have?
 It was surely a very, very beautiful form.
 Please, show me that form one more time..."
Those words of power powerfully knocked on the door to Hades.
Her previous magic had powerfully knocked on the door to Hades in the same way.
......However, back then, it was horribly violent, ...and earned the displeasure of the peacefully sleeping dead...
However, this time was different.
 ...It was very powerful, ...but it was very kind and loving.
The dead near the door opened their eyes,
 ......and called out to the other dead that there was a voice calling for someone to come back.
...The sadness of that voice calling from the outside touched the hearts of the dead,
 and trying to respond as quickly as possible, they searched for Shannon\'s lost soul...
And then,
 .........they found it.
They found the casket in which Shannon was peacefully sleeping.
It truly was Shannon\'s soul, sleeping in the land of the dead.
......Inside a casket that was covered with rose petals frozen with frost, she was sleeping in peace...
The dead silently lifted that casket up.
...While it looked like a funeral march at a glance, it had the complete opposite meaning.
It was solemn, but filled with joy.
...It reminded the long‐forgotten dead...
that they continue to be loved even after their deaths,
 ......and gave them all a warm sense of peace......
Then, ...as though guided by a warm light from the heavens, ...Shannon\'s body floated up out of the casket...
The dead watched her go.
 ......They squinted at that warm light,
 giving their respect to this unknown member of the living, who had continued to hold onto his love for a person even after her death...
Shannon\'s body was sucked into the light in the heavens, and began to disappear...
In the jet‐black darkness of the land of the dead, the faint flickering of gold butterflies could be seen.
...It reminded them of the gentle stars in the night sky, which they had long forgotten...
"........................hh!"
George remembered being told that he must not say anything, and he hurriedly covered his mouth.
However, it felt like his heart was trying to jump out of his throat.
......Because he had seen Shannon\'s eyelids shake slightly.
And then, ...those eyelids slowly opened.
 Shannon\'s eyes were there, but they were still covered in the frost of the land of the dead.
However, ......the warmth of the human world...no.
 ......The warmth of her loved one, who had called her soul back, slowly dissolved that frost,
 .........and her eyes gradually regained their sparkle.
Then, .........her eyes moved, ...and recognized George.
"......George......san..............."
As her lips shook weakly,
 ......Shannon definitely said that.
The words were very faint.
So much so that they normally wouldn\'t even have reached his ears.
......However, George clearly heard them.
.........He heard his loved one, his fiancée, the one he loved most who should have been dead,
 call his name once again...
"Shannon,
 .........Shannon.........
can you...
...recognize me.........?"
"...George‐sa...n......
 .........Is this...a dream.........?"
"No.
 This isn\'t a dream.
 ......See, look, ......even if I pinch, you don\'t wake up."
As George said that, he softly pinched Shannon\'s cheek.
......It was how George had always responded in the past, when Shannon had been surprised by something and had asked if she was dreaming.
When Shannon felt the warm touch of George\'s finger on her cheek...
......And when George realized that the warmth of a living person had already returned to the cheek of his beloved...
......They both cried.
...With what words should a pair of lovers separated by death celebrate their reunion?
 ......The words of the human world are not enough to celebrate that.
In short, they had no need of the words of this world...
Shannon sat up, and the two of them simply wordlessly hugged each other.
Shannon still didn\'t have much strength in her, and putting her arms around George\'s back took all she had,
 ......so George hugged her tightly to make up for that.
To stop her from ever again going to a place beyond his reach,
 he hugged her so tightly, and yet so gently......
Shannon\'s fingers curled around George\'s back,
 ......and on her ring finger indeed shone the engagement ring George had given her.
That strong sparkle was absolutely not the sparkle of diamond alone.
......There was, without doubt, a magical power there that only the two lovers could possibly feel.
It was because that strong light existed...that they had been able to find her casket in the land of the dead.
Beato understood.
......That ring, ......no.
............The couple\'s feelings, in the form of that ring, had created this miracle.
In that moment, George had definitely used magic.
 Beato had done nothing more than help him along.
 That magic had a magical power that could only reside in those who knew of the importance of life and trying their hardest.
It was the power of a miracle that an Endless Witch could not know, ......that only the power of the finite could give rise to.
By now, she had no choice but to accept it.
 ......She had to accept that true magic, true magical power...
...existed in the place farthest away from she who called herself a Great Witch.
".........BEATRICE...sama......"
"......She brought you back to life...
 Thank you, BEATRICE...!"
"No.
 I could not do anything.
 ......What revived Shannon...was your magical power.
 Your magic.
 ............I have indeed witnessed here the Ushiromiya blood, capable of achieving miracles."
".........George‐san was the one who......brought......?"
"...Mm.
 .........He had a phenomenal magical power, so much so that I could not reach up to his feet.
 ......So I still have not left the level of apprentice, then.
 ...Now I finally know my place."
Beato staggered backwards.
...Her physical strength was clearly exhausted.
She had humbly said that George\'s power alone had revived Shannon, but Beato had also used all of her magical and physical strength.
...And she reflected upon how difficult it was to revive a single one of these lives,
 which she had toyed with however she wanted in the past.
The couple kept each other in their tight embrace, and showed no signs of letting go.
 ...Feelings that couldn\'t be communicated with a billion words were thus communicated between them...
"Thank you, BEATRICE.
 ...We are in your debt..."
"...Thank you very much, BEATRICE‐sama.
 ......I will never forget that it was you who let me meet with George again."
"......Enough, enough.
 Being thanked by a pair of lovers is far too embarrassing for one who has been feared as an extreme savage.
 ......Don\'t worry...about me.
 ...Take all the time you want.........celebrating your reunion together........."
Beato, who was leaning her back against the wall, slid down the wall, and sat.
 How many centuries had it been since she had last grown this tired from using magic?
......Probably, not since the time I first succeeded in magic.
.........Didn\'t Master praise me for that back then?
Oh, but, I myself killed that master who praises me, didn\'t I...
......Don\'t be naive, BEATRICE.
...In the end, that\'s what it means to kill something, right...?
"......Finally,
 ...it seems you\'ve remembered how to use magic."
"...............My whole head...feels parched and suffocated, ......and I can\'t even think, let alone remember...
 ...Wait, ...didn\'t I kill you?
 You shouldn\'t be appearing..."
"You have let me live until now.
 That is why I can appear like this.
 ......However, I did not come here to pat you on the head."
"......Did you come here just to sneer at how pathetic I am?
 ......And after all this time, after retiring as a witch and everything, ...if I sit here and have my head patted, I\'ll be the laughingstock of the other witches......"
"That\'s right.
 ......Not only are you a full adult, but you boast about having retired from active service,
 so I am sure that it would be far too embarrassing to tell anyone that you only just now learned how to use magic."
"............Yeah.
 ......Keep it a secret, Masteer..."
With a sense of pleasant despondency, Beato gazed at the couple hugging each other.
"Love, huh.
 ...............I\'m no match..."
"45, data received.
 Firing preparations complete.
 Ammo selected, now loading."
"410, firing.
 Nihi!"
The golden serpentine arrow fired by the Chiesters...
weaved its way through the bushes in the rose garden,
 weaved its way through the hedges,
 and climbed the stone steps towards the mansion\'s entrance,
 aiming for the keyhole.
It weaved through the corridors,
 and flew into the keyhole in the door to the parlor...!
"......Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh?!?!"
It happened in an instant.
 ...It would have been difficult for Beato, who was completely worn out, to have noticed it beforehand.
Right before Beato\'s eyes, the gold snake that flew in through the keyhole...
spun circles around the two lovers,
 and pierced through their two hearts in a blink of an eye.
......And with meticulous precision, that gold snake ran through that hole in Shannon\'s chest once more...
The two had been pierced through the heart by the gold snake,
 ...no, by the gold sewing thread used by the new brutal witch\'s furniture,
 .........and it had only taken an instant, so unfitting for the amount of effort it had taken to revive Shannon...!
In front of Beato\'s shocked eyes, the two collapsed onto the floor...
".........G‐
......George......
.........Shannon..............."
"......Thank you,
 ...BEATRICE......
 ...For letting us meet,
 ...even just for a short while,
 ......thank you........."
George spent his last breath thanking Beato, and died side by side with the one he loved.
The gold snake, which still sewed the two in place, spun like a large cyclone, revolving around the inside of the parlor.
.........It was searching for further kills in that room.
Then, the tip of the snake met Beato\'s gaze...
In that instant, Beato prepared herself for death.
Just then, VIRGILIA stood in front of her, the fingers of both her hands drawing a mark.
In that instant, gold‐colored gold leaf buried the inside of the parlor.
It was like a blizzard of gold...
"Beato, escape while you can!!
 No one can escape from the Chiesters\' golden bow!!!"
"410, target lost!!
 Nihyah, magical chaff!!"
"45, understood...!
 Modifying enemy search: personal image homing algorithm.
 Target reacquired, data link to 410."
"410, data received.
 Too slowww nyeh, Predecessor‐samaa!!
 Here it comes here it comes here it comes,
 ...IMPACT!!"
The Chiester Sisters\' golden bow would not let its kill escape.
It would not let them block it.
...No magical barrier could even dream of blocking it without being multilayered.
The weak point during the instant of confusion caused by VIRGILIA\'s deception magic was Beato\'s only chance to escape.
And the only opportunity to make the sisters confuse VIRGILIA for Beato.
As VIRGILIA spread her arms wide, blocking the way to her beloved disciple, the gold snake pierced straight through the location of her heart...
The snake, which had snuck in through the keyhole, shot through George and Shannon, and then shot through VIRGILIA in an instant,
 completely failed to notice as Beato escaped...
As soon as VIRGILIA saw that Beato had gotten away, she expired.
......The strength left her body, and like gold dust drifting with the wind, her form was erased...
Beato completely erased all traces of her magical power,
 became gold butterflies, and passed through the wall, escaping to the wind and rain outside......
"..................Damn it,
 .........damn it, damn it...
 ......You bitch,
 ......you biiiiiiiiiiiiiiiitch...!!"
Beato felt sick from the bottom of her heart.
Why?
 Because she had been attacked by the new witch?
Probably...not.
 Of course, she also felt sick over the loss of her master.
But even more than that, Beato was enraged at the barbarism which had boorishly stolen the union between the two reunited lovers.
......Beato had poured out almost all of her magical power to reunite them.
...That miracle had been achieved only as a result of all that,
 ......yet it had taken such a short time to steal it away...!
Beato trembled at the barbarous cruelty which had ended it so fast.
......And it was also the true form of the acts she herself had committed up until that point...
So just as strongly as Beato hated the new witch, she looked at her previous self with disgust.
But now she had to escape...
......If she was targeted next, she would probably lose her life.
And it wouldn\'t even be funny if the chess player, descended like a god,
 ended up being attacked and killed by the pieces.
"45, impact confirmed, target scattered.
 ......W‐without a doubt, we crushed the Predecessor...!"
"Our pile of kill medals is gonna get bigger yeeeet again nyeh.
 Nihi!"
"What was that about loving couples?
 You get to enjoy them thrice—once tearing the two apart, once reuniting them, and once tearing them apart again...right?
 *cackle*hihihihihihhihi!"
"And I feel great about getting to say goodbye to that fussy‐as‐fuck old hag at the same time.
 ......Ronove, you don\'t have any complaints, right?"
"......Why, of course not,
 BEATRICE‐sama."
"She interfered with the ritual of the witch\'s epitaph, you see?
 She revived a sacrifice from the first twilight without permission, and interfered with my ritual.
 No one has aaany right at all to complain."
"Kuhhihihihhyahyahyahya...!
 Sucks that she doesn\'t leave a corpse behind though.
 ......I was thinking of torturing that old hag to death over and over again endlessly.
 Kuhhihihyahyahya...!!"
"........................"
"G‐George did...?!
 He didn\'t show up, when did he come down?!"
"......Wh‐when...?
 What time was that, again...?"
"I think...it was probably about four or five.
 ...It was at least an hour ago..."
"We got sleepy, and probably dozed off after that...
 But I think Jessica probably has it right.
 About one or two hours ago."
"I, I also remember it being around that time.
 Because I was asked whether I wanted more coffee..."
Something hard to believe had happened...
Apparently, when Auntie Eva had left for a second to visit the lavatory,
 Uncle Krauss and Aunt Natsuhi had disappeared.
There\'s no way they went hiding somewhere.
 Of course, the doors and windows had all been rigorously checked, and all were locked from the inside.
 Not one of them was broken.
And that wasn\'t just the first floor—the second floor was the same.
 Also, all of the doors and windows were designed in such a way that they couldn\'t be locked from the outside.
...In other words, there was no way that Uncle Krauss and Aunt Natsuhi had gone outside.
......And yet, they couldn\'t be found.
Furthermore, they weren\'t the only ones who had disappeared......astonishingly, George‐aniki had too.
George‐aniki had left saying that he was going to get more coffee,
 and had gone downstairs more than an hour earlier.
I\'d been under the impression that he was having a good conversation with Auntie Eva and the rest,
 ......but Auntie Eva, who had been in the lobby the whole time, said that no one had come down.
Since all of the doors and windows are locked from the inside,
 ...it\'s hard to imagine that they went outside.
......Nevertheless, three humans had evaporated from this barricaded guesthouse, which had become a perfect locked room......
It\'s hard to imagine any reason why they\'d hide themselves away for a surprise prank in a situation like this.
......It\'s probably appropriate to think that they\'ve become caught up in this crime...
When Auntie Eva learned that her only son was missing,
 she went half insane, running from room to room and yelling his name loudly.
...And Jessica, who had suddenly lost both of her parents, followed suit.
Cries of "George, George" and "Mom, Dad" were even now continuing to echo through the guesthouse...
I think George said something about wanting to see Shannon\'s face.
......It would be reasonable to imagine that he had snuck out of the guesthouse and gone to the mansion.
...However, I don\'t know about Uncle Krauss and Aunt Natsuhi.
...Maybe they guessed that\'s what happened, and went to the mansion to search for him...?
Without even telling Auntie Eva...?
At this rate, it\'s only a matter of time before we start talking about leaving the guesthouse to search for them.
.........At this point, I\'d be in favor of that.
We said that shutting ourselves up inside the guesthouse would be safe,
 and shut ourselves in this morning as a big, happy family of twelve people.
And yet, now there are only four people here.
 ......In other words, being here does not imply safety...
However, ...there\'s something even more important that we mustn\'t forget.
That\'s the fact that all of the doors and windows were locked from the inside.
......This is a locked room.
How had they vanished from this place?
We\'d searched around thoroughly.
However, we were unable to find any signs of anyone hiding.
...The three of them had almost certainly been taken outside the guesthouse.
".........I wonder how they did it...
 You don\'t think......there might be something like a hidden door?"
"A hidden door...?"
"...The doors and the windows are impossible to lock from the outside by construction.
 Even using a fishing line of some kind, it would probably be impossible with the way they are constructed.
 In that case, it\'s probably reasonable to think that they left through somewhere other than a door or a window..."
".........You\'re right.
 That does make logical sense.
 ......No one can be sure that no hidden doors exist.
 ...However, before leaping to that conclusion, I suspect a much simpler possibility."
"And...what would that be......?"
For some time, Battler had been opening windows, opening the shutters, and checking outside,
 and repeating this for each window.
".........Hmm.
 ...This window sure is quiet.
 ...I see, unlike the other windows, the building\'s construction means that the wind doesn\'t blow into this one."
"It appears that way...
 It feels strange that no wind or rain comes in, even though there is so much of it outside."
"Doctor Nanjo.
 ...When I opened the window just now, did you hear a sound?"
"Huh?
 ......No, I did not notice it...
 I believe it is well oiled."
"In other words,
 it would be possible to slink out through this hall window, which no one was watching.
 Furthermore, the wind doesn\'t blow in through this window,
 so the air pressure wouldn\'t cause the curtains or a door to make a sound.
 ......It\'d be quiet."
Battler leaned out and looked at the ground below.
...He was searching for some sign that George had jumped down.
......But at a glance, he didn\'t see any mark like that on the grass in the middle of the pouring rain.
"......There might also be a window like this on the first floor.
 It is possible to go outside without anyone noticing."
"However, not only the doors, but the windows too were all locked, and the shutters were even down as well, correct...?
 It is possible to go out, but it would be impossible to lock up..."
"But they can be locked, see?
 Just like this, click."
Battler closed the window and locked it, as though this was perfectly obvious.
"............B‐......Battler‐san, you aren\'t saying..............."
"If someone inside locked it in the end, this locked room is as easy as pie."
"B‐but that means,
 .........that means,
 ......ooooooohhhh......"
Nanjo turned pale and shook his head several times.
 ...Because the thing that Battler said was presenting a certain truth to him that was frightening even to imagine...
"......That\'s if they used the trick I thought of, of course?
 However, with this trick, only a very limited number of people can be suspected."
He didn\'t want to say it in front of Nanjo, ...but after eliminating Jessica, who had been with him the whole time,
 ...the only ones who could have done it were Nanjo...and Eva.
"I, ...I would not do anything of the sort...!
 Y‐yes, I can swear it...!!"
"......In this case, it would become a battle between Auntie Eva and you for an alibi.
 ...We\'d just have to suspect both of you,
 and confine the two of you separately."
".........To say it the other way around, this might be an effective trick if there were more survivors,
 but since our numbers have shrunk so much, it isn\'t particularly effective at all."
...No, in fact, there\'s a chance they could dig their own grave with it.
......It should have been more expedient to make it look like the culprit was outside,
 and to intentionally leave a door unlocked, or break a window...
"............If this disappearing act had taken place midday today,
 I\'d have probably announced this theory with full confidence.
 ...But at this stage, I\'m not confident at all.
 ............What\'s going on here?
 ...What the hell does it mean?
 .........This "locked room"......"
"Y‐......you don\'t think, umm........."
"Hmm?
 What is it, Doctor Nanjo?
 ...Even if it\'s just a thought, please say it."
Because Doctor Nanjo looked like he was trying to swallow his words despite having thought of something, I urged him on.
After he refused several times, saying that it was just a foolish idea, he finally said it out loud.
"......Well, umm,
 ............you don\'t think this actually might be...
...the work of the witch...?"
"R‐...ridiculous.
 There\'s no way witches exist."
"......The witch is trying to make her case to us.
 ...She must be showing us that she can do things that humans cannot,
 ...trying to make us accept her as a witch."
"...To me, this disappearance from the locked room of this entire guesthouse......feels like that kind of message from the witch......
 ............I must not think of it.
 Surely, it cannot mean anything.
 ...Oooh, ......I, ...I am frightened......"
As Doctor Nanjo shook with fear, it looked like he was he was trying to erase the fearsome thoughts that he kept imagining, one after the other.
......When we went downstairs, Auntie Eva and Jessica were enraged,
 and were each making a lot of noise about leaving this place and searching for their respective families.
It was a desire that naturally hits those who can no longer see their family.
Auntie Eva told Doctor Nanjo and me to stay here, but I shook my head and started walking.
".........I\'ve had enough of being shut up in here.
 ...I\'ve started wanting to breathe some outside air."
"Yeah, and if we\'re going, let\'s go right now...!!
 I\'m sick as hell of staying shut up in this place...!!
 Let\'s go and find Mom, Dad, and George nii‐san as fast as we can...!!"
The blood had all risen to Jessica\'s head.
...I hope it doesn\'t set off her asthma.
"Anyone who wants to stay behind can do that themselves.
 But we are going to search outside...!"
"What about you, Doctor Nanjo...?
 Gonna watch the place by yourself...?"
"N‐no...
 Please allow me to join you..."
If the alternative was holing up alone in a guesthouse whose security was by no means guaranteed,
 it would be better to be in a danger zone as a group of four people.
Auntie Eva was holding the gun.
 Moving separately from her was almost like asking to be made into the next victim.
In this way, the four of us decided to leave the guesthouse.
......We\'d barricaded ourselves in, saying we\'d be safe if we did, ......and then lost eight people.
It was almost as though this had been nothing more than a holding cell from which the sacrifices could be killed one after another.
We removed the chain, unlocked the front door, and opened it.
It was already pitch black out.
 While there were some lights outside which dimly lit the pathway,
 ......they didn\'t have enough power to illuminate the darkness that some suspicious person was likely to be hiding in.
"I\'m going...!
 If you fall behind, you\'re on your own, okay...?!"
Still holding her gun, Auntie Eva dashed out without an umbrella.
Jessica followed after her.
After looking at each other, Doctor Nanjo and I chased after them.
...What in the world is happening in this mansion, on this island?
Since yesterday, I\'ve just been shut up in the cousins\' room in the guesthouse with the rest of my cousins.
 So I don\'t know anything about what\'s been going on outside.
Just what has been happening in those places I don\'t know about...
outside the room, in the mansion, and on this island?
......Everything is occurring, everything is proceeding,
 ...and everything is ending without my knowing it.
Somewhere in my heart, I had already begun to give up.
...Most likely, ......not one of us will see tomorrow morning.
When the seagulls cry, none shall be left alive...
