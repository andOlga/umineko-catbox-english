A desolate wind blew through the golden rose garden......
Shannon and Kanon had already finished walking 19 steps, and their backs still faced each other.
......At the signal of the demons responsible for this trial, they would both turn.........and settle this.
Each of them held one of the dueling pistols that the demons had prepared.
The bullets......promised certain death no matter where on the body they hit.
This duel would not end...
...until one of them died......
".............................."
"..........................."
George and Jessica......just quietly watched the ones they loved...
They had already entrusted all of their thoughts to them...and their fates.
Just watching over their partners...was now the only way they could show their trust.
"..........................."
"..........................."
Shannon and Kanon......stood quietly, with their backs turned.
They had already put the emotions of the many days they had spent together behind them.
The next time they laid eyes on each other,
 ......nothing would be asked of them except pulling that trigger.
The only one who still had no determination or resolution with regard to this duel...
...was Beato.
The closer that moment came, ......the less she understood.
The love between George and Shannon wasn\'t standing in the way of the love between Jessica and Kanon or vice versa.
......Why, when both sides could find happiness, ......were they forced to kill each other...?
"......I don\'t understand.
 ......I just can\'t.........understand...!"
".........Little sister...
 We are not permitted to do anything but watch..."
"Zepar‐san, Furfur‐san...!
 Why......why this duel?!
 This is no trial of love!
 You really are demons!
 You just want to enjoy watching one of the pairs fall apart...!!"
"Quiet."
"You\'ll get in the way of the lovers."
"You\'re the ones getting in their way!!
 One will fall!
 The one who loves that person will grieve!!
 If only you two weren\'t around, no one would be sad!!"
""That is not true.""
"If we hadn\'t set up this duel—"
"Then both pairs would have fallen apart.
 This duel is necessary."
"I......haven\'t been able to accept that since the beginning...!!
 Do you think love can\'t succeed without a miracle of magic?!
 The only thing needed for love......is two who love each other, isn\'t it?!
 This duel is meaningless!!"
"So stop it, you two!!
 Shannon and Kanon both!!
 Why do you have to fight each other to the death, when you were once as close as true siblings?!
 I just can\'t.........understand!!!"
Everyone should have been able to hear Beato\'s yell.
......However, no one\'s expression changed.
"......That\'s right.
 I\'m impressed that you noticed."
"That is the truth of love."
".........What is...?!!"
"Love needs nothing more than two people who love one another."
"Therefore, when there are not "two people",
 ......we must use a duel to make that number become "two"."
"I could understand if it were a duel between two people fighting over one woman!
 If it were a duel to reduce the awkward shape of a love triangle down to a pair...!!
 But they are two and two!!
 The world formed by each pair is complete, isn\'t it?!!
 There\'s nothing compelling them to fight!!"
"The minimum number of people that can create a world is two."
"Only when two people are together can a world be born and love fulfilled."
"That is why this duel is necessary."
"So that they can reach that number of people."
"A‐......are you saying that furniture is less than {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}, and doesn\'t count as a whole person...?!"
""Correct.
 Furniture is less than {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}.
 So furniture and {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} cannot add up to two.""
"That\'s insane!
 If two people love each other, their circumstances don\'t matter!!"
""Oh, yes they do!!""
"Do you really think that the circumstances of two in love don\'t matter?!"
"Is it permissible to fall in love with a man who has a wife?
 Is it permissible to fall in love with a woman who has a husband?"
"Is it permissible to fall in love with your parents?
 Is it permissible to fall in love with your children?
 There are many situations where circumstances forbid romantic love!!"
"Th‐then just what is furniture?!!
 Why mustn\'t furniture fall in love?!!!"
""Because their soul amounts to less than a full person!""
"Shannon, Kanon, and the piece that you are as well!!"
"All of you are furniture!
 Subhuman beings who do not possess a full person\'s soul!!"
"There is only one thing necessary to love a human!
 That is the possession of a full person\'s soul!!
 That\'s why a pair in love can create a world!!"
"For example, do you think a man with a wife has the right to love another woman?"
".........Of course not.
 If he loved two women, neither would get a full person\'s worth of love.
 ......A man such as that would not be qualified to love."
"See?
 There are plenty of people in plenty of circumstances who have no right to love another!!
 As long as both people feel love, nothing else matters?
 That is a comforting lie of naive love!!"
"We cannot forgive humans who falsely pretend that they have the right to love!!
 We cannot permit the love of sub{y:0:-Human}{n:0:human} beings, of those who do not make up the minimum number of people to create a world!!"
""That is the purpose of our trial...!!
 To allow sinful souls to regain the soul of a whole person and become capable of true love!!""
"......Zepar‐sama, Furfur‐sama."
"Our hearts......are ready."
""Please, give the signal to start the duel.""
The pair bidding farewell quietly asked for the signal to be given.
Zepar nodded silently, then walked to a place that could be seen by both of them.
Furfur spoke in a voice quiet enough to avoid distracting the two duelists.
".........Watch."
"Watch the duel to see which of the lovers will fall apart...?!"
"No, this isn\'t a duel to see who falls apart.
 ......This is a duel to make true love succeed."
"......I......don\'t understand......what you two are saying...!"
"No, you must understand.
 This moment.........marks the birth of a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} who is truly capable of loving another person."
"I don\'t......understand.........!!!"
"No matter which of them wins, ......please congratulate them.
 ......This is the moment......when their days as furniture......come to an end."
"The signal is simple.
 ......I will count to three.
 When I reach three, the duel will commence."
"Understood."
"......Same here."
"If both of you miss, the duel will be temporarily suspended.
 You will be given bullets again and will start over from the beginning, with your backs to each other."
".........I guess it\'ll repeat until it\'s all settled..."
"Zepar.
 Have you seen this sort of duel......many times before?"
"Of course.
 I have seen it many times."
"......Usually, how many times do they need to face off before it\'s over?"
"In almost all cases, it is decided in the first round."
"Everyone must be really good shots..."
"That\'s not it.
 ......If one side misses, the other can corner them at their leisure and shoot.
 ......Miss with that first bullet, ......and there\'s almost no chance of winning."
"However, if you take too long, you\'ll lose before you can even pull the trigger."
".........If you\'re going to lose anyway, you\'d at least want to have pulled the trigger first."
"That is a good mindset, you two.
 .........Now, ............here we go."
"One."
"Two."
""Three.""
In the golden rose garden,
 ...when the number three was yelled,
 ......the sound of gunfire rang out once......
Even the people watching couldn\'t tell whether that was a single gun firing...
...or the sound of both going off at the same time......
In the midst of the stench of gunpowder and white smoke,
 .........there, with gun raised and smoke trailing from the barrel...
...was Kanon.
 ...............Shannon...
...was lying on the earth face down......
"......Sh‐
......Shannon...
...san.................."
"......No.
 ......Shannon dropped before the gunshot......"
"Nn.....................gah............"
Jessica\'s distressed expression...was enough to explain what had happened......
......Slowly,
 ......Shannon...
...stood up.
There was no bullet wound anywhere on her body.
.........At the time of the signal, Shannon had thrown herself to the ground......dodging the bullet.
It had been a gamble.
If Kanon had turned around and taken the time to aim carefully before shooting,
 ......then he would have shot her as she lay there.
However, ......if Kanon shot as soon as he turned around, ......she would be able to dodge it.
Kanon had also gambled.
He did not underestimate Shannon\'s skill with a firearm.
He was fully aware that hoping Shannon would be timid enough to let him shoot first...
...could result in him losing before even pulling the trigger.
So, he had decided to shoot right away.
And, he had predicted that when he shot, Shannon would reflexively pull the trigger too.
Since he was already planning to shoot right away, he was sure that his readiness would allow him to shoot with greater accuracy than her.
If Kanon had cautiously turned around,
 and Shannon had shot instantly with the strength of her will, then Kanon wouldn\'t even have been able to pull the trigger.
So, it wasn\'t that Kanon had acted hastily.
.........The two had simply given it their all, left their fates to the heavens,
 ......and reached this result.
"...................................."
".........I didn\'t imagine...
......that my quick‐tempered sister...
...wouldn\'t shoot at all..."
"I\'m surprised too.
 ......I didn\'t think that old, prudent Kanon‐kun......would shoot as soon as he turned."
As Shannon quietly pointed the barrel at him, she slowly walked forward.
She planned on cautiously closing the gap until she reached a distance from which she could hit with even more certain accuracy.
And Kanon.........had already lost any means of fighting back.
He could only try to dodge Shannon\'s bullet......and place his bet on the second round.
.........They both had that same view of the situation,
 .........which meant one could be taken by surprise.
".....................!!"
"This isn\'t......over yet!!!"
Kanon dashed forward like a tornado, bent over so low that he was almost crawling over his shadow...
This duel could only be settled by a bullet,
 ......but he wasn\'t the only one who had a bullet.
If he could steal Shannon\'s gun away from her, he could turn this all around...!
And if Shannon could calmly shoot through Kanon, it would all be over!
The odds that Shannon would miss, or that he could get close enough to her before she fired.
Kanon bet all the chips he had on these.
Shannon could draw Kanon in until the last second, then shoot him from a closer distance.
She could also pull the trigger just before he reached her, and they would start over from the beginning even if she missed.
......Shannon kept her gun pointing at Kanon\'s forehead as she compared these options until the final moment.
She led her shot, calculating the distance he had already moved and the time it would take to pull the trigger.
.........Lady Luck smiled......impartially.
"......Rrrrrraaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!!!"
"D‐damn it!!!"
In a flash, Kanon leapt to within striking distance of Shannon as she missed the final moment to pull the trigger.
He swung his hand up and smashed the gun she held upwards.
That strike sent her gun flying into the sky.
At the same time, Kanon\'s gun also flew from his hand and soared into the air.
The two guns danced a rondo through the sky, reached their peak, ......and began to fall.
By that time, neither one of them knew which gun was theirs.
The two guns were exactly the same.
 Everything about them was identical.
There was no way to tell them apart.
However, there was one difference.
.........Only one of them had a bullet inside.
The pair raised their hands to the sky,
 trying to grasp their fate,
 ......their miracle.
It was as though...
...they were trying to grasp the wings of a descending angel of miracles.
The pair looked up at the brilliant sky...
.........and entrusted everything to Lady Luck.
Then, they each grabbed one of the guns out of the air,
 and after dancing a momentary rondo, ............their arms crossed each other.
Even that was like a dance.
And the barrels of each of their guns came to a dead stop against each other\'s forehead.
"...................................."
"...................................."
Even they could not know......which gun held the bullet.
When they both pulled the triggers, ......one would die, and one would remain alive.
The match would end.
George and Jessica had no way of knowing how it would turn out until that moment came.
......However, was it really impossible for the two holding the guns to know...?
The barrel of Kanon\'s gun, which had already been fired, must have been warm.
And the barrel of the other gun, which Shannon hadn\'t fired, should have been ice‐cold.
So, perhaps the pair of them...
...did realize which gun was which.
......And yet, .........both expressions were as solemn as could be,
 ............showing that they would hold total belief and zero doubt in their own fates until the moment the trigger was pulled.
"......................................."
"......................................."
"Don\'t be sad.
 We\'ll meet again soon...in the Golden Land."
"We should have done this much sooner."
"And that way, ......we wouldn\'t have to see each other again."
"It\'s alright.
 Considering what day this is, even this duel is just a farce."
"You\'re right...
 If we\'re just going to revive in the Golden Land anyway, it really is just a farce."
"Then I\'ll see you later."
"Yeah. You too."
"So long."
"Kanon‐kun?!?!"
"Hey, what\'s going on?!
 Hang in there!!"
Suddenly,
 .........Kanon fell to the floor as if he\'d had an attack of anemia.
It happened without any prior warning, so everyone rushed up to him in alarm.
What they saw surprised them.
 There was a single strand of blood across his forehead, making it look as though it had cracked open...
"H‐......huh?
 H‐how......"
"What happened?
 ......Wh‐......what\'s going on......?"
Trying to get a look at the wound, Gohda wiped Kanon\'s forehead with a handkerchief.
.....However, his forehead was perfectly smooth, without any trace of a wound.
And yet, ......almost as though it was seeping through his skin, blood was pouring out......
"Wh‐what are you doing?!
 Stop the bleeding already!!"
"I, I would, but...!!
 Th‐there\'s no wound,
 ......but the blood,
 ......the blood won\'t stop coming...!"
"Hang in there, Kanon‐kun!!
 Kanon‐kun!!
 ......Y‐......Yoshiya‐kuuuuuuuuuun!!!"
"...................................."
Kanon\'s face was pale, ......and though his eyes were open, they had lost the light of the living.
......Just as though...
...he was a puppet whose strings had been cut,
 .........he passed away......
"Yoshiya‐kun, Yoshiya‐kun!!
 Uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh, uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!!!"
".........So long, Kanon‐kun.
 .........And......thank you."
Jessica dashed up to Kanon\'s corpse,
 .........held it,
 ......pressed her forehead against his,
 and as her own forehead grew wet with Kanon\'s still warm blood,
 ......she wailed......
"...............Shannon......"
"......George‐san.
 ......I......won.
 ......And now,
 ......I have...
......the right to love you...
.........at last........"
Shannon......leaned against George\'s chest......as though the strings holding her up had been cut.
George held her in silence......
"Yoshiya‐kun, Yoshiya‐kun!!
 Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh.........!!!
 Uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh...aaahh...aahh......"
There was nothing in the golden rose garden except the wind that carried golden flower petals...
...and the sound of Jessica\'s heartbroken wails......
"......Is your trial for us finished now?"
"It is.
 ......Congratulations.
 You two were the ones who remained."
"We will give you our blessing.
 But please, don\'t forget.
 You are now responsible for nurturing your love."
"......Please, take good care of the seed of love that this miracle has created."
"............Of course.
 ......I swear it to her and both of you."
"And now, let Shannon have the miracle of magic."
"Now, your soul will become {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}.
 You will become a full person."
""Come together, incomplete souls...!!
 Become one and know love...!!""
When Zepar and Furfur faced the heavens and yelled,
 ......the miracle of love...
...gathered the souls around Shannon.
They came from the losers of the trial.
From Kanon, who had been defeated.
And from Beato, who had dropped out.
Slowly, .........the bodies of the two began to break down into flecks of gold dust...
"......What is........."
"Wh‐what\'s going on here...?!
 No one ever said that the losers would disappear!!"
As she yelled, Beato the Elder supported the body of her fading little sister.
However, the two demons were smiling quietly.
"Kanon disappears because he died.
 Beato was born to love Battler, so without that right, she too will vanish."
"......It is very fair.
 If you had survived, the other two would have vanished instead."
"Hang in there, little sister, hang in there!!
 Weren\'t you going to solve Battler\'s locked room and save him?!
 What are you doing, biting the dust in a place like this?!!
 You call yourself a part of our complete form?!!"
".........Why...
......was I born for the sole purpose...
...of loving Battler‐san......?
 ......Why...
...do I like him...?
 The truth is,
 ......I don\'t know...
...why I fell in love with him."
"Wh‐...what?!
 You want to talk about that now...?!!"
"......After all,
 ......when I was born,
 .........I was told to love Battler‐san and be loved by him...
 That was the purpose of my birth.
 .........So,
 ......I don\'t really know...
...{i:why} I like him......"
"P‐people don\'t need a reason to fall in love!!
 Don\'t disappear!!
 If you disappear, who will save Battler?!
 Little sister, Beato!
 {f:5:Beatriceeeeeeeeeee}!!"
............Why...
...is it...
...that I like Battler‐san...?
{a:c:
......“Mother”?}
"Well, you know,
 I\'m not really a big fan of the domestic type of girl.
 You know me, I\'m a rough‐around‐the‐edges kind of guy, right?
 ......I just can\'t handle acting politely in front of girls, ladies first and all that stuff.
 ......So, if I had to say what type I liked......"
"......You know, maybe a Jessica‐type girl could be just my thing.
 If I\'m crude, why shouldn\'t she be too?
 ......A rough, relaxed relationship with someone who can cuss and joke around with me, so we\'re not always thinking about how I\'m a guy and she\'s a girl—that could be just perfect!"
"So if I ever get a girlfriend,
 ......I\'d like someone I could joke around with all the time like I do with Jessica...!"
"Huh?
 What would she look like?
 I\'m not too picky about that.
 But if she {i:did} happen to be one of those blue‐eyed blondes with big boobs you see in Western films,
 ihhihihihihihi, that\'d be awesome.
 I\'d love to rub those boobs!
 Wahahahahahaha...!"
{a:c:――{f:5:Beatrice}.
Listen to me.
I am giving you my love for Ushiromiya Battler.
You are to become the kind of woman Ushiromiya Battler desires.}
{a:c:You will have the golden hair he likes.
You will have the blue eyes he likes.
You will have a personality that matches his.
And then, ......you are to love him in my place,
and if fate allows it, be loved by him.}
{a:c:I.........can no longer love him.
Please, take these desires I couldn\'t bring to fruition,
......these feelings too great for me to bear,
......and see them through yourself.}
{a:c:From this day forward,you are no longer the Rokkenjima ghost that lives only to play pranks.}
{a:c:From this day forward,you will be the master of this island,waiting for the day that he comes to fulfill his promise.}
{a:c:From this day forward, you will do this in my place.
So, from this day forward, you will no longer be me.}
{a:c:Please forgive me for pushing all of my troubles onto you,...while I alone try to find happiness.}
{a:c:From this day forward, you have the right to hate everything.
From this day forward, you are the Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}.}
{a:c:And, one day,
you will destroy everything, revive everything,
......and bring blessings to all lovers.}
{a:c:When that day comes,
......I pray that you and I will both have found happiness.}
{a:c:From this day forward, you will no longer be me.
From this day forward, I will no longer be you.
The two of us will split a single soul and share it.
And though, of course, that won\'t amount to a complete soul...
I\'m sure our dreams will be more numerous than most.}
{a:c:Let us be blessed.........
My darling...{f:5:Beatrice}.........}
{a:c:No one else can see your form.
But I can.
And if you\'re loved by a lot of people,
I\'m sure they\'ll all start seeing you too.}
{a:c:We can all {y:1:‘see’}{n:1:see}...if we have love......}
".........Yoshiya......kun.................."
"...A‐
......are we...
...dre‐...
...dreaming......?"
"I‐......insane...
 What kind of joke is this...?? Well?!"
"D‐D‐Doctor Nanjo!!
 I\'ll go call Doctor Nanjo...!!"
"............Gohda.
 ......That is enough."
Genji, who had been calm and silent through the whole thing, finally spoke.
And those......were the most reasonable words spoken.
......If he called Nanjo here,
 ............then what...?
Not only was there no arm to take the pulse of,
 .........there wasn\'t even a forehead to feel the heat of.
......Like the last unmelted snow greeting the warm sun of spring,
 ...Kanon\'s form...
......There was no longer...
......even a trace.
His form...
...had sparkled with a spray of gold...
...and vanished completely......
"......Where...?
 Where did he go?!
 Where\'s Yoshiya‐kun?!
 Yoshiya‐kun, Yoshiya‐kuuuuuuuuuuun!!!!"
".........So long,
 Milady.
 ......No, ............Jessica."
"......Kanon‐san........."
"No one\'s eyes can see us any longer.
 ......That means that we are no longer in their world.
 ......However, we are right here."
"............You\'re right.
 ......We......are here."
"For us, a body is nothing more than a cage made of flesh.
 .........There\'s no need to be sad."
"......But, .........I do feel sad for her.
 ......Jessica‐san..."
"This is all......my sin.
 ......This is why furniture isn\'t supposed to love."
"..................What will you do now?"
"Though I have lost my form,
 ......though I can no longer talk to her,
 ......and even though if Jessica ever talks to me...
...I can do nothing except nod behind her back,
 .........I will be by her side."
"...........................
 ......I think that\'s wonderful."
"What will you do...?"
"......I want to save Battler‐san...from a locked room......"
"A locked room...?
 Ha......hahahahahahahaha."
After looking a bit taken aback, Kanon laughed gently.
Beato, who hadn\'t expected to be laughed at, looked a little sour.
"Wh‐why are you laughing...?
 This is very important to me..."
"But it\'s a locked room.
 .........That\'s only a problem for humans who have bodies."
"......Huh?
 ............Ah..."
"We have already been released from our cage of flesh.
 ......How could a locked room hinder us?"
"......A‐are you sure about that...?
 I mean, there\'s a chain lock, and duct tape seals, and red truth...!"
"I see.
 ......So, you weren\'t from the world of pieces, ......but a being from a higher‐level world.
 ......That\'s probably why your limitations are different from ours.
 ......Ah, well."
Kanon stretched.
......It looked as though he was about to head out somewhere.
"......Kanon‐san......"
"Seeing as you\'re a fellow loser,
 .........okay.
 I\'ll go for you.
 I\'ll go to the guest room in the mansion, let Battler‐sama out,
 set the chain behind me, and hide in the closet in his place.
 ......How about that?"
"I, I\'m glad for the sentiment...
 But even if you wanted to leave the cousins\' room, ......Erika‐san\'s seals mean..."
Unlike the next room over, the cousins\' room where Kanon was had been guaranteed to be a complete locked room, even counting the windows.
Not only did he have no way to save Battler, but he couldn\'t even escape himself......
".........In that case, use your magic to give me power."
"My......magic.........?"
"Yeah.
 Use your magic on me."
"W‐wait......
 I don\'t even know how......"
"Aren\'t you {f:5:Beatrice}, the Golden Witch...?"
"I am a witch, but.........ummm...
 I don\'t even know about locked room tricks, much less magic......"
"Good grief......
 Okay, listen up, {f:5:Beatrice}.
 .........I\'ll only tell you this once.
 This is what a witch is."
"What a witch is.........?"
{a:c:
A witch is...}
"Not the one who solves puzzles."
"......Not the one......who solves puzzles......?"
"Yeah, that\'s right.
 If you\'re a witch, why are you clutching at your head because of someone else\'s puzzles?
 ......That\'s not a witch\'s job, right?"
"Th‐......then, ......what is......a witch\'s job......?"
"The Golden Witch I know...
...used insane magic to create puzzles that baffled everyone and sneered at their confusion.
 ......Create a horrible riddle that no one can get, spin everyone around, and bad‐mouth them.
 You aren\'t supposed to clutch your head agonizing over your opponents\' puzzles. That\'s {i:their} job."
"Agonizing......is my opponents\' job......"
"Don\'t worry about how to get Ushiromiya Battler out of the locked room.
 ......A room locked by a chain?
 What a joke.
 ......You need to create a much more spectacular, ultimate locked room...
and make it so that they\'re the ones agonizing.
 .........I\'ll even lend a hand."
"I\'m......not the one who agonizes......"
"That\'s for them to do.
 It\'s about time they recalled the true terror...
...of {f:5:Beatrice} the Endless Witch, the one who can create endless locked‐room tricks of the most horrific kind,
 tricks that can make even the demons of hell prostrate themselves in shock...!"
".........A locked room.........even more horrific than Battler‐san\'s..."
"We\'ve already gotten our hands on one, haven\'t we?"
"A...horrific.........locked...room......"
{a:c:
.........ah...}
In the back of Beato\'s mind,
 ......images she remembered began to flit by, one after another—
the layout of the mansion, the guesthouse, the rose garden......
Trick. Mistake. Mislead.
Taunt.
 Trap.
 Laugh together.
......Do you know about this trick...?
It was in a book I read once......
Beato\'s eyes opened wider and wider......
Countless lights circled around her, swallowing her up.
"And one more thing."
"......Wh‐what...?"
"That\'s no way for the witch of locked rooms to talk."
"Then, you think I should......"
"Go for "warawa"."
