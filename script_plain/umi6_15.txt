The entrance to the mansion was locked, but Erika had a master key, so she opened it without any trouble.
She had gotten Krauss and the others to take the master keys from the servants,
 and at that time, she had used a little sleight of hand to pilfer one of them...
"Well THEN.
 Where shall we go FIRST?"
"Why ask?
 ......Let\'s go and hear Battler-san\'s answer."
Grinning, Erika cut across the entrance hall, passed by the dining hall, and headed deeper and deeper into the mansion.
......She headed for the guest room Battler had lain dead in.
Battler could put off deciding whether the seals would remain intact or not until the moment right before Erika witnessed them.
However, once she did witness them, ......the Game Master would have to show what had happened to them.
In the witch\'s game they were in now, ......the simple act of going to check the seals around the guest room was an attack.
".........Are you ready, Lord BATTLER?"
"Yeah.
 ......Or as you would say it,
 ............come, step forward."
"<Good>!
 Then allow me to examine your response.
 So, let\'s see, ......are the seals broken or are they not?
 Has the locked room been preserved, ......or has it not...?!"
The piece Erika held high in the air......was the white queen, which represented herself.
Her target......was Battler\'s territory.
 She cut straight in...!
Erika dashed down the hallway with a sickening smile and clung to the guest room door like a spider.
Then, she closely examined the seals she had placed retroactively.
"............Heh...
...heheheheheheheheeheheheheheehheh!
 ......Are you sure...?
 .........Are you sure,
 ...Battler-saaaaaaan...?!"
"I-......is this alright, Battler-san...?"
"......Yeah, I can\'t back down here.
 ......After all, even if I\'m sealed in here, ......there are ways of placing the letter."
"But Erika is probably about to enter the guest room.
 And then, she will observe your dead body.
 ......What are you going to do?!
 If the body is there, then there\'s no problem.
 ......The letter\'s prediction will have missed, but it\'s not as though there\'s a penalty for that.
 ......But you......intend to fight this head on...!"
"There are times...
...when a man is challenged head on...that he has to respond, no matter what it is he\'s up against."
"......I must not...pull back here.
 .........I\'ll take this challenge.
 I can search for a way out all I want to later...!
 I managed to do that with Kinzo\'s study last time...!
 .........It\'ll be fine... I can do this...! I can do it!!
 Do your worst, Erikaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!"
"
We have confirmed that the seals to the guest room are UNDAMAGED.
 Since the time Lady ERIKA confirmed Battler\'s presence, this locked room has been PRESERVED."
"<Good>!!
 I\'m breaking the seals!!
 Rip, tear!!
 Heh, hehihihihihihihihihihihi!!!"
Erika destroyed the duct tape seal on the door in ecstasy...
It looked as though the intellectual rapist had finally laid her true nature bare.
"......Okay,
 ......I\'m opening it......
 Show me,
 ......Battler-san,
 ......your naked scenario...!!
 Hehihihahahaahaaaaaaaaahhh!!!"
Like a ruffian pushing down a weak girl,
 ......Erika mercilessly and greedily threw the door open.
Then, finally, ......the inside of Battler\'s guest room was observed by Erika.
Battler had to show it.
.........Was there a corpse, or wasn\'t there?
"<Come ooooooooooooooon>, Battleeeeeeeeerrrrrrrr!!"
"Aaaaaaaaaaahhh, here\'s my respooooooonse!!"
Battler grabbed a black piece from the board and raised it high.
......Aah, ......that piece.........
Beato had no memories of the time she had been an expert at this game.
And yet, ......for some reason, she realized that this was a move from which there would be no coming back.
Once a piece was moved, it couldn\'t be taken back...!!
Uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh!!
......The guest room was covered by a silent darkness.
It was pitch black, and nothing could be seen.
 ......However, there was a light switch just off to the side of the entrance.
If that was pressed, the room would be lit up, and everyone would see whether or not there was a corpse on the bed.
".........Should I turn on the LIGHTS?"
"No, ......wait a second, please.
 .........Battler-san, I have a proposal."
"............Let me hear it."
"I think you already know,
 ......but this time around, I am not after the classic sort of victory of identifying the culprit.
 ......My enemy is not the lowly culprit killing the pieces, .........but my opponent, you yourself."
".........I know.
 ......So, ......you\'re after a logic error."
"Heheh......"
"......I\'m seriously regretting it now.
 ......You were acting so miserable that I fell for it completely, ......and I gave you a ridiculous privilege."
".........It was your ARROGANCE.
 ......It will cost you DEARLY."
"..................Damn......it......"
"......So, ...what is your proposal?"
With a firm voice, Beato urged her to continue.
Until just a second ago, she had remained behind Battler\'s back, a bit flustered.
......However, she was steady now.
......She saw that Battler had let his emotions take control and had been lured into making a bad move...
...and realized that it was time for her to stay cool and support him.
Erika\'s proposal couldn\'t be anything good.
And on top of that, Erika was sly.
She probably wouldn\'t make a proposal that would be easily rejected...
"In a moment, I will turn on the light.
 The top of the bed will be lit up, and it will be decided whether or not Battler-san has disappeared as the letter predicted."
"......If he\'s there, great.
 There\'s nothing strange at all.
 The letter\'s prediction would just be wrong.
 ......Of course, the argument would probably switch over to "then who put the letter there?",
 but for the time being, the location of the fight would move outside this locked room."
"........................And...if he\'s missing...?"
Beato already knew.
She knew the move that Battler had made a second ago.
......Battler had......already disappeared from this room......
Therefore, they would need to prepare a different disappearing trick,
 one other than "he was actually alive and left through the door".
The situation is simple.
First, this room is a locked room.
Also, Battler\'s life or death status has not been confirmed.
In other words, it would pose no problem if he was alive.
Under these conditions, they had to make Erika think that Battler disappeared.
He could escape from the room,
 ......or if that\'s impossible, he could hide somehow and wait for her to leave, making her think that he disappeared.
"Inside this tiny room,
 ......I will begin our endgame,
 ......the chase after the king.
 It will be over in just a few moves.
 You\'ll be unable to construct the logic needed to allow Battler to escape from this room,
 .........and the tale will be destroyed - game over."
".........Fighting to keep that from happening is our job.
 ......What is this proposal of yours?"
"An endgame fought over a logic error should be a bit more precise.
 ......Once again, we will fight with the red and blue truths,
 but we need a judge on the same level as the Game Master to observe and see that he doesn\'t create any logic errors with the red truth."
"......Th-that seems reasonable."
"There\'s nothing special about this.
 ......Back when the old you was the Game Master,
 you were under the observation of your guardian, Lady LAMBDADELTA.
 She judged all your red truths to be valid."
".........So, you\'re telling us to show LAMBDADELTA our cards?"
"I\'ve been looking at them since the beginning.
 ......It\'s okay, don\'t worry.
 I\'m impartial in my judgments."
"C-can you say that with the red truth...?"
"Yep.
I swear that I am impartial in my judgments.
 .........I was very impartial in the last game, wasn\'t I?"
"......That goes double for trials where things will be interesting either way, doesn\'t it?
 .........Accept her challenge, Battler.
 Erika is going to corner you.
 Understand?
 .........She will duel with you and kill you in this room.
 ......If you\'re a man, accept the duel......!"
"S-......sure, fine.
 .........We won\'t get anywhere if every single impossible murder I present is accused of being a logic error.
 ......It\'s true that we need an impartial observer to guarantee that the game is legitimate."
"Then I\'ll come around to your side.
 ......Let me take a look at your hand.
 ...............Hmmmmm......?"
LAMBDADELTA understood what Battler had up his sleeve.
......And she confirmed that Erika\'s first move had indeed gone straight through his heart.
Just as Erika had guessed,
 Battler was alive, and after Erika had examined his "corpse", he had slipped out of the room,
 ......placed the letter by the guesthouse, and hid himself somewhere.
Once the duct tape seals were retroactively placed on the guest room,
 ......he suddenly became required to show that they had been torn.
However, if he had done that, it would have been the same as admitting that he had been seen through and that he had lost.
Unwilling to admit that, Battler had claimed that the seals had been preserved, with false courage,
 and was now rushing to revise his logic.
True, he could still escape for a few more moves.
......However, Erika was planning to corner and kill him here...
"......Battler.
 ......You\'re fighting with some pretty incredible cards here."
"Cards...?
 ......Does this game of chess look like a card game to you?"
"......To me, it\'s always looked like you were playing a game of poker.
 So, by moving to this side and looking at the cards you hold, I understand everything."
"...............This is an awful hand.
 It\'s basically the lowest-ranking hand there is...
 And Erika knows that\'s exactly what you have."
"............Heheh...
 What would you do?"
"I\'m the judge. I can\'t give you advice.
 ......But let me tell you my impressions."
"No, that\'s okay."
"......This hand gives me the tingles.
 ......You\'re...intending to use this "nothing" hand...
...and a big wager...
...to bluff Erika into folding, aren\'t you...?
 ......She\'s not going to fold, you know.
 ......If anyone should be surrendering their chips and folding now,
 ......it\'s you..."
"......Thanks for the advice.
 .........Battler-san.
 I agree with her.
 ......Let\'s back down from the fight in this room.
 We don\'t have any winning cards..."
"Are you hoping for a card change to turn this hand into something half decent...?
 ......But you\'re playing chess, aren\'t you...?
 In the world of chess, ......if you rely on luck, ......you die......"
By "hoping for a card change",
 .........she meant relying on luck and hoping that, even though he couldn\'t think of anything now,
 he might later be able to think of a good plan for how to make this locked-room trick hold up.
Battler, if you start this battle...
...without a trick up your sleeve,
 .........you\'re marching to your death...!
If you ever plan to back down, it has to be now.
When Erika presses the light switch,
 ......you just have to be lying on the bed.
......That\'s......all there is to it!
"......Lambda.
 I don\'t know what you\'re talking about, but you\'re chatting too much.
 A judge needs to be impartial."
"True......
 ......Then, good luck, Battler.
 ......I\'m hoping for a precise, chess-like battle.
 ......You aren\'t......playing poker, remember......"
"Are you ready, Battler-san?"
"Yeah, I am......
 ......Turn the lights on whenever you want."
"For the rest of the fight in this room, the progression of time will be stopped.
 This way, all the moves for both players will be made at the same time,
 and the first move made will be treated no differently than the last move.
 ......It might be difficult to understand what I mean, but this is a rule to protect the logic,
 and it will protect you as well."
"......From here on out, you will be rebuilding the trick in this room using all the twisted logic you want.
 ......And that means it\'s possible that you might think of a good idea partway through the fight."
".........Normally, it\'s unfair to revise your plot partway through.
 In order for that to be acceptable, ......you need a world where logic thought up "after the fact" does not come "too late" - 
a world stopped in time, where everything happens at once."
"Of course, Erika can take advantage of this rule as well.
 ......If you revise your trick to be a new one, she can deal with that in a different way."
".........This is pretty complicated..."
"It\'s simple.
 ......It\'s like a corrupt politician\'s war of twisted logic.
 ......You lie shamelessly.
 When evidence is shown revealing your lie, you retract it,
 say that you just remembered wrong, then change to a new lie that doesn\'t have any contradictions."
"......The fight goes between a lie, then evidence exposing it, then another lie,
 ......like a fight between two snakes spinning around trying to eat each other\'s tails."
"<Good>!
 ......Just think of it as a world in which you\'re allowed to use twisted logic based off of your opponents moves as often as you want.
 ......I used that myself when sealing this room.
 So, I thought it was only fair to let you do the same."
".........You have no shame, do you...?"
"OK!!
 Then, both players, begin!
 Erika goes first, right?
 No, maybe we start by checking the bed - see what Battler\'s staking on this?!"
"Yeah, let\'s start by checking the bed for Battler.
 ......Erika, begin."
"Leave it to me, my master!
 <Light>...<on>!"
With a click,
 ......the sound of the light switch rang out,
 ......and the bulb turned on, lighting up the room.
......Battler\'s bet...
...on the bed...
...was......
".........Dlanor.
 Confirm it with the red."
"YES.
 ......Ushiromiya Battler - "
"No, it\'s my move.
 ......I\'ll say it.
 ...............
Ushiromiya Battler is not on the bed."
"<Good>.
 .........You did well not to run away from the fight.
 I\'m impressed."
"......It\'s a high-stakes battle, so it\'ll cost you a lot if you\'re the one who loses.
 I hope you\'re ready..."
"*giggle* No one would raise the stakes unless they felt confident in their advantage."
"......Dlanor.
 Keep a record."
"As you WISH."
At Dlanor\'s nod, Cornelia, who was hanging back, started taking a record.
She wrote down that Battler\'s corpse, which should have been on the bed, was not,
 ......and also that Battler hadn\'t backed down from this locked-room game...
"As previously announced, Battler\'s first move is to have the corpse vanish.
 ......Now it\'s Erika\'s turn.
 Go ahead."
"......I present the possibility that Ushiromiya Battler is alive and hiding somewhere in this room.
 I proclaim this with the blue truth."
"Invalid.
 If you want to use the blue truth, give me a specific location."
"......Pfft.
 ......In the last game, Beato did that in Kinzo\'s study,
 and Dlanor made Swiss cheese of her, right...?
 I guess this is revenge...*giggle*..."
"Before I start searching, I have one blue truth I can use without a search.
There is a possibility of a hidden door X that is impossible to discover.
 He\'s hidden behind that, so it is impossible for me to find him."
"
Knox\'s 3rd:
 It is forbidden for hidden passages to exist.
 ......That right?"
"......
No hidden places that are impossible for Erika-san to find exist inside the guest room."
"Knox\'s 3rd, ......VALID."
"<Good>.
 ......Then let\'s get started with the search."
......Erika slowly began to walk around the room......
Until the endgame had started, Erika had been energetic,
 jumping about impatiently like a hungry dog.
However,
 ......now that it had actually begun...
......this was a stifling battle of wits...
.........where each breath made her tense...
Even the quiet sound of the rain......was distracting......
"Now that I\'ve searched the room, I request a description of its layout."
"......The guest room is divided into two rooms, the bedroom and the BATHROOM.
 Currently, you have searched the entire bedroom SECTION.
 There is only one EXCEPTION."
"............I\'ll leave that one place be for the time being.
 So, were there any irregularities discovered in the bedroom?"
"There were NONE.
Except for one location, there is no one to be seen in the BEDROOM."
"......What\'s this "except for one location" business?
 Stop being annoying and make it public."
"There\'s a reason a face-down card remains face down.
 ......I\'ll turn it over if it\'s needed, so look forward to it. ......*giggle*."
After thoroughly checking the bedroom, ......Erika headed for the bathroom door.
Since he wasn\'t in the bedroom, it was natural to think that he was in the bathroom.
And, since the guest room was made up of two rooms, if Battler wasn\'t in the bathroom either,
 ......it would mean that he had managed to vanish from the locked room.
.........Except for that single location which Erika had intentionally left unchecked......
"I\'m checking the bathroom."
"......Lady ERIKA.
 ......The sound of water can be heard from INSIDE.
 Also, there is a faint HEAT."
"Ooh......?
 ......Don\'t tell me he\'s taking a shower...
 Is it locked or anything...?"
"No, it isn\'t locked.
 Go ahead and open it."
"......Then, if you\'ll excuse me."
Slowly, ......Erika put her hand on the doorknob on the bathroom door......
......She tried to push it open, but felt a strange resistance.
Of course, it wasn\'t the resistance of the lock.
......It felt......as though it had an unnatural load on it......
Out from the slightly open crack poured the hot air from the shower.
However, it was unlocked, so there probably wasn\'t anyone taking a shower.
After letting a dumbfounded expression rise to her face, Erika slammed into the door with her whole body, knocking it open...
"Hyaa?!
 Wh-...what?!?!"
As soon as she opened the door, a tempest of hot air and water blasted her.
Erika was thrown for a loop, unable to understand what had happened.
After falling backwards on her butt, she realized that boiling hot shower water was spewing out at her, and hard.
"Wh-
......what is this......?
 ......What a screwed up.........prank......"
Cursing, Erika wrapped the blanket from the bed around herself, and tried to enter the bathroom once more.
This time, she was able to figure out what was going on.
It was......an elaborate prank.
A wire fixed the shower nozzle in place so that it pointed at the entrance.
The pressure and heat were turned up to the max,
 so that anyone who went through the door would be met with a wave of hot water.
The pressure was very strong, which probably accounted for the weight she had felt when trying to push the door open.
She tried to make the nozzle point in another direction,
 but not only was it fixed in place by the wire,
 it was also fixed in a place high enough that Erika couldn\'t reach it with her height.
She tried to turn off the pressure, but that was also held in place by wires.
She couldn\'t manage anything with her bare hands.
 She would have to get a tool that could cut the wires.
However, when she glanced into the bathtub, which was filled to the brim with very hot water,
 she saw a bundle of wires and a pair of nippers that had been used to cut them lying at the bottom.
If she used those, she could turn off the pressure...
"......Ah, owowowowowowow!!
 ......Damn you...!!"
The blanket she had used to protect herself from the shower became more and more drenched with boiling hot water.
At this rate, she\'d get burns even through the blanket.
She needed to turn the water off quickly...!
Looking next to the bathtub, she spotted a long-handled body brush hanging there.
......Perfect...!
Erika used that to skillfully scoop the nippers up off the bottom of the tub.
Fortunately, it was a shallow Western-style bathtub.
If it had been a deep Japanese one, it would probably have burned her badly.
Making sure not to touch the hot metal parts, she carefully took the nippers...
...and cut the wires around the faucet...
......Take that, ......and that......!
"Haah, ...haah!
 Haah......haah!!"
She finally closed the faucet and the heat from the hot water storm died down.
......For a while, Erika was forced to cool her almost burnt arms under running water...
"......What a CALAMITY."
"Would you like a bath?
 I can wash your face with this brush."
"Allow me to PASS."
"Oh. ......That\'s a SHAME."
Erika had finally regained enough of her composure to be abusive......
She closed the faucet completely, ......and silence returned to the bathroom.
After that, all that remained was Erika\'s heavy breathing.
She turned on the fan to get rid of the hot steam.
She left the bathroom for a moment until that was finished.
......It was pleasant, like stepping into an air-conditioned room on a hot summer\'s day.
".........Now that was a ridiculous trap.
 ...However, that wasn\'t here at the time I examined Battler\'s "corpse".
 Therefore, the appearance of this trap proves that Ushiromiya Battler was alive.
 ......Well, I never thought he was dead anyway."
"......He merely decided to openly reveal a card that had already been EXPOSED."
"Let\'s check the inside of the bathroom.
 Was Battler seen?"
"NO.
No one was seen in the BATHROOM."
"<Good>.
 With this, we...
have confirmed that except for one location, Battler does not exist in any place inside the guest room."
"......Give that a rest.
 Just where is this one exception?"
"A coffin.
 .........Ushiromiya Battler\'s coffin, that is."
"......Ashes to ashes, the dead to their COFFINS."
".........This room is where you plan to finish me off, right?
 ......Fine.
 Let\'s have it."
The previous period of silence, complete except for the rain, .........was suddenly replaced by the overpowering smell of a burning fuse.
Though it was extremely quiet,
 ......the room was filled with tension......as though you could be sliced in half if you relaxed for an instant.
A cloud of gold butterflies gathered on the room\'s round table......and turned into a witch\'s chess board.
It was finally.........time for the siege.
"Blue truth.
You did not vanish from this room.
 You just hid yourself to make it seem as though you\'d disappeared from a locked room.
 The place you are hiding......is the "one exception" that I haven\'t investigated yet."
As Erika lightly raised her right hand, ......
a single gold butterfly appeared from the darkness behind her,
 ......flitted between the index finger and middle finger of Erika\'s raised hand, and became a white piece.
Then, .........she lifted it high into the air......
"
This is the one exception.
 ......The walk-in closet next to the entrance!!"
Bang!!
.........Like a white bolt of lightning striking the earth,
 ......the white piece...
...homed in on a weak spot in Battler\'s territory,
 ......and slammed onto the board......!
"Yes, it is HERE...!!!"
With a crash, the door of the closet, which was just off to the side of the guest room\'s entrance, was impaled by a spear that represented the blue truth.
 Dlanor had spun around and thrown it.
The door was completely pierced,
 ......and the spear stuck in so deeply that if a human had been hiding in it, it would have struck through their chest as well.
 ......Its still quivering handle was a testament to the force with which it had been thrown.
"......................................."
"
There are no places in which to hide other than THIS.
 You are currently hiding in HERE."
".........What do you say, Battler-san...?
 Have you been struck through the heart in a single blow,
 for a literal smothered mate...?"
"................................."
"......Battler-san.
 ......It\'s our move now."
"Yeah.
 ......I thought it would be like that, Erika.
 You intentionally left one spot open so you could stuff me into that coffin.
 ......It\'s the same move that trapped Kinzo in Natsuhi\'s room last game.
 ......I saw this move coming."
"Oh, ......did you?
 ......Then let\'s see your response.
 ......But let me make a prediction."
"Let\'s hear it."
"......In two more moves, I will have you checkmated.
 That\'s my prediction."
"Then I\'ll make the same prediction."
"......I\'ll checkmate you in just two more moves."
"...............Sounds interesting."
"......These predictions contradict each other.
 .........Who will be the liar, I wonder......?"
The air crackled and sparked.
 ......The silence would hurt one\'s skin.
"Then go AHEAD.
 ......It is your TURN."
".........It\'s useless.
 Your lowly coffin won\'t be able to trap Battler-san."
"Here\'s my response."
Slowly,
 ......Battler held his hand over the chess board.
A gold butterfly that had appeared from the darkness rested on Battler\'s finger and became a black piece.
......That black piece was the king, .........which represented Battler himself.
"............You assert...
...that "
Battler is hiding in the closet", ......and this is my response.
 .........Take this."
"
Ushiromiya Battler does not exist within the guest room.
 ......There are no exceptions, including the closet."
Like a black bolt of lightning this time,
 ......Battler slammed his piece down on the white piece of Erika\'s that had cut deep behind his lines, ......smashing that piece completely.
As gold sprayed everywhere and a faint cloud of gold dust hung in the air,
 Erika\'s piece melted beautifully into the darkness......
"......I see, so he hid in the closet at first,
 ......and then slipped out of the room while Erika was occupied by the shower!"
"It\'s the same technique he used to let Kinzo escape from the study in the last game.
 Distract the observation of the observer, and disappear into the darkness."
"......<Good>.
 Of course you\'d say that, of course you would.
 ......I\'d already foreseen that move."
Next was Erika\'s turn.
......A gold butterfly fluttered in front of Erika,
 ......and she grabbed it right out of the air with a swipe of her hand.
She then lifted that hand into the air.........and raised the white piece high.
"Let me announce a retroactive move.
 This occurs back in the very beginning, right after I broke the seals and entered this room.
 ......
At that time, I immediately closed the door, reset the chain, and sealed this room."
"Objection.
Gohda severed the chain back when the crime was first discovered.
 Since the chain lock is not functioning, it is impossible to use it to create a seal."
"Objection overruled.
Erika repaired the chain lock.
 ......See?"
"......That\'s impossible.
 ......How could she have repaired a brass chain?"
"It is possible to repair.
 ......Have you forgotten, Beato?
 The duct tape seals.
 ......
Erika used that duct tape to join the two cut ends of the chain together, "sealing" them.
 In other words, the chain was repaired by the duct tape, and this room once again became a locked room locked from the inside."
"O-objection.
 Erika-san has already used up her duct tape seals, hasn\'t she...?!
 She shouldn\'t be able to use them anymore...!"
"Objection overruled.
The use of the duct tape wasn\'t limited by the number of strips, right?
 It was by the number of rooms.
 ......The only restriction was to limit it to only three rooms.
 ......Erika chose this guest room to be one of those rooms.
 So, Erika has the right to seal as many places as many times as she wants within this room."
".........ng......gah........."
"......That\'s right.
 ......I......gave her permission to do that."
"This is the price you pay for your ARROGANCE.
 .........Pity is the evil liquor that the arrogant most PREFER."
"So,
 with this retroactive move,
I proclaim that the chain lock has been repaired by the duct tape seal and has regained its original functionality.
 And, thanks to that, I locked the room upon entering it and made this guest room a locked room from the inside once more."
The white piece Erika held aloft......represented the seal formed by the chain lock.
This move would draw out Battler\'s king and drag it to the guillotine!
"Die, Battler."
The piece for the chain lock was slammed down on the square of Battler\'s king\'s throat.
"Repetition requested.
 "The lock created by the chain is currently intact"."
"....................................!"
Battler\'s face contorted.
......Beato, who was watching from behind, grimaced even more.
This move......was very painful.
If his logic was that he had hidden in the closet until Erika passed by...
and then used the uproar in the bathroom to escape,
 ......then the chain lock must have been unset.
In other words, he couldn\'t respond to this repetition request.
And if he didn\'t respond, Erika\'s very next move would be to use the blue truth.
She would say, "you hid in the closet, then used the disturbance in the bathroom to escape.
 Since you then couldn\'t set the chain lock from the outside, you left it undone"...
 And she would be right.
......That...would be checkmate.
As Erika had predicted, she would strike the finishing blow on the second move.
.........And on top of that, she would probably use the disappearing Battler...
to fully explain almost all of the tricks behind the crimes that were to follow.
......Losing the battle over this locked room would steal a major deciding piece from Battler...
But what if...
......he was able to respond to the repetition request?
What if he could say "the lock created by the chain is still intact"?
That......would be fatal to Erika.
It had already been shown with the red truth that this guest room could only be made into a locked room from the inside.
So, ......this hopeless locked room would instead become Erika\'s coffin.
With a riddle this tough, Erika would probably be forever unable to solve the mystery of Battler\'s disappearance.
And even a single unsolved riddle would mean victory for the witch side.
Battler......
wanted to respond to this repetition request if at all possible.
However, ......if he responded...
If he answered by saying that the chain was still set...
......he would have to abandon the logic saying that he had escaped while Erika wasn\'t looking.
Because after his escape, he wouldn\'t be able to set the chain lock again.
The new riddle would put Erika in a much more difficult situation, but it would require him to construct a different escape method.
Even a move such as him leaving the closet during the chaos in the bathroom and hiding in another place - say, under the bed - 
wouldn\'t work because he had already proclaimed that "
Battler does not exist within the guest room".
If he could construct logic that allowed him to escape from here while leaving the chain lock intact,
 ............then Erika would be the one facing a fatal blow.
However, ......if he didn\'t have that logic.........if he failed...
......it would be a logic error.
The worst and most abominable illegal move that would instantly end the game in his defeat.
He would have no way to recover.
.........For Battler, ......deciding how to respond to this repetition request...
...was a very advanced and difficult decision......
Either way, ......Erika would probably corner Battler.
"......In that case, .........the choice is obvious."
"B-......Battler-san.
 ......There are already many red truths guaranteeing the locked-room status of this guest room.
 ......How do you plan on escaping from this...?!"
".........If I can just do something about the chain lock......
 ......If I can just do that........."
If I can somehow deceive the chain lock,
 ......I can make Erika have to deal with a terrible locked room!
It will probably finish her off.
But in order to do that, I need to make a trick for escaping this room,
 which remained sealed until Erika returned to it,
 and which was sealed by a chain immediately after Erika entered - 
and on top of that, I have to make sure that the chain that can only be set from the inside remains in place...!
If I can do that...if I can figure out a way...
...then it all ends here...!
But I still can\'t think of that trick...!
Right now, Erika is asking me to repeat whether the chain lock is still set or not.
I need to decide whether I\'ll take that challenge or back down...and I need to do it right now...!
If I have a certain-win trick, then this is where I should fight...!
But if I don\'t have that trick,
 ......I should just acknowledge that I slipped out of the closet, undid the chain, and escaped...and back out of the fight......
If I say the chain was set without a trick up my sleeve,
 .........then it\'s impossible for me to escape.
 In other words, it\'s a logic error......!!
"Even if we lose the fight in this room, there will still be chances left to us.
 We\'ve still only started the second day, haven\'t we?
 We have plenty of time to construct another impossible murder."
"......No, that\'s no good.
 If I admit that I fled from the room, it\'s the same as admitting that I\'m the culprit!
 ......If I back down from the fight in this room, ......it\'s the same as accepting my defeat in this game."
Battler\'s point was a valid one.
If Battler was the only one alive and free to move while all of the other humans were locked in the guesthouse...
 ......Erika would probably name Battler as the perpetrator for all of the following impossible crimes and base her blue truths around that.
If Battler wanted to forcefully turn that around on her,
 he would have to rewrite his tricks and logic so that "someone other than Battler" would be set up as the perpetrator.
To fix up one flaw, he would have to create new flaws,
 ......and the flaws might eventually pile up and kill Battler.
Even running away would mean tightening the noose around his own throat.
The first truth...that Battler is the culprit...has already been hit upon!
But I\'m still going to stubbornly refuse to give in......and somehow......fight to get out of this......! ...I need to fight...!!
This is the make-or-break moment.
 I\'ve definitely been cornered into a dangerous spot.
However, ......if I can nimbly switch gears, everything might turn around at once...
If I can just make this chain my weapon......
I can kill Erika...!!
"Wait, ......are you actually going to respond to her repetition request...?!
 Do you have any logic for how you can escape without undoing the chain lock?!
 .........No, you don\'t!
 If you respond, that\'s it...! ......You\'ll lose instantly from a logic error!
 It\'s clear which choice you ought to make!"
"Yeah, it\'s clear.
 .........No matter what move I choose, it\'ll turn for the worst just as Erika wants.
 ......If it\'s horrible either way,
 ............I\'d like to choose the move that has the biggest reward if we win......!"
".........You\'re going to call, even though you have no logic for escaping and no trump cards?
 ......You\'re planning on accepting her repetition request and taking her on...?!"
"I might not have so much as a single pair in my hand.
 ......But......with just one more card, this hand might become a straight, a flush,
 ......or even a royal straight flush.
 .........If hell waits for me after both options,
 .........I\'ll take the one that\'ll finish her off if I win...!"
"Th-......that\'s an insane move.
 ......Sometimes, when madmen jump into the path of death,
 .........a miracle will occur......"
"It\'s impossible!!
 H-......how are you going to escape this locked room without removing the chain?!!"
"......There\'s only one difference between heroes and madmen.
 ......It\'s whether they win or lose.
 .........If you\'re going to bet big, ......I\'ll be watching with interest......"
If I can finish things with this move, ............then as I predicted,
 ......I can kill Erika on my second move.
I still can\'t think of a trick for escaping this locked room.
However, ......there has to be something......there has to......
And once I think of it, ......I can make a magic illusion of me changing into a butterfly...
and slipping like smoke out of the crack in the chain-locked door...
......If I have even a drop of that mad mage\'s blood in my veins,
 .........if I can have just a shred of the glorious miracle he was able to bring about,
 ......share it with me now......!
"......So, Battler-san?
 Let\'s have that second move that you predicted you would checkmate me on."
"Please provide your answer to Lady ERIKA\'s repetition REQUEST.
 ......Will you RESPOND, ......or will you DECLINE...?!"
Slowly......
...Battler\'s hand.........stretched out to his king piece on the board.
He......lifted it up...
...and slowly...
......held it aloft...
...tracing a large circle in the sky......
Would Battler respond......or wouldn\'t he?
Would the lock caused by the chain be preserved, or wouldn\'t it?
Would Battler\'s king.........crush the piece of the chain lock that stood right in front of it...?
......Or would it slip away like a ghost......and escape......?
"This is.........my response.
 ............As predicted, ......on my second turn...
......you\'re through.
 .........Here it comes,
 ......Furudo...
...Erikaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!"
Battler\'s king became a black lightning bolt and crashed down onto the board...
Where had it gone?!
On top of the piece of the chain lock?
Or past that piece...?
".........I will respond to the repetition request.
The lock caused by the chain is intact."
Battler\'s king...
......had left the chain lock piece in its place...
......and had...
...slipped past it......
"Heh, ......heheheheheheheh......
 ......Yes, it sure would be cool if you could say that the chain lock was still set, wouldn\'t it......?
 That certainly would be cool, I admit......
 ......But do you know what they call someone who\'s so full of himself...
that he jumps into the path of death just because it\'s cool......?"
"............No clue......"
"Ushiromiya...Battler.
 ...
...
...
...
...
 That\'s
 what
 we
 call
 him,
 foooooooooooooooooooooooooooool!
 I file a motion for a logic error!!"
"With that last red truth, you have just cut off your own logic!!
 May the impartial judge issue a judgment on this matter immediately, please!!
 Great Lady LAMBDADELTAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!"
"Motion received.
 ......LAMBDADELTA.
 Does this make logical sense? Your inspection, please."
"Motion received.
 ............Battler.
 .........Show me.
 Let me see......your cards........."
".........Battler......san............"
"......It is a royal...
straight flush, right......?
 If you\'ve got nothing,
 ......you won\'t get out of this with just a "sorry", okay......?"
".....................
 ......Yeah.
 I have no intention of apologizing."
"......If it\'s a logic error, the game board will be blown away.
 ......You inherited this game board from Beato.
 .........It\'s the one memento you possess...
of your precious Beato.
 So you\'ll never be able to accept a logic error."
A logic error only becomes established when the witch admits to it.
As long as they keep thinking about new logic by which they could escape, ......they will not die, cannot die.
However, ......that is like being imprisoned in an endless living hell of the mind.
"......Even if you do manage to crawl around forever after falling into the darkness of thought,
 ......you\'ll just be eternally trapped in a hell where you constantly think of ways to escape the locked room while denying the logic error."
"......Are you sure?! Are you sure?!
 This is the next worst thing to the depths of oblivion, you know?!?!
 It\'s like the difference between falling from the roof of a ten-story building and falling from the roof of a hundred-story building!!"
"............Lambda.
 Battler has already finished making his move.
 Players can\'t take back a move once it\'s made.
 ......Act as the impartial judge you swore to be, carry out our motion,
 and see whether or not Battler\'s escape from the locked room is logical...and whether there has been a logic error or not."
"Be slow, accurate, and meticulous like an archeologist.
 ......And, be as fast as a guy at an ice cream shop when he forcefully and skillfully scoops out that sweet, fragrant vanilla/soy sauce ice cream!!!"
"Y-...yes, I know that.
 .........Battler,
 .........I\'m taking a look now."
".....................Battler-san......"
"Beato, ......do you think......I\'ll lose?"
"......I don\'t want to think that.
 ......You fought with the old me many times...
...and finally reached the miracle that I so wanted you to find.
 ......So, ......I\'d like to believe.........that you\'ll accomplish a miracle...
......once again...!"
".........The woman called BEATRICE...
 ...She fought on that same border between reason and madness...
......the whole time.
 ......She fought with a mixture of anger, sadness, and several other emotions towards me that can\'t be described with words.
 .........And in the very last game,
 ......at the very last moment,
 .........she managed...
......to seize victory."
That might have been......the rank of the hand in Beato\'s grip as she fell.
Beato passed away...
...without realizing...
...that she had already won.
In that final game,
 ......the true victor.........
was Beato......
"She entrusted me with this game board.
 ......That\'s why...I\'m going to win.
 .........So, I need you alone to believe in me.
 ......BEATRICE..."
"If believing......will bring about a miracle..."
"........................Please."
"I\'ll believe in you......!!
 Battler-san...!!!"
"Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaahh, this is pissing me ooooooooooooff!!!
 Please just check it already, Lady LAMBDADELTA!!
 There is no valid logic!
 There doesn\'t exist any way to get out of this locked room!!
 You were overeager, Battler-san!
 Sure, if you could win with this, that\'d be cool!"
"If you managed to disappear even though the chain was still set, that\'d be amaaaazing! So cooool! How mysterious! Hold me!
 Squeeeeeeeeeeeeeee! Aaahhahhaaaaaaaaahhh!!
 Like hell you caaaaaaaaaaaaan!!
 Like hell you can do that!!
 If you could do that, you really would be a witch!
 If you could vanish your way out of this locked room like a puff of smoke, I\'d have to acknowledge it!
 It\'d be the work of a wiiiiiiiitch!!!"
"Quiet, Lady ERIKA!
 ......Lady LAMBDADELTA is conducting her INSPECTION."
".................................
 ...............Pass through, one move.
 ...Go back,
 ......corner."
With sweat gathering on her forehead, ......LAMBDADELTA inspected the movements of the pieces from Battler\'s side.
She was as accurate and meticulous as an archeologist, ......just as BERNKASTEL had told her to be.
"................................."
After gulping stiffly,
 ......Lambda looked between the formation of the pieces on the board...
...and Battler\'s face,
which remained tense but steady.
"......Lambda.........?"
".........I have...
......finished my inspection......"
"There\'s no way the logic works......!"
"...............Please......God......"
"..........................."
".........Erika."
"What...?"
"I\'m very sorry."
"Wh-.........which way am I supposed to take that...?!!"
"It was fun.
 ......Now, this is the end."
"For hell\'s sake, ......which way am I supposed to take thaaaaaaaaaaaaaat?!!"
"Silence!!
 I have finished inspecting Battler\'s move.
 .........The verdict is - "
"......Valid."
"Va......lid.........?"
"......You lie...!!"
"I judge it to be valid.
 ......He\'s presented logic that doesn\'t violate any of the red truths, and I\'ve finished checking it.
 ......The move by the player on the witch side, and the red truth given in response to the final repetition request, is valid.
 .........Battler.
 For the first time, ......I have to say I think you\'re incredible..."
".........See?
 ......In your game, ......a miracle will always occur if you believe."
"B-.........Battler...san......!!
 I...I\'m sorry...!!
 If only I had believed more strongly, ......you wouldn\'t have been cornered like this......!! Waaaaaaaahh!!"
Beato flew onto Battler\'s chest, sobbing...
Erika staggered backwards, ......shaking her head back and forth dizzily.
And BERNKASTEL...?
............Her face was like an expressionless mask.
Then, ......slowly...
......it became a smile...
And for some reason,
 ......it seemed the sign of some horrible emotion......
"Well......DONE......
 ......To think...
...that you escaped the room...
...without removing the chain...
 ......Simply SPLENDID......"
With her small hands, .........Dlanor slowly started to applaud quietly.
......She was followed by Gertrude, and then Cornelia.
......And then by Beato and LAMBDADELTA too.
.........Applause......filled the room.........
"O-......Onii-chan......
 ......H-......how did you........."
"......I see.
 ......Yes, a move that cannot be seen by one whose thoughts are trapped within the locked room..."
"Impossible,
 ......im...
...possible......
 ......Eee...
eeeeeeeeeeek.........!"
As LAMBDADELTA watched Erika, who was stunned and moaning in shock from despair she couldn\'t accept,
 ...she had to take her hat off to the strength of Battler\'s heart and intelligence at this critical moment...
...and to the power of his miracles.
......Incredible, ......Ushiromiya Battler.
I was so wrong to think that your power and Beato\'s would cancel each other out and bring an eternal draw...... I\'ve suffered total defeat.
 .........And Bern, who realized your true strength,
 but thought she could get you to do what she wanted...
...well, she\'s suffered total defeat too.
Bern is the witch who waits for miracles.
You are the witch who summons miracles.
.........You...
...are not Bern\'s piece.
......In this moment,
 ......without a doubt,
 ......you have surpassed Bern......
......The fact that you only took a moment to think up a trick to escape this locked room...
......really is...
......nothing short of stunning......!
As Erika predicted, ......Battler had been hiding in the closet.
Then, during the chaos in the bathroom, he had snuck out of the door.
 ......Erika had guessed this much.
She retroactively set the chain lock and sealed it to prevent Battler from doing this very thing.
The chain lock cannot be reset from the outside.
So, it should have been impossible to escape from the locked room.
However, ......by thinking outside of the locked room, ......Battler broke through.
......We can use anyone to explain it, ......but let\'s go with the piece of Kyrie, his mother.
Just like Battler,
 the other victims of the first twilight have not been confirmed dead with the red truth.
In other words, ......just like Battler,
 ......the others - including Kyrie - can still move.
And their locked rooms are not sealed, so they can go out as they please.
......Kyrie......came to save him.
Kyrie followed behind Erika, ......and waited in the hallway while the latter entered the guest room and sealed the door from the inside.
......Then, after Battler undid the chain lock and escaped,
 .........she entered the room in his place......
Then, ......Kyrie reset the chain lock from the inside,
 ......and hid in the closet, ......just like Battler had done......
Yes.
 ......It is true that Battler isn\'t inside this guest room right now.
However, that doesn\'t mean that no one else is inside it.
......Kyrie took Battler\'s place in the closet,
 .........the one exception that Erika left unchecked, and is there still......
Kyrie...
......saved......Battler............
Ushiromiya Kyrie
 CANNOT SAVE Battler
.
............Huh.........?
"Wh-......what do you mean......?"
"......
Ushiromiya Kyrie......cannot save Battler."
"...Wh-......why not?!
 There\'s no red saying that Kyrie can\'t save Battler!
 Wait a second, ......how are you using the red truth?!"
"It\'s valid.
 .........Dlanor\'s red truth is valid."
"Applying for authorization to unsheathe the Red KEY."
".........Granted.
 Dlanor, do it, please."
"H-............how......?
 ......How...can you authorize that?!?!"
"It\'s valid.
 ......I guarantee this red truth by impartial judgment."
".........Without telling us your reason?!"
"We\'ll reveal that soon.
 ......Very soon."
"...B-......Battler hasn\'t proclaimed Kyrie dead with the red truth yet...!
 It\'s allowed for Kyrie to be playing dead!
 And the duct tape has already been used on three rooms, making it impossible for you to seal Kyrie\'s room...!"
"So how can you use the red truth to say that Kyrie can\'t save Battler?!
 That red truth has no basis!!"
"We\'ll tell you its basis soon.
 ......But more importantly, Lambda......?
 ......The logic with Kyrie has ceased to function.
 ......You should probably find another piece to switch places with Battler, don\'t you think...?"
"...........................nn,
 ......y-
...yes.
 ......There are still pieces that can save Battler."
Reconstruct the logic.
......All we need is someone who can switch places with Battler - it doesn\'t have to be Kyrie.
"Then let\'s switch it to Natsuhi.
 ......Ushiromiya Natsuhi switched places with Battler...!"
"Dlanor. ......Do it."
"As you WISH."
Dlanor\'s red longsword......smashed Natsuhi\'s piece into little bits...
How...?!
How...
...can Erika deny this logic...
...without the detective\'s authority?!
"
Ushiromiya Natsuhi cannot save Battler."
"Th-then Eva!
 Ushiromiya Eva!!"
"
Ushiromiya Eva cannot save Battler."
"Then Rosa!
 Maria!!"
"
Save your brEATH.
 Neither Rosa nor Maria can come to his aiD.
 ......DEATH-DEATH-DEATH-DEATH-
DEATH-DEATH-DEATH-DEATH!
 <Die the DEATH>!
 <Sentence to DEATH>!
 <Great equalizer is the DEATH>!!"
"O-objection!
 Erika-san doesn\'t have the detective\'s authority!
 ......How can she use any red except for the duct tape seals...?!"
"Objection overruled.
 ......The lack of the detective\'s authority does not imply that no red truth can be used whatsoever.
 ............There is a way.
 ......Isn\'t there?"
"Yes, ......there is.
 There are......a few exceptional red truths......that even Humans without the detective\'s authority can use."
"......That\'s crazy...
 ......There\'s no way something like that exists!"
"Yes, such a thing cannot EXIST.
 ......However, ......there is a certain action permissible only to Humans without the detective\'s authority,
 ......and it can become a truth of such overwhelming credibility...
......that witches can easily raise it to the level of red TRUTH."
"A certain action permissible only to Humans who...
...aren\'t the detective.........?"
".....................Y-......you don\'t mean...
 ......Erika......you didn\'t......"
"......I...I\'ve got it.
 ......Yes, ...if I\'m right,
 ......these red truths are valid..."
"I...I don\'t understand!
 Was there some power that could only be used without the detective\'s authority...?!"
".........There is.
 ......There is just one."
"So, you\'ve finally realized.
 ......That\'s right.
 ......And it was for that reason, and that reason alone, ......that I abandoned the detective\'s authority this time around.
 ......You told me I could make the detective proclamation whenever I wanted, right?
 .........Well, unfortunately,
 ...I am no longer capable of making that proclamation."
"Knox\'s...
......which one was it......"
"
Knox\'s 7th.
 .........It is forbidden for the detective to be...
the CULPRIT."
"B-but that\'s...
......wh-.........whaaat?!"
......Finally, Beato realized everything.
Yes, ......the detective\'s authority bestows several powers that are useful for reasoning,
 but it eliminates one single privilege.
That is Knox\'s seventh commandment.
......It is forbidden for the detective to be the culprit...
"......In this game,
 ......it is impossible for Humans without the detective\'s authority to examine corpses perfectly."
"......So, ......there have been several tricks where the dead have all been faking and walking around where they please.
 ......You probably thought you could use that logic to create several impossible crimes after this."
"......When I said that I wouldn\'t make the detective proclamation,
 somewhere on the inside, you must have said "I\'ve won"."
".........You\'re pretty sly yourself.
 You gave me the duct tape seals, seemingly out of mercy, but that was because you planned to have all of the first twilight victims survive,
 band together, and carry out the crimes.
 That\'s why you gave me only three rooms\' worth, which wouldn\'t cover all six people."
"No matter which rooms I sealed, at least one of your pawns could move freely.
 .........You must have been plotting to use that to corner me.
 ......But too bad.
 Your naivety is deeply tiresome.
 ......You stupid man!"
"..................I admit it.
 ......I admit that I fell for your monkey show...
and that in my pride, I tried to show you some mercy.
 .........That\'s right.
 ......Even without the detective\'s authority, ......there is a way.
 ......A way for a Human to make sure that a corpse examination cannot fail."
Is the human lying in front of you alive or dead?
You can answer that question by examining the corpse.
With just a quick glance, your chances of being right are fifty-fifty either way.
Various bits of knowledge and experience can be used to obtain a more precise result.
.........However, no matter how much you do that,
 while you can reach up to 99%, you can never reach 100% accuracy.
......That\'s what most people would think.
However, there is one way.
......One way to conduct a perfect examination.
"Kill them.
 .........It\'s as simple as that."
".........Erikaa...aa......"
"Without the detective\'s authority, I can\'t tell whether the victims are dead or faking.
 So, I needed a way to be sure.
 ......And, if possible,
 it would be preferable if they were removed from the game board,
 so that they couldn\'t make a mess of things later on."
"So, I dashed all over the mansion,
 visited all the crime scenes,
 and............
I killed everyone all over again!"
"Wh-......what on.........earth..............."
".........Of course, she couldn\'t just kill them however she liked.
 ......It had to be a perfect way of killing, good enough that their deaths could be determined with the red truth.
 ......Erika made sure of that."
"The manner in which they were each killed differed,
 .........but afterwards,
she completely severed the heads of all those she killed.
 ......That method of killing is solid enough to be called a red truth, right...? Lambda......?"
"......I-...............it\'s valid.
 No human could survive...
......after being decapitated...!"
"C-could you have severed all of those heads without getting any blood on you?!"
"For example, you can take a large trash bag from the kitchen and grab the knife through it.
 ......Then, if you cover the entire corpse with the trash bag as you do your work, you can block nearly all of the blood spatter."
Naturally, I prepared a separate knife and bag for each person I killed, and left those items at the crime scene.
Of course, I didn\'t humiliate myself by walking around with them, leaving blood in the hallways and dirtying my clothes.
There will probably be trash bags left at the crime scene with my fingerprints on them,
 but since the game ends before the police come, and the bags won\'t be used as evidence of anything,
 they can just be left there without a problem.
"......Are you insane?
 ......What kind of...
mystery would...
ever allow something like that......?"
"I can\'t believe I\'m hearing that from a witch on the fantasy side.
 Oh, and don\'t worry.
 I didn\'t kill you.
 ......I found you last and didn\'t have time to sever your head,
 so I just sealed your whole room with the duct tape you gave me."
"......Then again, that might\'ve been because I knew this would happen and wanted to watch you flounder.
 .........*giggle*,
 ......*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*!
 Oh, that\'s right.
 ......Just like I can say that I killed them in red, I can say one more thing."
At that point, Erika stopped for a second,
 ......and still,
 ...aaah, is she really capable of an expression even uglier than all the ones before......?
With that...
...greatest of all faces, ......she spoke.
"
All five people I killed......were very much alive until the moment I killed them.
 ......Everyone faithfully played dead as best they could until the moment just before I killed them, okay?"
".........Maria-san was quite the little trouper.
 .........After all, even though her mother had already been killed in the same room,
 .........she kept on playing dead without even noticing......
 *giggle*, *giggle*giggle* - "
"Hahahahaha,
 ahhahahahahahahahahaha...
hehahyahhahahahaahahaaahaaaah!!"
They\'re devils...
Up to now,
 ......many witches and demons have appeared in this tale,
 ......but this is the first time...
...I\'ve seen...
...a true devil......
"You bastards......
 ......You bastards......
 ...Uu......uugyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!!!"
At last, Beato understood the entire plot of this tale.
This tale......was just the story of a prank.
Someone must have come up with the idea of playing a slightly harsh trick on their inconsiderate guest,
 who loved to show off her intelligence and act the part of a great detective,
 ......and several people had agreed to go along with it.
The ones who would play the victims went into their assigned rooms, set the chain and the lock from the inside,
 ......and played dead......to create a fake locked-room murder......
......If you think about it that way, the rooms chosen for the corpses seem to make more sense.
It was only natural for Natsuhi to "die" in her own room.
......If you\'re going to play dead, it\'s only natural that you\'d want to lie down on your own bed.
Eva\'s vanity is strong, so she must have volunteered to "die" in the VIP room.
Kyrie was in Krauss\'s study.
......That was probably well air-conditioned and comfortable.
Rosa and Maria were in the parlor.
A soft sofa would have been a great place to play dead.
......Maria had gone the extra mile to make it look more realistic by lying dead alongside the wall.
Battler was in a guest room.
 The temperature here was also nice.
The bed must also have been fairly pleasant.
...Yes.
 The victims for this first twilight had all died in comfortable rooms.
In the past games, the corpses had often been found exposed in the courtyard or under the rose garden arbor.
In the cold gardening shed or in the boiler room......
This time, there were no victims in any such inhospitable environments.
This...
...is probably the truth.
This was the story of a prank, where no one was dead in the first place...
And then...
......this......devil...
............turned it into a genuine murder case......!
"......You do have the right to speak ill of Lady ERIKA.
 ......However, ......at this moment, you have the obligation to present new logic that does not lead to any CONTRADICTIONS."
"Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.
 Corpses to corpses...!
 So, Battler-san? Let\'s continue the game!!
 Please present a different human to switch places with you.
 If you don\'t, your trick.........will become a logic error......"
There\'s now......no one who can come to the rescue.
Erika\'s killed every last one of them!!
"D-......dammit......dammit, dammit, dammiiiiiiiiit!!"
"......Battler-san, please, calm yourself...!
 Now\'s the time to wipe our tears away and fight...!
 Even if you\'ve lost five pieces who can save you, there\'s still eleven in the guesthouse!"
"Y-you\'re right...
 ......Krauss, Hideyoshi, Rudolf, ......George, Jessica, Shannon, Kanon!
 Genji, Gohda, Kumasawa, Nanjo!!
 It doesn\'t matter who, as long as someone comes here!!
 Somebody, somebody, heeeeeeeeelp!!"
"But there\'s no waaaaaayyyyyywehwehhwehhwwehwwehweehhh!!
 Take a look at thiiiiiiiiiis!
 Gertruuuude,
 Corneliaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!"
""For your attention: we beg to inform you that we are here and ready.""
"Bwaattleeer-swaaaaaann!!
 You gotta seeeeeeeeeee thiiiis!!
 Whaaaaaat\'sssss the deeeeeeal?!"
Erika, who was now so excited that her pronunciation was tumbling all over the place,
 pointed at two doors.
It was the hallway on the second floor of the guesthouse...
......They were in front of the cousins\' room and the next room over.
"Look, here, here!
 There\'s something stuck to the dooooooor!!
 Whuzzis?! Whuzzis?!
 Hey, do you know, Gertroooooooood?!"
"......For your attention: know that it is the duct tape seal of the cousins\' room."
"<OH YEAAAAHHH>!!
 <VERY GOOOOOD>!!
 <One more>!!
 Wuzzabout the thing on THIS doorrrrrrrrrrrr?!?!"
"Be advised that it is the duct tape seal of the next room over."
"<Oh, very GOOD>!!
 Okay, you two!
 And all of you watching at home on your TVs!!
 Pleease have a look at the duct tape seals on both doors!!
 So, what do you think of them...?!
 Are they broken? Are they not broken...?
 Please, the red truth, loudly so we all can hear!!"
""
For your attention: I beg to inform you of the following.
 Know that neither is broken.""
"
Know that an unbroken seal is proof that all have hitherto been denied passage."
"
It needs no second telling, but be advised that passing through without breaking the seal is impossible!!"
"GOOD.
 ...Battler, it is as you SEE.
 ......There no longer exists anyone who can come to your AID."
The victims of the first twilight have all been killed!
And the guesthouse is still sealed!!
No one can come to the rescue...!!
"Uug......
kh...
...gghh.........!"
Erika had anticipated this moment all that time ago,
 ......and that was why she had made the strategic move of suddenly sealing these two rooms.
This resolved the confusion Cornelia had felt back then.
Why wouldn\'t the human side player want as many free humans as possible?
 That was a natural, simple question to ask.
However, once you seal up all of the humans,
 ......there is no room for magic to intervene.
Why is magic magic?
Because the people who saw it say that it was magic.
Then, is it possible for magic to exist in a place with no people?
......There\'s no problem with that because there\'s no anti-magic toxin, right...?
Wrong!
 Magic in a place that isn\'t being witnessed is no different from a delusion, a daydream!
Magic with results must be carried out by human hands.
If all humans are sealed off, then magic cannot be created.
This was Erika\'s strategy for this game......and her beautiful...checkmate!!
"Well now.
 ......Who\'s going to come save you?
 Please tell me who the "real" person is who switched places with you, remained in the guest room in your place,
 and set the chain lock from the inside.
 ......If they even exist."
".........Well, Battler...?
 You have a broken thread of logic.
 ......Who could have come to save you?
 You are currently in the middle of a logic error."
"Uugh...
......w-
......wait...
 I\'m still......thinking......!"
"......Battler, you have two rights and one obligation.
 ......Your first right is the right to build a new thread of logic to reconstruct your locked-room trick.
 Your second right is the right to come clean and admit to your logic error.
 And your one obligation...is to choose one of those two options."
"There is some mercy.
 There\'s no restriction on the amount of time you have to make that choice.
 .........*giggle*, that\'s right, your time is endless, eternal."
"I...I\'m sure there\'s still some way,
 .........some twisted logic or loophole or...
...anyway, ......I\'m sure there\'s still some way......!"
"I\'m thinking about it!
 What about you, Beato?!
 ......Let me know if you find anything...
 .........I\'m sure the old Beato......could have managed something...
 She built up several locked rooms like this...!!"
Beato felt awful...
......Why was she Beato, and yet not?!
Surely, the old her would have thought up a trick under these restrictions.
If only she could do that, she could guide Battler to victory......but she couldn\'t do it as her current self!
"*giggle*.
 Yes, I\'m sure you\'ll think of a good trick.
 Eventually, surely, probably, maybe.
 ......Pretty sure it\'s impossible though.
 *giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*!!"
"......So then, Battler.
 ......Let\'s go back to the guest room.
 From now on, that will be your world."
Once again, ......they returned to the slightly chilly guest room.
It was the same room as before, of course,
 ......but it felt as though an unsettling darkness had crept in...
"Here\'s the room you\'ll spend your days in from now on.
 .........You just need to escape from this room by any means you want."
"......However, there are conditions.
 ......As I believe you know, these are all things you forced on yourself."
"......First,
this room is a locked room created from the inside.
 The seals on the windows are intact, so there can be no escape from there.
 Of course, there is no way to escape by leaving through the bathroom."
"
......I\'ll make it simple.
 There is no exit to escape from except for this door.
 However, the chain lock on this door is set.
 You can unset and reset it all you want, but you can only do so from the inside.
 Furthermore, you are free to go out through the door, but leaving while the chain lock remains unset will not count as an escape.
 You have to show that you can escape from this room with the chain lock still connected......!!"
"......But...
...he couldn\'t possibly......"
"He couldn\'t possibly do it?
 He made this locked room himself...!!"
"We have set up...just one exit other than the door.
 ......That one\'s in the bathroom."
"My merciful master has arranged for a last way out if you fail to think of any trick to escape.
 ......Please listen up!!"
BERNKASTEL guided Battler to the bathroom.
It was just a normal bathroom.
The setup intended to surprise Erika and buy Battler time was no longer working.
However, the bundle of wire and the nippers that had been used to prepare that trap...
still lay in the empty bathtub.
"Are you saying......that I can use these to help me escape.........?"
"Yes, please feel free.
 It\'s a present.
......However, no matter what you use, you can\'t lock the room from the outside.
 And you can\'t fool the seals either, okay?
 These tools aren\'t here to help you pull some trick with the chain lock.
 ......They\'re here to let you escape from this room in a more direct way..."
"......H-......how am I supposed to use these......?"
"........................
 ......Not bad, Bern.
 ......I see......that your mind\'s as grotesque as ever........."
"There is an exit that leads directly outside from this bathroom.
 ......Can you find it?"
"......Y-......you don\'t mean............"
"D-did you figure it out, Beato...?!
 Please, tell me...!!"
"That\'s...
.........i-
......impossible........."
"Please, where is it?! Tell me!!
 We can\'t let the game end like this!!"
"There......"
"Huh? Where......?
 Under...the bathtub......?"
"Can\'t you see it? There\'s a round hole that leads straight out of this room."
"......It\'s a bit small though......"
"Y-
......you...
......you...
......aahh...
...nngggyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh......"
"It\'s the drain right there at the bottom of the bathtub.
 You can get out through there without touching the chain lock.
 But your body is a bit too big to get through this exit.
 ......That\'s why I decided to lend you those tools there."
Escape......through the drain...?
 How...?
She couldn\'t mean using those nippers for a hundred years to widen that hole, right...?
Battler and Beato......had already realized.
......They had figured out this demonic way out that the demons were proposing......
"Just use those nippers...
...and cut your body into pieces that can fit."
"......Pinch, rip, snip.
 ......You can sit back in the tub under a hot shower...
...and start from your toes...snip then wash, snip then wash...
 Just keep doing that and, oh, what do you know,
 you\'ve suddenly managed to escape from the locked room."
"\'Oh, what do you know\' is right, my master...!
 It looks like both siblings are going to end up the same way...!
 Heheh......heheheheheheheheheeheheheh!!"
"But Bern...?
 If he does it that way, the hand holding the nippers will be left at the end."
"That\'s why we have the wire...
 ...Beforehand, Battler will have to wrap the wire around his wrist, then stretch the other end out into the corridor through the crack in the door.
 ......You should be able to fit just a wrist through the crack left by the chain lock."
"......If you can make yourself that small, I\'d be happy to pull that wire from the hallway and save you."
"My master, if you do that, I want it!!
 Battler\'s wrist...
eheheheheheheheheeheheheheheheh!!"
"And what would you use that for...?
 But no, I\'ve already decided to use it as a back scratcher.
 When the time comes, I\'ll scratch your back with it. What do you say?"
"Y-yeees, my master...
 ...Master\'s going to scratch my back...
with Battler\'s handhahahaaaaaaaaaaahaaaaaaaaaahhh!!"
"........Finding them annoying?
 Irritating? Obnoxious?
 ......Don\'t worry, it\'ll get quiet really soon.
 ......Until you can escape from this room, all noise to disturb your thoughts...
......will disappear for all eternity."
"Th-...that\'s a relief...
 I\'ll be glad of the quiet...!"
"..................Here\'s......some advice from a survivor of hell.
 ......Enjoy the liveliness while you can.
 .........Even the annoying insults you hear now...
......will be useful as fond memories to preserve your sanity in the depths of eternal silence."
.........Do you hate Bern and Erika?
Then that\'s their parting gift to you.
.........As long as you have hatred, you will be able to avoid giving up.
Giving up has a completely different meaning here, okay...?
.........Once you give up, still can\'t escape, and realize that hell is eternal,
 ......you\'ll wish you prepared yourself earlier.
"Did you just call yourself a survivor......?
 ......Then,
 .........you also......"
"......You know, ............every once in a while,
 ...that terror comes back to me.
 .........I wonder......whether I really have escaped from that hell.
 .........What if......I actually lost my mind a long time ago...
......and I\'m still in there...
......just having delusions about being here and chatting happily with you all like this...?
 .........That nightmare still terrifies me..."
".........And so, I need to constantly feel...truly feel that this isn\'t a dream...
 ......Hey, ......are you guys......really.........real......?
 ...You aren\'t just an insane delusion I\'m having inside that hell, ......right......? Right? .........Right......?"
There was something in LAMBDADELTA\'s pleading expression that sent shivers down the spine.
It was probably more terrifying than any threatening words she could have used with even the most vile expression on her face......
It was time for Battler to realize.
......A logic error isn\'t so sympathetic that you can just stick out your tongue,
 ask for forgiveness, and say you\'ll be more careful next time......
Even if you feel that the fight is at a point where you can\'t back down, risking a logic error by leaving things up to chance......is never......a risk you should take.
It was time for him to pay up and understand the true risk and terror implied by the words "betting one\'s life on a fight",
 which must sound so exciting for a man......
"Battler-san, hang on in there...!
 I\'ll think deeply upon it as well!
 I\'ll devote everything I have to thinking of a trick to escape this room...!
 I will come to save you...!!"
"B-......Beato......
 ...Uuu......uuuaaaarrggggghhhh......
 I\'ll definitely think of something... Just you waaaaaaatch......"
"Well, regretfully, it\'s time for us to leave.
 We mustn\'t get in the way of his job any longer."
"See you later,
 Battler-san.
 ......Or, like you\'d say it, <see you again>, right?
 <Have a nice day>...
*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*!"
".........Later,
 ......Battler.
 ......Good luck."
"Battler-san, don\'t give up...!
 You\'ll definitely think of a trick!
 I\'ll think as well, and I\'ll come to save you!!"
"B-......Beato............?!"
Before he could finish saying Beato\'s name, ......they had all disappeared.
......They hadn\'t disappeared in a golden spray, or turned into butterflies and flown away...
As if there had never been anyone but him in this room to begin with,
 ......Battler blinked once,
 .........and everyone else was gone.
Nothing remained - 
not their voices, their presence, their warmth,
 ......nor even the faint perfume Beato had worn.
The frigid air of the room was wrapped only in the lonely sound of the wind and rain......
With that overpowering feeling of isolation......
I finally began to realize.........how horrible a punishment......this would be......
"D-......damn those bastards...
 ......It can\'t be that hard to get out of a room like this......
 I mean, rooms are made so that people can come in and out of them, right...?
 ......If they can\'t do that, you wouldn\'t call it a room."
This is stupid...
 ......It\'s easy to undo a lock and chain from the inside.
......Dammit...
 ......For some reason, I\'ve always been clumsy,
 ......and undoing chain locks always gives me trouble.
Aha, ......it\'s off.
 Heheh, ......heh......what a stupid puzzle.
Look, ......now the door opens freely, ......see...
......Hey...
...what\'s this cold feeling on my neck......?
What the hell is this.........?
......Why is there suddenly this iron collar around my neck......that\'s attached to a chain?
Dammit, who would do something like that...
......Wh-when I reset the chain lock, it disappears.
 And when I undo it, it comes back.
The chain is pretty long, so I can make it a little way out into the hallway.
But I can\'t go far from the door...
Then if I close the door,
 .........stand on the outside and stick my hand through the crack...
......and just somehow set that chain......
 .........Uuu......geh......
Why......have I always been so clumsy...
 .........I\'m not really clumsy, ......it\'s just that me and chain locks don\'t go well together...
 Dammit, ......I hate chain locks, ...I hate chains......
 Why......won\'t it work......?
 Why......can\'t I set the chain lock from the outside......?
 Dammit...dammit...dammit...
 ......Nng...
...ggyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh...!!!
"......Battler-san,
 ......Battler-san!!
 Hang in there, hang in there...!!"
"...........................
 ......Can\'t......get out...
.........ggh......kk........."
Beato called out to Battler repeatedly, shaking his shoulders hard, ......but by now, Battler\'s eyes were blank.
......The words didn\'t reach him......
BERNKASTEL and Erika had already left.
The game was officially suspended until Battler could think of a new trick,
 ......but it was doubtful that it would be resumed even after a thousand years...or more...
".........Okay, I\'m heading off too.
 ......So long, you two."
"Th-there\'s no need to say "so long"...!
 We\'ll - We\'ll think of a trick in no time, and the game will resume!
 We won\'t take up your time...!
 So stay here a little longer...! Please...!!"
"......We\'ve drawn those same words out of many a witch\'s mouth in the past.
 ......And I\'ve heard of hardly any who\'ve actually managed to resume their games.
 ......As far as I know, the only two are me......and Bern."
"Why......why would a person who knows about that hell throw another person into it?!
 Just because you\'re bored?
 Is that all?!"
"...............Yeah, that\'s all.
 ......It\'s to escape from boredom.
 ......Because when we get bored, ......we remember.
 We remember that hell.
 .........And, you know,
 ......by throwing someone else down into that hell,
 ......we realize that, oh, we\'re the ones on the throwing side,
 ......and that means we aren\'t in that hell ourselves.
 .........If we don\'t keep doing that,
 .........then the fear of that hell will overwhelm us..."
"......If you two managed to get out of it, then he can as well!
 I will save him...!! For certain......!!!"
"For certain......?
 ......You stand before the Witch of Certainty, LAMBDADELTA,
 and swear a certain outcome...?"
"Yes! For certain...!!"
".................................
 ......Very well.
 I was the guardian for the former you anyway.
 ......Though the current you is different,
 ......I\'ll do you one last favor.
 ......I\'ll give you a parting gift."
"And what......is that...?"
"Hope.
 .........The hope that as long as you hold on to your "certainty", your wish will definitely come true."
"........................"
"Listen.
 The old you was the Endless Witch BEATRICE.
 ......You used to love detective novels that depicted impossible crimes,
 and you used those to make the claim that a witch existed, to make many people believe in magic...
as one stage on your path to becoming a witch."
"......Detective......novels..."
"Yep.
 The old you was an avid reader.
 ......A lover of detective novels and locked-room murders......and a super expert on impossible crimes.
 After devouring book after book and reading through countless locked-room tricks,
 ......you hit upon the ultimate, single, origin trick, and you used it to form the core of your system of magic."
"......Battler told you, right?
 ......He told you that the old you would definitely have thought of a way out of this predicament.
 .........I\'ll acknowledge that.
 I guarantee it by the name of the Witch of Certainty, LAMBDADELTA.
 ......The old you would definitely have solved this locked room trick......!"
"........................!"
"......That\'s my parting gift to you.
 ............Goodbye.
 You\'ve sworn certainty to the Witch of Certainty.
 So I won\'t say farewell.
 .........\'I\'ll see you again soon\'."
"Y-......yes.
 .........We\'ll see you again...soon......!"
LAMBDADELTA vanished into thin air......
And left behind in the witch\'s tea room...
 ...were the two who had held the title of Endless Witch.
One had empty eyes.
 The other supported the first by his side.
......Ironically, ......it was the exact opposite...
...of how their relationship had been in the previous game......
