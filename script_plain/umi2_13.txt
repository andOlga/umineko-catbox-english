With Jessica\'s death, it became certain that the culprit was hiding somewhere nearby, and that they would come after our lives if they had a chance.
According to Genji‐san, when tomorrow morning comes, the boat should arrive.
The boat has a radio, too.
We\'ll probably be able to contact the police immediately with that.
We all gathered in the parlor, and decided to wait quietly until tomorrow.
I proposed that we should search throughout the mansion for clues about the culprit,
 but Auntie Rosa rejected that, saying that if we put pressure on the culprit, or provoked them,
 it might lead to a third murder.
...That was probably the right thing to do.
Even if a bunch of amateurs like us investigated, there\'s no way we\'d find anything.
It would be wisest to focus on protecting ourselves without doing anything unnecessary, and leave it to the police after tomorrow.
We had been tense in the beginning, but other than Auntie Rosa,
 most of us had spent all morning watching TV and were getting bored, so our sense of danger had grown much less intense.
When we thought about it, even though there certainly had been six adults killed at once in the first murder,
 that made us imagine that some back‐handed method like poison had been used.
And in the second murder, it was thought that those two had become sacrifices because they were unfortunately isolated from the rest of us.
From this, we imagined that there weren\'t a great number of culprits,
 and they didn\'t have the ability to kill this large group gathered in the parlor all at once.
Right now, in this parlor, there was George‐aniki and me,
 Maria,
 Auntie Rosa,
 Genji‐san, Gohda‐san, Shannon‐san, Kumasawa‐san, ......and finally Doctor Nanjo—a total of nine people were here.
Furthermore, Auntie Rosa was even armed with a gun.
Surely, with this many people staying in this room, they wouldn\'t be able to touch us easily.
That feeling of security, along with the passage of time, allowed us to recover from the shock of that morning bit by bit...
Incidentally, lunchtime had just ended for us.
However, it had been a canned‐food lunch, a far cry from last night\'s dinner which Gohda‐san had skillfully made for us.
...Auntie Rosa too had suspected that poison had been used in the murder of those six people.
...So, we probably couldn\'t deny the possibility that the culprit had snuck into the kitchen during all that confusion in the morning, and mixed poison in with the ingredients there.
......Auntie Rosa had ordered all of us not to put anything into our mouths except safe foods like canned food, until the police came.
As a cook, Gohda‐san must have felt very let down.
As though he wanted to display his skill anyway, he said that he at least wanted to bring the plates and pile them up with canned food.
At first, Auntie Rosa had been reluctant, examining each one of the plates that were brought, but she hadn\'t been able to find anything to complain about,
 and Gohda‐san\'s "Chef\'s Pick Canned Food Combo Lunch" had become a reality.
Gohda‐san had said something about taste being savored not just with the tongue, but with the eyes too.
...I found myself agreeing—it had been the same canned food we ate for breakfast, but it felt like something completely different...
"Uu, Battler.
 Look, look.
 Here, "Wolves and Sheep Puzzle".
 Uu."
As I was sitting lazily on a sofa, with no desire to watch TV,
 Maria came over, pulled a picture book out of her handbag, and held it out to me as she said that.
"......What is that book?
 "Wolves and Sheep Puzzle"?
 ..................Let\'s have a look‐see."
"Wolves and Sheep Puzzle".
It was a phrase that Auntie Rosa had said this morning when we had gone to call on Jessica.
...At the time, I hadn\'t known what it meant, and then after that, there was the uproar when Jessica\'s body was found, so I\'d forgotten about it completely.
The book that Maria held out to me looked like a foreign picture book or something that had been translated.
Opening it, I could tell that the book contained an assortment of puzzles.
"Uu.
 So there\'s several wolves and sheep, okay?
 And the puzzle is to take them to the other side using one boat."
"......Hmmmm?
 I\'ve heard of a game with rules like this.
 So this is that, but with wolves and sheep?"
It was a very simple puzzle, passed on from long ago.
Let\'s try one of the problems.
On the right bank, there are two wolves and two sheep.
There is a boat that as many as two animals can ride on, and using it, you have to move all four of them to the opposite left bank.
There are two rules.
The first is regarding the boat.
It can be paddled by wolves or sheep, and even just by one animal on its own.
But it can only hold up to two.
The second is regarding the wolves.
When they are greater in number than the sheep in that location, they attack the sheep and it\'s game over.
For example, at the start of the game:
Both sheep ride the boat, and go to the other side.
Then one sheep gets off, and the other goes back to the first bank.
......When it does, there are two wolves on the first bank.
And a single sheep returns there.
When that happens, there are more wolves, so the sheep is attacked and it\'s game over.
On either bank or even the boat, there must not be more wolves than sheep.
It\'s a puzzle about how to shuttle them across in the boat under these conditions.
By the way, the right answer is: On the first turn, move both wolves to the opposite bank.
Then one wolf comes back.
On the second turn, move two sheep to the opposite bank.
Then one wolf comes back.
Then on the third turn, put that last wolf that was on the right bank on the boat and cross to the opposite bank, and congratulations, transport successful.
Partway, there may be the same number of wolves and sheep in the boat or on either side, but that isn\'t a problem.
You only lose when the number of wolves is greater.
This book symbolizes it using wolves and sheep, but there are probably lots of people who know this same game with a different symbolism...
It looked like Maria wanted to test whether I too could solve the puzzles she knew how to solve,
 and she kept showing me different pages, saying "solve this one" and "this one\'s hard".
What had been happening when Auntie Rosa had said the name of this puzzle...
That\'s right.
...When we\'d decided to go call Jessica, we had been talking about how many men should go,
 and Auntie Rosa mentioned the "Wolves and Sheep Puzzle", and said that we should all go together......
".................................Wait a sec..."
That could only mean one thing.
 ...Auntie Rosa was saying that there are "wolves" among us.
And when the number of wolves and sheep is balanced, we\'re safe, but when a situation comes up where that isn\'t the case, the wolves will bear their fangs—is that what she\'s thinking......?
At the time we had found our parents\' corpses, Auntie Rosa was already suspecting that the servants might be "wolves".
While she didn\'t know whether it was all of them or just some, she had sniffed out the possibility that "wolves" were hiding among them.
......Well, yeah.
That murder scene was pretty damn elaborate.
It\'s easy to imagine that there were multiple culprits.
And considering that she had that idea already in mind when we went to Jessica\'s room,
 where Jessica had been alone with a servant, Kanon, and had been killed,
 .........it isn\'t hard to imagine why Auntie Rosa had suspected the servants so persistently...
"All you servants.
 Gohda‐san is going to the kitchen to wash the dishes.
 Just in case, would you please all go with him?"
"My apologies, everyone.
 Let us go as a group."
"......Shannon, Kumasawa.
 Let\'s go."
"Yes, yes, coming.
 Hoh‐hoh‐ho."
"Well then, George‐san, excuse me for now."
"Okay.
 .........Take care.
 Ah, Auntie Rosa, could I go as well?"
"I\'m sorry, would you remain here, George‐kun?
 There\'s something I want to talk to you about."
"......Is that so?
 Sorry, Shannon.
 Anyway, take care.
 ...Don\'t be alone."
"...Yes..."
"Excuse me, Doctor Nanjo.
 ......I wanted to consult with you about something."
"Yes, ......what might that be?
 ........................"
The servants put the dishes and empty cans on the serving cart and started to head out into the corridor.
Behind them, Auntie Rosa was talking to Doctor Nanjo about something in a small voice.
"...Alright.
 I will go."
"Yes, if you wouldn\'t mind."
Doctor Nanjo closed the book he had been reading, stood from the sofa, and followed after the servants...
Auntie Rosa stuck her head out into the hallway, and after watching them leave completely, she closed the door, and spoke.
"Listen, everyone.
 Now everyone here is an Ushiromiya."
"......Hmm?
 Yes, that is true..."
"So you\'re saying that you\'ve chased out all of the "wolves"?
 ......Auntie Rosa."
With that one sentence, Auntie Rosa\'s gaze grew sharp.
...Apparently she had picked up on my sardonic tone.
......Auntie Rosa laughed lightly.
"...Your mind sure works fast, Battler‐kun.
 I like clever kids.
 It means there\'s less to explain."
"Uu.
 Battler, smart...?
 Can you solve this?
 Hard one on page 64.
 Uu!"
"Maria, sit there watching TV for a while.
 Mama wants to talk with Battler‐kun and George‐kun."
"..................Uu."
"Auntie Rosa.
 ...I heard about the puzzle from Battler‐kun.
 ...I don\'t think it\'s bad to be very careful, but I think being too suspicious isn\'t good either."
"Whether the real culprit is {f:5:Beatrice} or not,
 I think there is reason for us to suspect that the servants are in league with her."
"......In the first murder, where Nii‐san and the others were killed,
 they\'d been given a very brutal treatment, right?
 Did that look like something that could be done alone?"
"............Maybe our mystery guest {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama worked all night and did it all."
"And the incident with the master keys involving the door to Jessica\'s room?
 Isn\'t that proof that one of the servants was involved?"
"......nn.................."
Only a master key could have locked the door to Jessica\'s room.
...In that case, we can only suppose that one of the servants locked it......
.........No,
 ......wait.
"Flip over the chessboard.
 ......That\'s strange, Auntie Rosa."
"After killing Jessica, why did the culprit go to all the trouble of locking the door?
 It was inevitable that the owners of the master keys were gonna be suspected if they did that.
 ......There was no need to deliberately lock the door."
"...Tha‐that\'s right.
 It\'s just as Battler‐kun says!
 They have no reason to deliberately go and do something that makes themselves suspicious."
"Yes.
 That\'s an interesting thought.
 Of course, I also thought that."
"......If that\'s so, then the person who locked it wanted to cast suspicion on the servants, and locked that door without a master key.
 But that\'s impossible.
 Right?"
......That\'s right.
 If there was a trick that could lock the door without a master key, this would be a good disguise aimed at casting doubt on the servants.
...If the culprit wanted to isolate us and attack us one by one, this trick was a very effective one that could even give rise to paranoia.
However, there was no way to lock that door without using a master key...
"How can you make the claim that there\'s no way to lock the door without using a master key?
 Isn\'t that a Devil\'s Proof, like Rudolf nii‐san was talking about?
 {i:Maybe it was locked by a method we can\'t think of}."
"Even if we can\'t think of it, that doesn\'t disprove that there was some unknown trick."
"............Well, sure, but...
 So is that it?
 The suspicious ones are guilty...?"
"I don\'t know the practical details of the trick, but I have a general idea.
 My apologies, but if we suppose that Kanon‐kun was the culprit, it can be explained extremely easily.
 Even as to why there was no corpse."
"Huh......
 But Kanon‐kun wasn\'t holding a master key, right?!
 Putting aside the other servants, at least Kanon‐kun shouldn\'t have been able to lock the door!"
"......I see.
 ...So that\'s why you told us to search in the closet and everywhere else right after we entered Jessica\'s room.
 ......Auntie Rosa, ...your mind works faster than I could imagine judging by your normal appearance."
"The brain speed of a little sister is always the big sister\'s minus 1.
 ...I feel glad that there\'s no one I need to worry about now."
George‐aniki realized that she was referring to Auntie Eva,
 and seemed a little disturbed about how he should take that nasty remark...
"......I, I\'m sorry.
 Could you explain it so that even I can understand?"
"Kanon‐kun\'s master key was in Jessica‐chan\'s pocket, closed up inside a locked room.
 After the door was locked, it should have been impossible for him to pull a stunt like putting it in her pocket from outside the room...!"
"That\'s not it, Aniki.
 ......If it was done in the way Auntie Rosa imagines, ......this trick could only be used by Kanon‐kun."
"...And, the door could be locked without a key, while the master key was still in Jessica\'s pocket.
 ......And, as a result, his corpse would also disappear."
"H‐......how?!
 How would he lock the door without a key?!"
"It\'s simple.
 George‐kun, when you return home, you lock the door, right?
 You twist the knob, click, right?"
"Huh...?!
 .........C‐
...could it be...
 ......No, but...
...Kanon‐kun wasn\'t anywhere......"
"...It looks like you\'ve got it, Aniki.
 .........That\'s what Auntie Rosa was searching inside the room for."
"......She was searching for Kanon‐kun, who had locked the door from the inside, stuck the key in Jessica\'s pocket,
 and was hiding somewhere, waiting for us to go away."
The simplest locked‐room trick.
 ...In other words, to hide inside the locked room after committing the murder.
...And if he could get out after those who discovered the body left, it would create a perfect locked‐room murder......
"We searched that room, but we couldn\'t find anything.
 ...But, that doesn\'t mean we can rule out something like a secret hidden passage in that room that only the servants know about."
"I don\'t know where that might be hidden,
 but if we assume that there was a hidden passage, we can say for certain that it was impossible for anyone except him."
"..................You know, that line of reasoning,
 ...it was the first thing I thought of, too.
 ......It\'s the reasoning I hate the most, so I wanted to destroy it in the very beginning..."
"*cackle*cackle*...
 "
Kanon was killed in this room}", yes?"
"Because you seemed to suspect Kanon as the culprit, you made me repeat this to destroy that possibility right away.
 I understand, I understand.
 *cackle*......"
"...So this is what I thought of next.
 A theory that there were actually three people in that room.
 Jessica and Kanon‐kun were victims.
 And the culprit, the guest {f:5:Beatrice}, was also there with them."
"You wanted to make it "the human me" who committed the crime without using magic.
 I see, a strange theory that fits you perfectly.
 *giggle*giggle*."
"......I guessed that you killed those two, then locked the door from the inside.
 And you carried Kanon‐kun\'s corpse using some secret method that normal people wouldn\'t notice.
 ......In other words, you used a secret door to escape."
"But you told me it in red.
 ...You said that there are no types of hidden doors in that room."
"Indeed.
 No secret passage exists unknown to you all.
 Was it Knox, or was it Van Dine?
 It seems that in mystery novels, there must never be hidden passages, no matter what.
 I also follow that etiquette."
"In other words, even without having to thoroughly search a room, great detectives can state with confidence that there are no secret passages.
 .........*cackle*cackle*, humans have it so easy with their little detective games."
"Damn you, talking so big...
 Thanks.
 Thanks to the witch\'s arrangement, I can say for sure that the room doesn\'t have a hidden door without searching the whole thing."
"Indeed.
 
There are no hidden doors in this room}.
 
There is no way to get in or out other than the door and the windows}."
"......Which means...
...that theory Auntie Rosa\'s so confident in...
...is wrong."
"...Plus, frustratingly, it\'s impossible to disprove that theory.
 ......If you, the witch, say in red
 "

there are no hidden doors}", then it\'s settled."
"......However, no matter how much a human like me tries to argue against her, Auntie Rosa probably won\'t accept it.
 {i:Humans can\'t prove there\'s no hidden door}."
"It\'s a Devil\'s Proof.
 ...............Damn.
 Sure is convenient being a witch..."
"......No way!
 You\'re calling Kanon‐kun the culprit because of a hidden door that we don\'t even know exists...
 I...can\'t accept that."
"If you can\'t accept that, tell me some reasoning that\'s easier to accept, then?
 .........There is none.
 I\'ve been thinking the whole time.
 There\'s nothing but this!"
".............................."
"George‐kun, you had a good relationship with Shannon‐chan, right?
 So I think it would be hard for you to accept that all of the servants are the culprits."
"I also don\'t want to believe that Shannon‐chan is one of the culprits.
 .........But whether it\'s all of them or not, the culprit, or maybe an accomplice, is definitely in that group.
 You must not fail to see that!"
"......If you thought that there were more wolves in addition to Kanon‐kun,
 ...then causing that uproar by saying that Kanon‐kun was the culprit in Jessica\'s room was to see the servants\' reactions...?"
"Yes, that\'s right.
 And as a result, I began to suspect them even more.
 ......I\'m certain there are wolves among the servants.
 Certain.
 And, just like the "Wolves and Sheep Puzzle", while they are normally docile, they will surely attack if they get the chance."
"......Jessica‐chan was a lone sheep on the boat.
 ......In that puzzle, they may not attack when there is a balance between wolves and sheep, but our puzzle is different.
 Depending on the opportunity and the number of people, they\'ll attack even if there is a balance.
 Just like when Jessica‐chan was killed!"
".........Th‐there\'s something I don\'t like!
 In that case, Shannon, who you sent to the kitchen, is in a dangerous situation, isn\'t she?!!
 We should also go to the kitchen right now!
 No matter who might or might not be a wolf!
 If we can form a balance by gathering together, I think we should maintain that!!"
"......Shannon‐chan went to see Father along with Genji‐san.
 She was isolated then, but she wasn\'t killed."
"Because Genji‐san wasn\'t a wolf either?"
"......No!
 Because they were both wolves!!"
"Shannon isn\'t the kind of person who would take part in a crime!!
 Even if it\'s you, Auntie Rosa, I cannot ignore that.
 I demand that you take back what you just said...!"
"...I hate to say this in front of Aniki, but that argument...
...feels just like something Auntie Eva would say.
 If we can\'t argue back, then you automatically assume that you\'re right.
 ......Looks like you can\'t fight your blood after all, Auntie."
".........Even I don\'t think of myself as very praiseworthy right now."
"But you know what? I\'m a mother!
 I would even become a demon to protect Maria\'s safety.
 Honestly speaking, I wish I could just shut myself away somewhere alone with Maria."
"......But I also plan to act as a mother to you two.
 Right now, you are as good as my children.
 ......You may not be my own children, ...but I won\'t forsake you.
 .........Ever."
"......Sure, thanks."
"I just wanted to warn you not to be careless, as your mother.
 {i:Always remain where I can see you}.
 I will protect you."
"And at the same time, you\'ll be observing us to make sure we aren\'t "wolves".
 ...Yeah, thanks a lot for that.
 Can you prove that you aren\'t a "wolf" yourself?"
"Yes, I can."
"That\'s a quick answer.
 How?"
"With this.
 ...This is my proof."
Auntie Rosa held up the gun, and pointed the barrel at me.
But that was only for an instant.
She immediately lowered the gun, laughing impishly.
......But to me, the time I spent staring down the barrel of the gun had felt like an eternity.
"...How does that gun prove that you aren\'t the culprit, Auntie Rosa?"
"Think about it.
 What if I were the culprit?
 Do you think I would let by this once‐in‐a‐lifetime chance I got when the servants left?"
"I could just shoot you both, bang, and all that\'s left is to come out with a fitting excuse.
 Something like, {f:5:Beatrice} appeared outside the window and shot at us with a gun.
 I would claim that I fired two shots back at her, and throw the two shots\' worth of empty cartridges onto the floor."
"That\'s a crazy wild argument, but it does make sense. Ihihihi!"
"There\'s something Krauss nii‐san often used to say.
 Might makes right.
 .........I wonder if this proves that?"
".........I\'m sorry, you two.
 I\'ve lost a lot of my composure after all these crimes since morning.
 You know how I normally am, so right now I must seem on‐edge and a little short‐tempered."
"...But understand.
 I want to protect you from the malicious culprit.
 I will become a demon to do that.
 That\'s all there is to it.
 ......I\'m sorry for saying something that\'s angered you.
 Battler‐kun, George‐kun.
 ...Let\'s make up."
George‐aniki was wearing an unsatisfied expression.
...He probably couldn\'t forgive the damage done to Shannon\'s honor.
...What about me...?
 Several bits of circumstantial evidence hint strongly at the servants\' participation.
......I don\'t want to believe that one of them is the culprit, or possibly colluding with the culprit,
 ...but in the current situation, that\'s nothing but wishful thinking.
Who should I believe?
In the first place, who is the culprit?
Are there accomplices?
If so, how many?!
......I feel like I\'m constantly only suspecting the people connected to all this.
...I find myself quickly forgetting about that 19th person,
 the guest, {f:5:Beatrice}, who came yesterday and boldly called herself the Golden Witch.
I haven\'t actually seen her face.
I\'ve heard that she\'s like a double of the witch in that portrait,
 but because I haven\'t seen her directly, no matter how hard I try, I can\'t really feel like there are 19 people on this island.
...So I easily slip into the illusion that the culprit is one of the 18...
Damn it......
 Come out, {f:5:Beatrice}.
If you\'re the bad guy, then act like the bad guy, and show yourself, laughing in a high‐pitched voice and looking down on us.
Just like a bad guy in one of those dramas who, even once they\'re exposed as the culprit,
 aggressively says "is there any proof?"
"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*.
 Is there any proof?"
"Shut up, you keep your trap shut for a minute..."
There were five humans in the kitchen, but it was very quiet, filled only with the sound of the rain.
It was only accented by the sound of Shannon and Kumasawa washing the dishes.
Gohda was using the leftovers from breakfast and lunch as ingredients for a servants\' soup.
......Rosa had suspected that poison might have been added to the food, so they had decided to eat canned food, but it hadn\'t really been filling.
But Gohda thought that she was being too careful.
So he was spontaneously creating a soup to be served only to those that wanted to eat it.
Shannon and Kumasawa were washing the dishes that the food had been arranged on.
On the inside, they thought maybe Gohda should be the one to wash them since he had been the one who wanted the food on plates in the first place,
 but they left their complaints unsaid for the time being.
Genji and Nanjo were facing each other across a crude chess set which had seen many years.
...It had still only just begun.
And because the opening game of the experienced players had been endlessly refined,
 it looked like a ritual where they just moved specified pieces in a specified order.
"That\'s a nice aroma...
 You wouldn\'t get this from canned food."
"It was made only from sealed ingredients, so there won\'t be any poison mixed in."
"I have made enough for everybody, so please, eat.
 Of course, I will also taste for poison.
 Please feel secure and eat."
"That really is a nice aroma.
 Gohda‐san, your makeshift servant meals really are delicious."
"It\'s natural that you can create delicious food if you buy delicious ingredients.
 ......My teacher taught me that perfecting your ability to make delicious food from whatever is at hand is what makes you a true cook."
"That was a good teacher.
 Thanks to him, it looks like I shall be able to enjoy some truly delicious soup."
"......Although it is a shame that it was made from ingredients intended for all of the family members to eat."
"I\'m sure that Rosa‐san is also tired after everything that happened this morning.
 It is only natural."
"But thanks to that, we get to eat some soup made from delicious ingredients, hoh‐hoh‐ho."
Rosa had fervently told everyone that they didn\'t realize the danger they were in, and that they must suspect that poison was mixed in with the food.
The atmosphere in that place had led to their agreement,
 but their hunger wouldn\'t be overcome by that momentary emotion.
"Ironically, it has become a soup that we normally wouldn\'t be able to savor.
 If possible, I would like to also serve it to everyone in the parlor, but..."
"......Seeing as that goes against Rosa‐sama\'s instructions, you\'d better not.
 ......Those who want to eat it can do so."
"Hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho.
 Skillfully taking a breather when no one is looking is one of the things you learn as a servant, after all."
Kumasawa laughed loudly, and Shannon and Gohda laughed with her.
It seemed that, in an area where only their fellow servants were gathered, they could be very relaxed.
Shannon didn\'t like Gohda\'s occasional dishonesty,
 but she knew that there was no falsehood in his childish smile when he cooked,
 nor in his desire that people enjoy his food.
So even though it was a little aggravating to be made to wash the dishes,
 she couldn\'t really hate him.
However, they couldn\'t have dreamed that Rosa was calling them wolves in the parlor at exactly the same moment that they were spending their time peacefully like this......
At that time, several of the servants heard a sound like something was being dragged, and then a thump.
When a servant was out carrying a mountain of trash bags on a rainy day,
 or doing some work in a raincoat, they would create exactly this kind of noise and presence as they returned and hovered around the back door.
So after hearing that sound, at first, none of them noticed anything out of the ordinary...
But they quickly realized.
 ............In a situation where everyone was either in the kitchen or the parlor, who in the world was at the back door...?!
As the servants all looked at each other, they checked to make sure that each one of them knew what that sound meant.
"Who, ..........who could it be......?"
The servants knew the mansion\'s layout well.
So they understood how unimaginable it would be for someone from the parlor to actually go outside in this typhoon,
 go all the way around, and come up to this back door.
Then was it Kinzo?
 ...They found it even more difficult to imagine that Kinzo, who never left his study even under normal conditions,
 would dash out into the middle of this typhoon for no apparent reason, and come to the back of the house, where only low‐class people came in or out.
"......Tha‐
......that wasn\'t...
our imagination, was it......?"
".............Awawawawawawawawa..."
Shannon and Kumasawa drew close together, fearfully looking at the back door...
"...Who, ...who is it......?"
As Gohda fearfully approached the back door, he called out.
......And he checked with his eyes the location of a butcher\'s knife set on a nearby sink.
......He didn\'t pick it up yet.
Because there was still a possibility that this was a member of the family.
However, that possibility wasn\'t possible...
There was no response from across the door to Gohda\'s initial question.
...Maybe his voice had been so quiet that it hadn\'t reached through all the wind and rain outside.
".........Genji‐san."
"......Yes.
 .........Stand back, Doctor Nanjo and the women."
"...Who, ......who in the world could it be......"
Genji took a knife with a classical design from a stationery box placed near the chess set.
...It was something to be used instead of a paper knife to open envelopes for invoices and bills.
But it was fundamentally a knife.
So the blade on it could injure someone...
Genji hid it in his sleeve with a well‐practiced manner.
Then he too approached the back door, and signaled to Gohda with a silent nod.
Gohda cautiously approached the back door, .........and slowly started to open it......
"Wa...wahyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa...!!!"
The figure of a person suddenly shuffled into sight, landed on its knees, and fell over.
Gohda fell backwards onto his backside in shock.
That figure was soaked with rain, smeared with mud, and drenched with blood...
"K‐............Kanon‐kun?!
 Kanon‐kun!!"
".........Kanon.
 Are you alright...?
 Doctor Nanjo...!"
It was Kanon.
......His breath was feeble, ......and the puddles of mud he left quickly became drenched bright‐red.
When Nanjo held him and turned him face up, there was a deep, gruesome scar right in the center of his chest, as though he had been run through with a spear or something.
Even now, deep‐red blood poured out from there...!
"Th‐th‐th‐...this is horrible...
 Wh‐what shall we do—first aid kit? First aid kit?!"
"Kanon‐san, put your hand against the wound!
 Please, push firmly!
 Let\'s carry him to the bed in the servant room!!
 Everyone, please, lend a hand."
"C‐come now, Kanon‐san!
 Please, hang in there a little longer...!"
"Hang in there!!
 It\'s alright now!!
 So don\'t take your hand from the wound...!!"
"Anyway, let\'s carry him to the servant room.
 ......Kumasawa, inform Rosa‐sama that we have found Kanon."
"Wai‐.........wait.........
 ......Not...
......Rosa‐sama........."
"...Please wait!
 Kanon‐san said not Rosa‐sama..."
"......Wh‐what do you mean, Kanon‐kun...!"
"............Not now.
 Let\'s carry him to the servant room quickly.
 Kumasawa, don\'t tell Rosa‐sama yet.
 ...We\'ll do it after we hear the situation from Kanon."
"Y‐......yes......
 ......hiiiiii..."
After appearing in this horrible state, he had said not to tell Rosa.
......That could only mean something very disquieting.
......An eerie sense of panic rose to their faces...
"C‐come now, everyone!
 Let\'s hurry and carry him...!
 Quickly, quickly...!"
Kanon\'s wound was unbelievably deep,
 ...and judging from Nanjo\'s pale face, it was almost a miracle that he was still conscious...
"......This is......horrible...
 It appears that he has been stabbed with something like a spear.
 I‐if it hasn\'t reached the lungs, I might be able to do something......
 Anyway, stop the bleeding......!"
"u...guo......aaaaga!!!"
No matter how much Nanjo tried to wipe off that gushing deep‐red blood, ...he couldn\'t wipe it he couldn\'t wipe it he couldn\'t wipe it all away...!
 And each time, the wound was aggravated, causing Kanon to cry in anguish...
"Kanon‐kun, Kanon‐kun Kanon‐kun!
 Hang in there... Hang in there...!!"
"Doctor Nanjo!
 A new towel...!
 ...How...horrible...!!"
"What is his condition...?"
".........In all honesty, ...it is so severe that I cannot believe he is alive...
 Maybe the location of the stab was fortunate...
 But the blood loss is too horrible...!
 A blood transfusion is necessary, but that\'s impossible until tomorrow...!"
"......u...
...*cough*cough*!!
 Ro‐
......Rosa‐sama...
......she......
ugaaaaaa!!"
"D‐don\'t talk, Kanon‐kun!
 Your wound will open...!"
"......Rosa‐sama...came...
......t‐
......to Milady and...
...me, and........."
"Wh‐......what did you say......"
"Rosa‐sama......did...?
 Oooooh... Could that mean, could that mean..."
"......Are you certain?"
"Yes.........
 ......I\'m certain......it was Rosa‐sama........."
"Come now, don\'t speak any more...!
 Kumasawa‐san, please grab another first aid kit!"
".........Genji‐san.
 ......Is it possible Rosa‐sama......did such a thing?"
"............I don\'t know."
Disregarding Nanjo and Kumasawa, who were struggling hard and stained with blood as they tried to stop the bleeding, Genji and Gohda faced each other...
......Because if what Kanon had said was the truth,
 ......Rosa was the culprit who killed Jessica.
"Curse you, Rosa......
 How could you do that...to Milady......
 ...I\'m gonna kill you......ugnnnggg...!"
Kanon screamed even more hatefully...
...His hate‐filled voice made it seem like he had seen Jessica being harmed right before his eyes.
"......Cer‐certainly, Rosa‐sama may have had a reason to kill Milady.
 If the Ushiromiya family was wiped out, the inheritance would all go to Rosa‐sama..."
"If so, Battler‐sama and George‐sama are in danger...!
 Not only is Rosa‐sama holding a gun, but right now, they are the only ones in the parlor...!
 Genji‐san, isn\'t this quite perilous......?!"
"................................."
".............................."
Shannon suddenly ran out into the corridor.
...Her expression was complex and tragic, as though she didn\'t know what to believe...
Shannon ran.
 To where?
......The inside of the mansion had been scrupulously cleaned, so they probably wouldn\'t be easy to find.
She might find some if she searched the rose garden, but they would probably have all been lost in this wind and rain...
That\'s right, ......the boiler room isn\'t cleaned very often.
...If she went there, ......she might be able to find some...
Shannon ran down the stairs to search for {i:those} in the underground boiler room...
Had some medicine taken effect at the brink of death,
 or had Kanon finally stopped even feeling pain?
...For the time being, Kanon had at least gotten over his painful gasping.
Nanjo apparently didn\'t think of this as that great of a trend, and didn\'t let his eyes off Kanon for a second.
Kumasawa firmly gripped Kanon\'s hand, and kept encouraging him, so that his will to stay alive didn\'t fall asleep.
Genji and Gohda seemed bewildered at how to deal with the truth that Kanon had risked his life to deliver...
".........I believe Rosa‐sama\'s gun had four or five shots loaded."
"That is no small number.
 ...But loading cartridges into that gun should require quite a lot of practice.
 We might unfortunately allow her to get one shot off, but if everyone attacks her at once, we should be able to take the gun from her before she shoots again..."
".........On this island, we may have a doctor, but there\'s no medicine, and no hospital.
 ......If you\'re shot in the wrong place, ...you\'re dead."
"I understand that, but...
 More importantly, if we don\'t move quickly, there is also the possibility that another crime will occur...!
 I get the feeling that Rosa‐sama skillfully chased us out.
 There is a possibility that George‐sama and Battler‐sama are being killed right about now...!"
"..........................."
"......Ho...hohohohoho.
 If the opponent is so dangerous, wouldn\'t it be better if we didn\'t provoke them too much...?"
"But there is still much time before tomorrow comes...!
 We can\'t even imagine what strategy she will use!
 Genji‐san, we should be the ones to make the first move.
 If we can at least take the gun from her under some pretext, things might work out...!"
"There are four or five cartridges, are there not?
 That means there aren\'t enough to kill all of us...
 If we don\'t carelessly provoke her, surely even Rosa‐sama wouldn\'t recklessly—"
"............No, she said it.
 She said she\'ll massacre all of us."
Kanon, who they thought had been sleeping quietly, suddenly started talking brightly.
Almost like he had been awake the whole time and had suddenly opened his mouth.
He looked firm and steady, and Nanjo was slightly relieved, but thinking of the deepness of that wound, he just couldn\'t wipe away a certain creepy feeling.
......He knew because he was a doctor.
Kanon should have been expected to fall unconscious after losing so much blood.
And yet somehow, he had preserved his awareness so clearly.
......Youth?
 Or tenacity?
...Sometimes the power of human life did surpass common knowledge......
When they had stopped the bleeding, to make sure there were no foreign objects inside the affected area,
 Nanjo had groped around a bit inside the bleeding hole with tweezers, and the great depth of the wound had surprised him.
...The wound had certainly reached as far as his lungs.
......And yet, ...and yet...
......No, on the other hand, the fact that he is alive is fortunate...
......But Kanon had spoken clearly.
...He had hatefully said that the one named Rosa had created this wound, and was repeating curses and enraged words.
"...She wants to kill everyone by any means necessary before the typhoon passes, so that she can have the Master\'s wealth all to herself.
 She told me that clearly."
".........Damn...!
 What a person...
 Genji‐san, what should we do?!
 Do we also not need some kind of weapons...?"
"......I can\'t believe it so suddenly.
 ......That Rosa‐sama would do something like......"
"Genji‐sama, it isn\'t a question of whether you believe or not.
 She told me.
 I heard it.
 {f:5:Why} won\'t you believe me?"
"D‐don\'t get up...
 You\'ll worsen your wound..."
Kanon sat up on the bed, and spoke to Genji, who was making no effort to believe Kanon\'s story.
"She will definitely kill all of us.
 She\'s surely killed all of the people in the parlor by now.
 If we don\'t kill her first, it will absolutely be us who are killed first.
 Just like how I was killed first, everyone else will also be killed first.
 Kill or be killed.
 Kill or be killed kill or be killed."
"...K‐.........Kanon‐san, ......you...
 ......Does it really not hurt...?"
"......Oh, this?
 It isn\'t a serious wound."
"Wh‐...what do you mean, not a serious wound, ...you......"
"It really isn\'t a big deal.
 It doesn\'t hurt at all anymore—it really isn\'t a serious wound."
As Kanon said that, he began to untie his own bandages which had been painstakingly wrapped...
The gruesome hole in his chest was immediately exposed...
"K‐Kanon‐san...!
 You mustn\'t do something like that!
 Quickly, lie down...!"
"I said it\'s fine.
 ......Look.
 See...?
 It\'s...not...a serious wound, right...?"
Kanon showed off his gaping wound, which was still slowly spitting out foamy blood.
...Everyone averted their eyes reflexively.
"See, I told you that it wasn\'t a serious wound at all..."
"S‐......stop that... You mustn\'t play with your wound......"
"...Look, see?
 ......It isn\'t a deep wound...at all.
 .........Look.
 ..................Look."
Kanon held up two fingers, showed them to everyone, and slowly started to stick them into the gruesome wound right in the center of his chest...
......Plunging, slimy, squishy, wet.
The fingers...went in deep...to the base...
 ......Squich, gloop, blorp...
"Hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii...!!
 K‐K‐K‐Kanon‐san, stop it, stop it...!!"
Having stuck his fingers completely into his chest......up to their base,
 ......he slowly pulled them out in exactly the same way...
The fingers he pulled out were stained a sticky, solid, deep‐red color, and there was even a thread hanging...
...The fingers were, all the way to their base, covered......in deep red...
"......Y‐
.........you...
 ......Wh‐wh‐wh‐what in the world.................."
".........See?
 It is...not a serious wound...at all, you see?
 *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!"
Just then, the door opened vigorously, and Shannon appeared.
...Even after she saw Kanon stained with fresh blood, her impregnable expression didn\'t falter.
"......Hey, Nee‐san.
 Where\'d you go?
 I\'m on the verge of death here, where\'d you go?"
"Well.
 I went to the boiler room.
 Looking for something.
 .........More importantly, I want to check.
 Are you really...Kanon‐kun?"
"......Huh, ......huhh...?"
It was only natural.
 Everyone believed he was Kanon.
So they couldn\'t understand the meaning of Shannon\'s question.
When they looked, they noticed that Shannon was holding a handkerchief in her hand.
It was filthy, and looked like she had wiped up some trash or dust.
And while holding that, she approached Kanon, .........and drew close to his legs.
"What is that......?"
"It\'s a handkerchief with a spider\'s web wiped onto it."
".....................
 ...Why something like that?"
"If you\'re Kanon‐kun, you should be alright.
 ......But if {i:spiders are your natural enemy}, I thought you might hate it."
"...........................
 Hahaha, oh no.
 Why would I hate spiders?"
"Sorry, I\'ll try it."
"......Sha‐...Shannon‐san."
When Shannon brought that handkerchief close to Kanon\'s thigh, ......something happened in an instant.
It happened all at once.
 The human eye couldn\'t have followed it.
Kanon jumped back like a wild goat, ...fleeing from the thing Shannon was holding.
And his arm drew trails with some kind of afterglow that flashed purple.
They were three beautiful purple trails drawn in an arc, and they were traced across the throats of Nanjo and Kumasawa, who had been tending to him.
And Nanjo and Kumasawa\'s throats......had opened like gaping mouths, ...and it was the very instant before the blood was about to start spewing out.
The third purple trail should have traced across Shannon\'s throat.
But Shannon wasn\'t there.
Because Genji, who had been behind her, had wrapped his own arm around Shannon\'s neck and pulled her back.
This all happened in an instant.
"...........................!!!"
In the instant Gohda tried to think fast in an attempt to understand this scene, the frozen moment in time shattered.
Blood spewed forcefully from Nanjo and Kumasawa\'s necks, which had been torn open.
Still mid‐jump, Kanon wall‐kicked off a picture frame that had been hanging from the wall behind him, springing forward just like a cat, and aiming for Shannon\'s throat again.
But Kanon\'s target once again disappeared from in front of him.
 Because Genji had pulled Shannon again, and the two of them had fallen onto the ground, keeping flat to the floor.
"Nice reflexes, you senile old piece of furniture!!"
"......Gohda!"
"Uu...uooooooooooooooooooooooooooohhh!!"
Gohda wasn\'t an idiot either.
 Even if he couldn\'t fully understand what was going on, he at least realized that if this "Kanon" wasn\'t seized, his own life would also be in peril.
He sprung at Kanon with his huge body, pushing him up against the wall with his weight and physical strength.
"Uuuoooooooooooooooooohhh...! Ooaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!!"
"Let...me...go, you fatass!!"
The tips of the fingers on Kanon\'s right hand began to trace out another purple trail.
And when he raised that blade‐hand up, aiming to strike at Gohda\'s back, there was a loud thunk.
Because Kanon\'s raised blade‐hand had been pinned to the wall.
He couldn\'t tear his palm away from the wall.
Sticking out from it was the knife Genji had thrown.
Under normal circumstances, it should have been surprising to see someone as old as Genji handle a knife so skillfully,
 but in this abnormal space, no one paid it much mind.
"Genji‐sama, here...!"
"......Yes."
Genji took the handkerchief with the spiderweb stuck to it from Shannon.
And he approached Kanon, who was pinned to the wall by Gohda\'s massive body and the knife.
"Sto‐stop it...!!
 Don\'t co—Don\'t come near me with that...!!
 Stop it, sto‐stop!!"
"Gyaooooooooooooaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!!"
When Genji pushed the handkerchief up against Kanon\'s face,
 ...there was a sound just like the one you hear when you set meat on a red‐hot iron plate.
Of course, the smell was the same too.
 As he was burned and inflamed, festering in filthy red and black, and cried out in his death throes, Kanon\'s body burst open and scattered.
It was almost as though a balloon filled with gold leaf had popped.
The entire servant room was completely buried under a storm of gold leaf—no, a rabble of gold butterflies...
Those butterflies began to softly fade into nothingness, as though dissolving into water, no, into the air itself,
 ......and afterwards, all that was left was the three of them sitting on their behinds, stained with blood.
However, not everyone was just stained with blood.
Some of them were lying on the ground, vomiting blood themselves.
"...Kumasawa...!
 ......Doctor Nanjo...!
 ....................."
A slit so sharp that it looked like it could cut your finger if you touched it was opened wide, causing large amounts of blood to keep pouring out...
"What was that, .........j‐...just now............"
"..........................."
".........Gohda.
 Have you been injured?"
"I, I am alright...
 But.........what did we see?!
 What happened?!
 E‐ev‐ev‐......even though I definitely pushed that thing against this wall with this very hand!"
"{i:I cannot understand what happened}...!!"
Gohda looked at his own hand.
The bright‐red blood left from his scuffle with Kanon...definitely remained.
...And yet, Kanon was nowhere to be seen.
Because he had disappeared.
He had turned into gold butterflies and scattered.
Gohda kept screaming alone that he had no clue about what was going on.
Shannon sobbed in front of Nanjo\'s and Kumasawa\'s remains,
 ...and Genji watched over her, silent as always...
