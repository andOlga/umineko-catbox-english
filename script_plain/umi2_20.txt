"Well then.
 ...Did you enjoy it?
 Our game just now."
"......A game that one‐sided goes beyond captivating and becomes boring."
"*cackle*cackle*. My, my, a harsh critic as always.
 ......And I was so certain that even Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}, who has no love for boredom,
 would surely be satisfied by this compelling development... How remorseless."
"...Well, I\'ll accept that it was compelling.
 ...However, it was horrible as a fair game.
 You need the conditions to be a little more even, or—"
"......Am I about to be told there\'s no way to win?
 By Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}?
 ......*cackle*cackle*."
"..................I wonder what you mean by that, Beato."
"There\'s no need to play ignorant.
 I already know.
 ...That you {i:aren\'t a bystander}."
"................................."
"You thought you were hiding it?
 How insolent, to travel all that way, and come into territory that isn\'t yours, just to bet against me.
 You came here planning to watch my game from the sidelines, while having a large stake placed in my defeat.
 I\'ve guessed right, haven\'t I...?"
"...........................
 And if so?"
"......*cackle*cackle*!
 Truly interesting!"
"That I should be granted a chance to fight against Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}, the strongest of witches who defeated Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}, is truly a pleasure!!"
"......Yes.
 It is pleasing me too.
 After all, I came all this way just because I wanted to see you brimming with that confidence, only to fall apart and lose."
"What an honest person.
 *cackle*cackle*!!"
"Incidentally, if the contest between me and the great Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}...
were not to have at least one observer, what a tremendous shame that would be."
".................................
 ...You called her, didn\'t you.
 That child."
"Hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho!
 I found you, I finally found you, {f:5:Bernkastel}!!"
"............How are you, Lambda?
 Looks like you also have time to kill.
 ...I wonder if it\'s fate that we who share no love for boredom should run into each other again...?"
"Such a dumb kid.
 Why can\'t you realize that the only reason you won against me was because of a little luck and a not‐so‐great matchup?
 That made you so snobby, and now you\'re even picking a fight with {f:5:Beatrice}? Shouldn\'t you learn your place?"
"*giggle*, {f:5:Beatrice} is strong, you know.
 And she\'s more brutal than I am.
 Just a teensy bit!"
"Oh and also, don\'t just shorten someone\'s name to Lambda!"
".........You\'re a fool too, Beato.
 This kid won\'t make exceptions for your game, she\'ll turn everything into a preposterous farce."
"I didn\'t bring Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta} here solely to watch from the sidelines."
"After I informed her that you were betting against me, she said that she would bet against you."
"..............................You\'re still holding a grudge, aren\'t you."
"Hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho!!
 \'Cause I\'m the strongest witch in the universe.
 But I lost to you so I\'m not the strongest!"
"So I\'m taking the side of anyone who\'s against youuuu!!"
"*cackle*cackle*!
 There you have it.
 With the great Lady {f:5:Bernkastel} as our opponent, this may not even count as a handicap, but it will be suitable for entertainment."
"...............Do as you like.
 ...Now that the cat\'s out of the bag, I\'m going to get serious."
"That would be suitable.
 "Leniency" has never featured in my dictionary.
 *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!
 Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}, let us enjoy our valuable new relationship."
"Yes, I\'ll be counting on you, Lady {f:5:Beatrice}!
 This girl really put me through the wringer.
 I\'m not gonna be happy until the two of us have smushed her up and paid her back double!!"
"............I look forward to it, Lambda.
 And Beato.
 ...No matter who wins or who loses, this will be a very meaningful battle for us."
"That\'s right.
 Of course, I\'m not gonna lose easy, but this is more important than winning and losing."
"After all, we have no love for boredom."
The three witches giggled, cackled, and guffawed.
"......That\'s right.
 I should thank you, Beato.
 It looks like I can finally escape boredom.
 Do your best to entertain me.
 Together with {f:5:Lambdadelta}."
"I shall do just that.
 *cackle*cackle*...!!"
"That\'s that, Beato, so let\'s start a strategy meeting right now!
 I know all of this girl\'s weak points, and I\'m gonna teach you all of them!"
"And yet, Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}, you were defeated by her, I note... *cackle*cackle*...!"
"Urrrrrrrrgggh, I won\'t tell you, I won\'t tell you!
 Tsuun!"
"*cackle*cackle* hahhahahahahahaha!
 ...She never bores, that Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}."
"............She doesn\'t, does she?
 Take care of her.
 She might not look it, but she gets lonely."
"I see.
 So she\'s one of those newfangled whatchamacallits.
 *cackle*, as expected from Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}.
 Quite cutting edge.
 *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*."
"Go already.
 That child\'s waiting for you to chase after her."
"......Then, if you\'ll excuse me."
"See you next game.
 *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!"
......I\'m sorry.
 A troublesome one came, but don\'t mind her.
More importantly,
 .........things sure got ugly.
I thought I had experienced some particularly gruesome ends in my game with Lambda,
 .........but this time, ......it\'s exceptionally horrible.
...It isn\'t as though I don\'t understand your desire to hug your knees and close your heart.
If you meet that end several more times,
 your heart will be killed within a hundred years.
......Beato saw through me, so I\'ll confess.
You are now just like I was in the past, when I was imprisoned inside Lambda\'s world.
Shut inside a labyrinth of cruel fate, tormented at the whims of a witch.
...I am a witch who was born from there.
......So maybe I\'m like an older sister to you.
 So I decided that I\'d lend you my power.
However,
 ............even compared to my fate,
 ......yours is...truly brutal.
Not only do I sympathize with you, I\'m almost brought to tears by your tragic fate.
But please, don\'t lose heart.
Please don\'t submit to Beato, no matter what.
Certainly, that child\'s game is quite unfair.
I took a glimpse of the game board, and the tricks are so mean and cunning,
 and the scenic tricks are filthy to a degree that probably far surpasses that of {f:5:Lambdadelta}\'s game board.
And what\'s even more frightening is that when that child moves a piece, it\'s not like she always makes the best possible move.
This is where she is very different from Lambda.
Lambda always uses an overpowering number of pieces and makes the best possible move, in order to win.
But Beato sometimes intentionally eases up when she moves her pieces.
This is unfortunate for us, trying to seek out our opponent\'s strategy by looking at her moves,
 because it creates a formidable amount of noise in our information.
This disorder could be troublesome.
......However, as in chess,
 a player might be able to create some noise for their opponent with a useless move, but they would still miss out on a more valuable move.
In other words, it\'s not like your opportunities to take advantage of it are zero.
Although you may not be able to believe it, this game was also like that.
......Even though those developments looked so overpowering,
 ...there actually were weak points.
It looks almost as if she wants us to take advantage of them.
......Although, I don\'t know if it\'s a trap or if she\'s testing us.
Anyway, don\'t surrender.
Don\'t stop thinking.
Don\'t deny any possibility.
As long as you continue to hold the will to fight, Beato will not win.
Defense is crucial during a witch\'s battle, you know?
Rather than trying to win, try not to lose.
...If you lose when you accept her, then you definitely must not accept her.
......Making you accept witches.
There is no longer any doubt that this is one of {f:5:Beatrice}\'s victory conditions.
Now that I have announced that I am your ally, I too will make an effort to lend you as much of my power as I can.
Make an effort yourself as well.
If you\'re still hugging your knees, quickly stand back up.
......Umm, in times like this, what did I use to say again?
.........Umm, uh,
 .........Fi‐
...fight,
 yea~h.
 Mii,
 nipah~{p:0:☆}
..................It\'s so embarrassing, doing this.
......I\'ve done this much for you, so hurry and stand back up.
"...Ah, there you are.
 Did Bern shrink off somewhere?
 *giggle*, could she be any more lame?"
Anywho.
The pieces Bern chooses are crummy as usual, huh.
It\'s the same with chess, right?
If all your pieces were pawns, you\'d have zero chance to win, right?
If all your pieces were rooks and bishops, no way you\'d lose.
......W‐well, last time, I felt just a little pity and said that she could start her pieces anywhere she wants,
 and then that idiot Bern totally didn\'t pick up on my compassion and started with aaall of her pawns promoted on the eighth rank!!
What\'s up with that, that wasn\'t a loss or anything!!
 Aaah, just remembering that makes me queasy.
So, see, I\'m gonna be ruffled until I see Bern\'s stupid speechless face.
So it\'s like, seeing you in this state as Bern\'s piece, that makes me feel just awesome!
Plus, believe it or not, that girl really hates to lose,
 so I bet she\'s definitely grinding her teeth in frustration right about now, crying like a baby,
 she\'s so lame, *giggle*, hohhh‐hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho!
C\'mon, laugh with me, oh‐hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho!
............Wait a sec.
Are you still hugging your knees?
You\'re already like this just because Beato got a little serious?
Could you be any more pathetic?
You\'re so pathetic, I\'ll help you just a little bit.
I, the great Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}, the Witch of Certainty and the strongest in the universe,
 will bring your hopeless chances of winning just a teensy bit closer to certainty.
 You better thank me.
You know, {f:5:Beatrice} may really be a cruel and powerful witch, but she\'s no match for me.
Why?
 \'Cause she\'s soft.
That kid will make the board so she can win with just a few more moves, but she deliberately won\'t finish you off.
She\'ll do stuff like take worthless pieces, or put way too many pieces on the board to make things even more one‐sided.
The point is, she\'s got this bad habit of playing around when she thinks she\'s going to win.
Almost all the various attacks that are painful for you and Bern...
look like a total waste and overkill to me.
...Basically, that\'s her weakness, and it\'s also your chance.
 See?
 She isn\'t an opponent to be afraid of, right?
She sometimes mistakes the means for the end.
And she has too much bad fun.
As a result, she makes and even exposes her own weak points.
It\'s impossible for a strongest‐ever witch like me to understand why she acts so relaxed.
Lowering her own chances of winning.
.........But, well.
That\'s why the type of witch like Bern who reads her opponent and dodges their moves has a really bad matchup with her.
 \'Cause reading her doesn\'t work.
...It\'s probably really easy for Bern to read and handle an obedient and honest type like me.
 That makes me so mad!
...Well, still, a super‐firepower type like me can easily go head‐on against a light, wide‐range barrage type like {f:5:Beatrice},
 so I guess it\'s kinda like rock‐paper‐scissors.
If I\'m paper, Beato\'s rock.
I guess Bern would be scissors.
Weeelll, maybe none of that matters anyway.
Sure, my paper loses to Bern\'s scissors,
 but if it was the way more awesome super‐paper, which is as thick as wood, it could even beat scissors, right?!
In other words, I, Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta},
 am super‐paper, and super‐thick!
 Hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho!
It looks like the color\'s come back to your face a little.
That Beato, she\'s having fun torturing some piece called Rosa.
At a glance, you\'d think she has really nasty hobbies, right?
 Wrong, though!
......She\'s just killing time, hoping you\'ll get up and come back.
It\'s a move to fire up your righteous indignation by doing something to make you hate her on purpose.
Ah man, I hate kids like that!
Well then, I\'ll go back.
Ah!
 Don\'t you tell anyone that I helped you out just a teensy bit!
I mean, it\'s not like I helped you because I wanted to save you, okay?!
I, the strongest witch in the universe, had my seat as the strongest stolen when I lost to Bern!
So it\'s like, I have to take that seat back from Bern,
 but if Bern loses to Beato here, then the position of the strongest will be moved to Beato this time, right?!
...Well, it\'d be easier to steal it back from Beato, so who cares really, but that won\'t satisfy me, you know what I mean?!
I\'m gonna be the one to defeat Bern!
And I\'ll take back my position as the strongest!
It\'s not like I\'m really helping you, okay?!
I won\'t forgive you if you make Bern cry!
