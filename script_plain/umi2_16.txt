After Genji finished taking his late meal, he went out to do the nighttime rounds inside the mansion.
He reheated the soup that Gohda had started making, and ate some random leftovers from the refrigerator.
They were all things Gohda had made himself, and were, of course, delicious.
He had half‐heartedly gone to ask Rosa and the others what they would do for dinner, but he had been yelled at by a voice telling him that they had canned food so they were fine, and the door wasn\'t even opened for him.
......So, ironically, it was the servant Genji who was able to eat the more delicious meal...
But even though all of those crimes had been committed, and many people had already met a brutal end,
 ......why was it that Genji wasn\'t afraid to do the rounds all by himself?
...Judging by his appearance as he carried out his normal tasks without a trace of fear, as though everything was normal,
 you might think that all of the horrible events that had happened today were just a dream or an illusion.
Was he taking a philosophic view, or was it simply resignation?
Genji must have considered it a virtue to systematically carry out his duty until the last moment,
 since the fate that awaited him was unavoidable.
It would probably be eternally impossible to perceive the depths of his heart, unless he told of it himself......
Because he had given the master key back to Rosa, the places he could go to were extremely limited.
All he could do was walk around the hallways, checking to make sure that the windows were closed.
So he was able to go around that route far more quickly than usual.
".......................................
 ......mgh."
After the sound of a moderate knock,
 Auntie Rosa, who had been falling into a doze shortly before, jumped and woke up, pointing the barrel of the gun at the door as she yelled.
"Who is it?!"
I was napping on a sofa, and that voice also brought me back to reality.
"......Rosa‐sama.
 It is Genji."
"Do you have some business?
 We\'ll be fine without opening the door.
 Tell us from there."
".........Yes.
 Well then, forgive me for speaking in this fashion.
 ...I have found the bodies of Doctor Nanjo and Kumasawa."
"Wh‐...what did you say...?!!"
"............I see.
 Alright, let\'s go and check them.
 ...Until I see the corpses, I won\'t believe anybody."
"....................."
"......Uu.
 It\'s alright, Battler.
 If you\'re with me, it\'ll definitely be alright."
Maybe my face was shadowed with anxiety.
...Maria grasped my hand with her small hand, and spoke softly, trying to give me courage.
Since it was Auntie Rosa\'s job to ready the gun and stand guard, it fell to me to remove the barricade of sofas.
When I finished, I took a backward glance at Auntie Rosa, who was pointing the barrel of the gun over my shoulder, and opened the door.
"Genji‐san, where are their corpses...?"
".........In the courtyard.
 I shall guide you."
"Battler‐kun, wait!
 Just in case, I\'m going to check the doors and windows of this room before we go.
 Wait a second."
Auntie Rosa called me to a halt to prevent me from going on ahead, and began to carefully check the locks on each of the windows.
......But those locks had already been checked once.
......It felt kind of unpleasant, as though she suspected that I might have secretly unlocked them when she wasn\'t looking.
...No, maybe she was right to be this cautious...
Even though it was called a courtyard, it wasn\'t really a pretty place you could take a walk in like the rose garden.
On the contrary, since it was surrounded by the mansion on all sides,
 it made you feel a little discomfort, as though it was telling you that you couldn\'t escape from the mansion even if you tried to escape to the outside.
On the other hand, thanks to that, even though the violent winds could be heard, the wind itself was blocked.
Genji‐san held out an umbrella, but Auntie Rosa ignored him.
...She probably wanted to say that the gun took two hands, so taking the umbrella would be dangerous because she wouldn\'t be able to fire the gun.
Even without Genji‐san pointing his finger, we could tell immediately.
Right in the center of the courtyard, ......we could see where Doctor Nanjo and Kumasawa‐san lay...
Auntie Rosa entered the courtyard without even an umbrella.
...So Genji‐san and I also entered the courtyard without opening one.
Only Maria had one open like normal.
"..................Maria...
 ......Is this......you know?"
"......Uu.
 ......It\'s the seventh twilight and the eighth twilight."
"I, ......I see.
 Certainly, just as Genji‐san and the others said, there are horrible wounds on their necks.
 ......Very sharp.
 Almost as though they\'ve been sliced with a katana or something..."
That gaping wound on their necks definitely made me want to avert my eyes,
 but after seeing the Halloween party in the chapel, even though I thought it was horrible, it was no longer enough to make me feel sick.
Instead, our gazes were directed to their legs.
In Doctor Nanjo\'s knee.
 In Kumasawa‐san\'s ankle.
......Driven into each of them was something like a knife or a stake with a demonic decoration.
...They would surely be the same as the one that had pierced Jessica\'s back.
"......What is this?
 ...It\'s the same as Jessica‐chan.
 Is this supposed to be some kind of occult ritual, I wonder?"
".........I do not know.
 The last time I saw their bodies, there was nothing like this.
 Maybe it was done after they were carried out of the servant room."
The one that had been stuck into Doctor Nanjo\'s knee was still standing erect,
 but the one that had been thrust into Kumasawa‐san\'s ankle might have been a little shallower.
 It had come out and fallen over.
So, it was only when I saw that one that had fallen over, that for the first time, I realized that it wasn\'t a knife,
 but something like a stake.
Its full length was probably about thirty centimeters.
It was probably made out of bronze or iron or something of the sort.
Even without touching it, I could tell that it had some weight to it.
It was composed of a grip and a cone‐shaped part, and it was obviously made to be a piercing weapon.
Maybe you could describe it like a miniature version of those lances Western knights used on horseback.
The grooves that had been carved in a spiral shape made it also look like a drill.
......However, the grip had an occult‐like design of a demon or something,
 so instead of a weapon used in war,
 it felt like something that would be used in a ritual to offer up a sacrifice.
"......There\'s no mistake.
 ...They\'re meant to be...sacrifices."
".........On the seventh twilight, gouge the knee and kill.
 On the eighth twilight, gouge the leg and kill."
"Wait.
 Then, they\'ve left out the fourth, fifth, and sixth twilights.
 ......D‐......don\'t tell me..."
That\'s right.
Why is Genji‐san alone?!
If something like this had happened, why wouldn\'t George‐aniki, Gohda‐san, or Shannon‐chan be here?!
 Why was Genji‐san alone?!
"What is this?
 Where did George‐kun and the other two go?!"
".........They told me that they wanted to go to Madam Natsuhi\'s room to search for something, and left.
 They have not returned yet."
"What did you say...?
 Umm, you say they left, when was that?!"
"Two or three hours ago, I believe."
"N‐no way...!!
 Why didn\'t you say something that important—wait, no—why didn\'t you think that was suspicious?!"
"......There must always be one servant awaiting orders.
 It was my duty to wait for orders until they returned."
Was Genji‐san really this much of a robot?!
This is bad, this is bad, it\'s really bad...!!
The fact that Doctor Nanjo and Kumasawa‐san had been killed in this way meant that three people had already been killed...!!
We ran towards Aunt Natsuhi\'s room.
.........With a touch of anxiety, and just as much resignation.
Before we even saw the inside of Aunt Natsuhi\'s room,
 ...we were imprisoned by a certain resignation.
On that door was bizarre...
graffiti—
no, filth...?
In any case, the door wasn\'t in a normal state, and we were able to imagine what was inside that room without opening it.
On the face of the door...... How should I say it?
......Someone had heavily painted their hands with the same red paint that the magic circles from before had been drawn with,
 ...and had banged on the door, scratched it, dirtied it.
......It was dirtied like the aftermath of a kindergartner playing in the mud.
I didn\'t know what it could mean.
...The bright‐red paint that had been slathered on was dripping down, and even though no one said it, it made us think of blood.
"...G‐...Genji‐san, please open it."
Auntie Rosa held her gun up high and ordered Genji‐san to open it.
Genji‐san approached the door without being particularly troubled by that stuff on it, and turned the knob,
 but he immediately turned around, shaking his head.
It was locked.
Right now, there was only one person in this mansion who could lock and unlock doors at will: Auntie Rosa.
This time, Genji‐san asked Auntie Rosa to unlock the door, instead of the other way around.
After making a slightly disgruntled face, Auntie Rosa handed me a master key, and told me to open the door.
"......Battler‐kun, would you open it for me with this?"
"Just trusting Genji‐san with something like that wouldn\'t..."
Auntie Rosa glared at me with an intense gaze.
......Getting into a fight here would only make the environment turn even more sour.
Without talking back any more, I approached that creepy door, and tried the knob.
 ......It didn\'t open.
It was definitely the resistance of the lock.
I stuck the master key into the keyhole.
Clunk.
 A light resistance.
While listening to Auntie Rosa as she told me to be cautious, I opened the door without being particularly cautious at all.
And there.........was the scene, laid out before us, not betraying our expectations in the slightest.
"...........................!
 How...horrible......"
"....................."
"As I thought, ......it was a reproduction of the fourth, fifth, and sixth twilights."
".........Uu."
The inside of the room looked as though a robber had just broken in.
Drawers were flung open, pulled out, with their contents thrown all over the floor,
 the room devastated so that it looked nothing like the room of the methodical Aunt Natsuhi.
But the thing that caught the eye before that...
......was Gohda‐san\'s body lying facedown right in front of the door...
One of those demon stakes had been rammed right into the center of his chest, almost as though it had been stuck there to finish off a vampire.
......Exactly how far would it have reached after being stuck that deeply into his chest?
...My own chest hurt just imagining it.
"...Gouge the chest was the fifth twilight?"
"............Uu."
Maria grabbed my hand.
......Her expression looked just like normal,
 ...but maybe she really was afraid of the aura in this room where three bodies lay.
And, along the wall farthest into the room, George‐aniki was dead.
......This time, one of those stakes had been rammed right in the center of his stomach.
...Gouging the stomach was the sixth twilight, I think.
Shannon‐chan\'s body was face down over the front of the dresser, lying in a sea of blood.
In its horribly broken mirror, sprayed with blood, had she seen her final worldly expression?
...Because she was face down, I couldn\'t see her face, but I could imagine even without seeing it.
Nearby, in the sea of blood she lay in, a demon\'s stake had fallen...
......Only the fourth twilight was left.
Gouge the head and kill...
Maybe my heart was completely tired out and dead...
Even though I knew what I was doing was wrong, ...I lifted her head, and checked.
......And confirmed that my guess was right on the mark.
There was a gaping hole in Shannon‐chan\'s forehead, and her insides were dripping out.
Not only that, ...you could even see...inside her.
After seeing that, I finally noticed that what I was doing was wrong.
I immediately averted my eyes, but by now, it was probably pointless.
"Hey, Battler‐kun!!
 We have to leave everything alone until the police come!!
 What do you think you\'re doing, touching it?!
 What will you do if our precious evidence from the crime scene gets disturbed?!!"
Auntie Rosa yelled furiously at me, and even yanked the back of my collar.
I tottered limply and fell on my butt, ......and gazed dimly up at the ceiling...
"......Maria."
"Uu......?"
"......Now even the eighth twilight is over.
 ......What was the ninth twilight again?"
"...........................
 ...On the ninth twilight, the witch revives, and none shall be left alive."
"I see.
 ......So now, the Golden Witch BEATRICE will be revived.
 ......What then?
 ...On the final tenth twilight?"
"...On the tenth twilight, the journey ends, and you shall reach the Home of the Gold.
 .........Very soon, the door to the Golden Land will be opened.
 ...Very soon."
".........The witch revives, and none shall be left alive, you say.
 .........We\'re going to die?
 Or is the sacrificial ritual over now, ...and our journey will end, and we can make it to the Golden Land...?"
"................................."
"......Our journey, yeah right.
 ......We\'ve spent the whole day trying to find the culprit, racking our brains as we tried to break out of this situation,
 ...and we haven\'t gotten anywhere.
 It\'s like they say—thinking stupid is no better than sleeping."
"That\'s right, we\'ve spent the whole day burning ourselves up with hatred and paranoia.
 ......We said we could only trust dead people,
 ...and we came all the way here just to check out their dead faces...
 ...If we\'re like this,
 ......how...
......can you say we can make it to the Golden Land......"
That\'s right... ......If nothing could be solved, it would have been much better if we had locked ourselves up the whole time without thinking at all.
Grandfather was the wisest of us.
He\'s been shut up in his room since yesterday, without any contact with anyone.
......That would have been fine.
Grandfather was the most correct...
"......It\'ll be alright, Battler.
 ......If you\'re with me, it\'ll be alright.
 .........Witches are very fickle, and they\'re terrifying beings who maybe kill humans for fun sometimes."
"...But, if you\'re together with me, it\'ll definitely be alright.
 So, don\'t be afraid."
".........Thank you.
 ......Even if that\'s just to comfort me, ...it makes me happy."
After Auntie Rosa finished investigating their deaths, she proclaimed that she would seal this room again,
 chased the rest of us out, stole back the master key she had lent me, and locked the door again.
It seemed that George‐aniki had been holding the original key to Aunt Natsuhi\'s room.
 She had also collected that.
............Wait a second.
She had all of the master keys in her hand.
And if the original key had been shut up inside that room,
 ......wasn\'t this another locked room?
So this is a fourth locked room......?
Now that we had been released from our suspicion of those three, ......we once again returned to the parlor.
I don\'t have a clue what\'s going on anymore.
......If only the dead are safe, and everyone alive is a wolf,
 ......then all that\'s left is me, Auntie Rosa, Maria, and Genji‐san.
......Only those, Grandfather, and that 19th person—the guest who I hadn\'t even sensed— BEATRICE.
Thirteen people had died, and six were left.
 ......With only six people, how would the wolves and sheep puzzle end...?
 Even though the puzzle which had had nineteen people in it had been reduced to a mere six,
 ......I couldn\'t find any answer...
We returned to the parlor.
......I felt a little anxious that, while we were gone,
 a creepy magic circle or something might have been drawn on the door to the parlor,
 but thankfully, there was none...
"Thank you, Genji‐san.
 This is far enough.
 Please rest for the day."
"......Certainly.
 ...Then, if you will allow me to rest."
"H‐...hey, Auntie Rosa...
 ......Are you saying that you\'ll leave Genji‐san all alone in a situation like this...?"
"......You are right.
 I do think it\'s very dangerous."
"......But, in that case, why is he safe?
 After those three headed to Natsuhi nee‐san\'s room, he was alone the whole time.
 And yet he\'s safe."
"......It\'s the wolves and sheep puzzle.
 Why would an isolated sheep—a sheep in its weakest position—be safe?"
"...P‐......probably because, by coincidence, there weren\'t any wolves..."
"Wrong.
 Because it wasn\'t a sheep."
"Are you saying Genji‐san\'s...a wolf...?"
"He said that he was alone in the kitchen, but that\'s impossible to prove.
 The only ones who could have carried Doctor Nanjo and Kumasawa‐san\'s corpses, and who could have killed George and the rest, were him and BEATRICE, right?"
"W‐wait, with that argument, anyone—"
"......Battler‐sama.
 Thank you for your concern."
"...I believe that trust will be won not with a hundred excuses, but with a single unending faithfulness.
 ......Even if I am not able to gain your trust, I wish to be faithful until the end."
".....................Genji‐san..."
"......Then it\'s settled.
 ......If you are truly innocent, the police will prove that for us when they come tomorrow.
 So, until then, we cannot remove you from suspicion."
".........After your long years of service to the Ushiromiya family, I find it truly painful to treat you so poorly.
 ...But please understand for tonight.
 ...Then, when tomorrow comes, please let me make up with you again."
Genji‐san gave his head a small shake.
"......Whether today or tomorrow,
 I will continue to be a servant of the Ushiromiya family.
 ......If you have any business, please say so at any time.
 ......Then, if you will excuse me."
After hearing all that, there was nothing left to say.
Genji‐san bowed deeply, and left down the hall...
And we entered the room.
...Even though Auntie Rosa still held all of the master keys herself, she began another thorough check of the inside of the parlor.
She opened the curtains, and checked again to make sure the windows were locked.
As I watched, ......how should I say it, I felt like it didn\'t really matter anymore.
If I said anything unnecessary, it would turn into another fight.
For a while, I gazed at her from the corridor, figured I had waited just about long enough, and entered the parlor behind her.
......If she can\'t trust anyone but the dead, she should just go around killing everyone with the gun she\'s got in her hand.
And then in the end, she\'ll realize that she herself was the wolf.
...And then she can blast through the head of the final wolf, and the curtain will close on this insane murder theater...
As I thought that bitterly, I returned to the sofa where I had been encamped before,
 and rudely rested both of my feet on the table...
......Or was about to, when I found something there and stopped my feet.
"........................
 .........What is...this...?"
Right there, almost as though it was addressed to me, ...was a Western envelope.
It was that envelope from before, with the seal of the One‐winged Eagle.
...And it was unopened.
W‐
.........wait wait wait wait...
...What is...this............?
When, who, put it in a place like this......?
I had been sitting here the whole time, until I went with everyone to check the corpses.
And there hadn\'t been anything.
...And when I returned,
 it was...
here.
"......It\'s alright.
 There was no problem with the locks on the windows.
 This room is safe."
I heard Rosa muttering that...
......Wait wait wait wait.
...Wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait.
We had made sure this room was safe when we exited it.
We had checked that the windows were all perfectly locked.
...And we had locked it, come back, and the windows were still locked.
......Then, wait, who had put this letter here and how......
I opened the letter.
Two pieces of stationery came out.
The first page......had a magic circle drawn on it, in something like blood.
If I asked Maria, she\'d probably know what it meant.
And there was writing on the other page.
― Are you making progress solving the riddle of the epitaph?
Very, very soon, you\'ll run flat out of time.
The ninth twilight will start very soon.
......There was no mistake.
...It was a letter...from BEATRICE...
"...Uu?
 ......Battler,
 ......what is that?"
"Ah, ......right.
 When I came here just now,
 ...i‐it was just placed here."
"What happened, Maria?
 .........Huh?!
 Battler‐kun, that letter?!"
"W‐wait, err!
 It was just placed here.
 Why?!
 Even though we properly checked to make sure this room was closed!!
 Why?!
 Why!!"
".................................
 ......Maria, come here."
Auntie Rosa closed her eyes just a little, and after silently thinking something, told Maria to come.
Maria obeyed her mother\'s words.
As she did, something unbelievable happened.
Auntie Rosa pointed the barrel of that gun at me...
"Battler‐kun, I\'ve concluded that you are a "wolf"."
"Wh‐.........why?!?!"
"When I came into the room just now, I saw that there was nothing at all on the table.
 ...And I know that Maria did not approach that table.
 ...It was for a short time.
 But the only one who approached the table, and claimed to have found the letter, is you."
"How can you,
 ............wait, tha‐that\'s all screwed up!!
 Why would I put something like this here?!
 Wait wait, I just found something suspicious and reported it, right?!
 Why are you suspecting me?!"
"Because only you could set that letter there!!
 That\'s right, this is all a charade!!
 You pulled an envelope from your pocket, and then acted as though you had just found it.
 To create the illusion that the witch entered a locked room, set down a letter, and left!!"
"...............You dumbass...
 Are you thinking like that a‐......again...?
 Because of something like that,
 ......you\'re going to suspect me?!"
"Cut that out!!
 My family has been killed!!
 Why would I of all people take part in the culprit\'s scheme?!!"
"Yes.
 Even under the assumption you could receive a large amount of money, I don\'t want to believe a demon exists who would sell their own parents."
"But, ...maybe he does.
 No, that\'s a bad way to say it.
 ......What if, in your eyes, Battler‐kun, Rudolf nii‐san and Kyrie‐san weren\'t your parents?"
"...Wh‐......whaaa?!?!
 Think about what you\'re saying!!"
"Dad is Dad!!
 Sure I\'m not related to Kyrie‐san by blood, but she\'s like a big sister to me!!
 Don\'t you dare say otherwise, you bastard!!"
"Uu‐uu‐uu!!
 Stoooppp iiiiit!!
 Uu‐uu‐uu!!"
"Stop saying "uu‐uu"!!"
"......I\'m sorry, that was a bad way to say it.
 Of course, Ushiromiya Battler‐kun might be Rudolf nii‐san\'s child!"
"......But, are you really Battler‐kun, the son of Rudolf nii‐san?!"
"What the hell are you talking about?!!
 If I\'m not Battler, then who else do I look like?!"
"All of us, including Rudolf nii‐san, reunited with you after a six‐year gap.
 No one can prove that you really are Ushiromiya Battler, right?!"
"Maybe you aren\'t really Ushiromiya Battler, but someone who\'s snuck in, trying to skillfully steal the wealth of the Ushiromiya family!!
 Can you clearly prove that you are Ushiromiya Battler?!
 Right here, right now!!!"
"Cut it out, damn it!!
 I am me!
 Ushiromiya Battler!!
 If we\'re going to doubt even that much, are you really Ushiromiya Rosa?!
 I\'m myself, no one else!!
 Yeah, that\'s right, it\'s just as you say, the only one you can trust other than corpses is yourself!!!"
"If you\'re going to say that much, it\'s time I argued back!"
"The door to Aunt Natsuhi\'s room, where George‐aniki and the others died, was locked!
 George‐aniki was holding the key to that room, right?!
 And by now, the only one holding a master key is you!
 Weren\'t you the only one who could have locked that room?!?!"
"My reasoning goes like this.
 You\'re in contact with the real culprit,
 and while I wasn\'t looking, you lent them one of the five master keys!!"
"I wouldn\'t do that!!
 See, there are five of them here, right?!"
"As if that matters!!
 You could have had them set it in a pre‐arranged spot and then collected it back!!
 And weren\'t you the one who said it was suspicious whether there really are five master keys?!"
"So how are you saying that someone other than yourself set that letter there?!!
 As long as you can\'t prove that, you are a wolf!!"
"Shut uuuuuup!!
 Then why don\'t you show me some proof,
 how do you say the culprit killed George‐aniki and the rest in that locked room?!
 How did they lock it?!!"
"Absolutely and totally correct!
Natsuhi\'s room was exactly the same, just like usual!
The door and the windows were locked from the inside."
"
There were no frauds or tricks, no means of secret passage nor places in which to hide!
Natsuhi\'s own key was in George\'s pocket, and locked inside the room.
That leaves only the five master keys, and "Rosa" was holding all of them!"
"
And while I\'m at it, the parlor is the same.
The key to the parlor itself is sealed away in the servant room.
So unlocking it with anything but a master key is impossible! 
The locked‐room definition of the room is the same as always!"
"Come onnnnn, there\'s only one suspect noooooooooow,
 or are you still playing dumb, Ushiromiya Battleeeeeeeeeeeeeer?!"
"Shut uuuuuuup!!
 You keep silent as welllllllllllllllllll!!!"
"You\'re the one who should keep silent, how do you say that letter was set there by someone other than you?!
 As long as you can\'t prove that, you\'re a wolf!!"
"If I can be suspected, then you can be suspected, you try showing me some proof,
 weren\'t you the first to enter the room and begin checking the windows?!"
"Then you anticipated that I\'d return to where I\'d been sitting before, and secretly placed the letter.
 I can also suspect that this is your trap, can\'t I?!"
"Why would I use a trap like that?!!
 If I was a wolf, I\'d shoot you with this gun without question!!"
"That\'s no reason!!
 Maybe, because you couldn\'t commit murder in front of Maria, you chose the roundabout way of setting a clever trap!!"
"All of the master keys are in your hands!
 So this place and the room just a while ago, are all your doing, aren\'t they?!!
 If you can talk your way out of this, then let me hear your excuse!!"
"That\'s right, you\'ve been suspicious from the start!
 Why is it that six of the adults in the family conference were killed, and you were the only exception?
 Why were you the only one not in that chapel?!"
"There can only be one reason, you called Dad and the rest out there and killed them!!
 Damn it, damn it,
 that explains everything, doesn\'t it, don\'t fuck with me don\'t fuck with me,
 stop saying things that don\'t make seeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeense!!"
"Uuuuu!!
 Stooppppp iiiiiiiiit!!
 You mustn\'t fiiiight!!"
"Mama too, Battler too, stop iiiiiiiiiiit, stop iiiiiiiiiiiiit!!!
 It\'s no one\'s fault!
 It\'s not Battler\'s or Mama\'s fault!!
 The witch did all of this!
 She did it with magic!!
 It\'s no one\'s faaaaaaaaaault!!
 Uu‐uuuu!!"
Maria thrust herself in between me and Auntie Rosa, both of us incensed.
I was taken aback by Maria\'s crying voice and returned to my senses.
...At that instant, I became filled with shame.
Tears flowed from my eyes.
"......That\'s right...
 ......It\'s all...
......the witch\'s fault, isn\'t it......!!
 All this about keys and tricks and alibis......
all of it, all of it was stupid!!"
"Even though it\'s the work of the witch, we weren\'t even able to trust each other as fellow humans...!!
 Right, Auntie Rosa? From the beginning, there wasn\'t a Human culprit, it was all the work of the witch."
"So there\'s no way you\'re the culprit,
 and there\'s no way I\'m the culprit, or Maria, or Genji‐san, or aaaaaanyone!!
 Why has it come to this?!!"
"Why am I screaming with Auntie Rosa, ......who I loved?!
 Why am I having this fight...
...with the kind aunt who I loved?!"
"Why, why does everyone have to suspect each other?!?!
 I\'m not going to doubt my auntie, I\'m not going to doubt anyone,
 it\'s all the work of the witch, it\'s all the work of BEATRICE,
 it\'s all, all a crime that BEATRICE committed with magic!!"
"BEATRICEEEEEE, please, show yourself here,
 and confess to us that you did everything,
 I\'ve had enough already, I\'ve had enough of doubting each other like this!!"
"So forgive us,
 release us,
 release us from this hell of suspecting each other until we see each other\'s deaths!!
 Give me my kind relatives and cousins back!!
 I hate it, I hate it, I hate it all!!
 You definitely exist, you win!!"
"Show yourself, ooooooooooooooooooohhh, BEATRICEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!
 BEATRIIIIICEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!"
".........Am I...............still...alive?"
Kinzo seemed to have fallen into a doze at some point.
He searched for his spectacles, and looked at the clock.
......It was 10 p.m.
"...Her ritual, I wonder, how far has it progressed?
 ............It must have progressed quite far by this time."
Kinzo lifted his heavy body from the chair, ......and approached the portrait of the witch that he had gazed at every day.
".........BEATRICE.
 Very soon, ......I will be able to be reunited with your smile.
 ............It doesn\'t matter if I die!
 If I could just see your smile once more, I would gladly give this life of mine!"
"So,
 ...I beg youuuu, let me...
...meet with you one more tiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiime...
 And let me swear my love to you, let me apologize for my crimes, uuuoooooooooooo......"
"......But I won\'t let you escape!!
 You are mine!!
 From your hair to the tips of your toes, to the dirt under your nails, you are mine!!
 Every fragment of your flesh is mine, even the broth of your corpse is mine!!"
"I won\'t let you escape, this time you won\'t spill from my hands!!
 I\'ll make you mine for all eternity!!!
 I will never let you escape a second time,
 I will never let you escape a second time!!"
Kinzo howled in rage, then suddenly fell to his knees, ...as he shook and scraped at the wall...
 ...In an instant, he had started sobbing.
"............uuuuuu, hic...,
 that\'s wrong,
 that\'s not what I wanted to sayyy, BEATRICEEEEEE..."
"Please,
 ......let me meet you one more time...
 Even if you only let me apologize......
 Uuuuuuuuu, BEATRICEEEEEE,
 ...hic, ...hic...! Uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaauaauauau...!!"
"You are beloved, yearned for...! I was wrong...!
 If you would just smile, I wouldn\'t need anything else...
 I made a mistake, I got it wrong,
 ......I did something that cannot be taken back...!"
"In atonement, I have offered the whole remainder of my life...!!
 In order to apologize to you, in order to atone for my sins,
 .........I have...
...offered everything.........
 ......Please, even if it is as I die..."
"............At least...
............let me...
say one word...
...of apology...y......
 BEATRICEEEEEEE......
 Uuuuuu, hic, uuuuuuuu, uuuuuuuuuuuuu!"
......As Kinzo shook and cried, behind his small back, a butterfly appeared out of nowhere, like a flake of gold leaf, and softly fell down...
...You fool, Kinzo.
Do you think a woman exists who would fall for a man\'s tears.........?
Well, ......even if it wouldn\'t make a Human woman fall for you, ...it might for a woman who is not Human.
Kinzo.
 Do you remember......?
The board position of our chess game, which we never finished......?
Kinzo, as though he had suddenly remembered something, approached the chess set.
 The game he had been playing with Nanjo until yesterday remained there still.
...He wiped the pieces from the chessboard with a wide sweeping motion, and began to line them up again one by one.
 ...It was the setup for a game in progress.
".........That\'s right. Like this.
 ............I advanced my queen.
 ...That was a very spectacular move.
 It might have been a little too intense for you.
 .........I deliberated whether you would throw away your piece or not,
 ......deliberated and deliberated............"
Kinzo waited, with the opposite seat empty.
......Surely, very soon, his opponent would appear there,
 ......and he would be able to restart this game again...
...You fool, Kinzo.
You want to apologize?
 You want to see my face again?
 You want to make my smile an eternal thing?
Why can\'t you say a much, much simpler word?
 Even though that is the single element of the world.........
At that time, Kinzo muttered.
......A prayer?
 An entreaty?
.........It was probably best to just call it muttering.
"......I.........love you...
 ......BEATRICE..............."
They were pure words, like something an innocent child would say, without any evil intent...
...You really are a fool, Kinzo.
If you ever have the chance to do your life over again...
...know that those words could never cause a woman to fall for you.
Yes, ...not without a miracle.
So this.........
Just then.
 .........Kinzo definitely heard a small knock, with a different tempo than those of the servants.........
".........Who is it?"
The woman beyond the door......didn\'t answer.
"......I\'m asking who you are!!
 Will you not answer?!!"
The woman beyond the door...
...didn\'t answer.
"Could it be...
 ............Oooooh,
 ......could it be......
 B‐
......BEATRICE?"
".........BEATRICE,
 .........BEATRICEEEEEEEEE!!"
The woman beyond the door......answered.
On the ninth twilight, the witch revives, and none shall be left alive.
