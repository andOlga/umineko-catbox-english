I saw a figure, apparently the driver, open an umbrella and come towards me...
".........Is this your garden?"
The figure questioned me.
Of course, I couldn\'t answer it...
"......If it is, then I must apologize.
 Yes, on a day with such fine weather, anyone would want to take a nap in such a lovely garden as this.
 ......And yet, unless my memory fails me..."
The figure crouched down and looked into my face.
 .........It was a woman.
"This is a public highway you\'re sleeping on.
 Do you want to become roadkill?
 ......Or maybe you already are roadkill.
 Well now, which one is it?"
I......clenched my chest.
I felt I needed to answer somehow and establish communication.
So, after a lot of effort, ......I managed to let a short groan escape my lips.
"......I see.
 So you aren\'t roadkill yet."
And that.........was how I met Ikuko.
"......The body is in a very frail condition.
 Also, it is probable that there will be memory defects.
 We won\'t know for sure until the CT scan, but brain damage is also a possibility."
"It\'s lucky that damage is all we have to deal with.
 Spend much longer in a spot like that, and things would likely have been much worse."
"......True.
 In any event, I recommend getting this checked at a large hospital."
"Thank you, Doctor.
 .........Please keep this off the record.
 It may not be much, but here\'s some money for your troubles."
"I see no reason to speak of this needlessly, but...
 ......No, no, I couldn\'t possibly accept that much..."
In the end, the doctor took the money and swore to keep quiet about the matter.
Eventually, Hachijo returned.
"Oh, you\'ve been awake.
 How do you feel...?"
I nodded weakly, letting her know that it wasn\'t so bad for now.
......But...where is this place?
A room I have absolutely no memory of, ......in a house I don\'t remember at all.
And, first and foremost, here\'s a woman that I\'ve never seen......
"To start off, let me introduce myself.
 I\'m Hachijo Ikuko.
 I don\'t mind if you address me in a friendly manner as Ikuko, or if you prefer to call me Hachijo‐san and keep things more formal."
......Hachijo.........Ikuko.
"The Hachijo family owns a lot of land and is well known in these parts.
 ......Unlike my accomplished brothers, I\'m what you might call a little eccentric.
 After I got into a bit too much mischief than was good for me, my parents finally ran out of patience and kicked me out.
 I\'m now confined to this house."
"......As a hobby, I like to read detective novels...and also to write them.
 My age...is a single woman\'s secret.
 My heart is that of a girl, but I\'m approaching the point where calling myself one would be increasingly absurd.
 Heheheheh."
With the haze my mind was in, it was extremely hard to make out what she was talking about.
However, ......I was able to pick up on the fact...that she was trying to talk to me cheerfully.
"......So, what\'s your name?"
..................My......name......
..............................
Logically, I know that, being a human, I must have a name.
And, I do have the feeling that I did indeed have a name.
......However, no matter how hard I tried to remember what it was, it just made my head hurt...
"Is there anything you can remember besides your name...?"
".........................................."
Who......am I......?
My head...
...no, even my heart was a mess of torn flesh,
 ......and I couldn\'t remember a thing, ......not even who or what I was...
But I must remember.
I had some kind of purpose......or maybe a mission.
In order to remember that, .........I first have to remember who I am.
Who am I......?
 What is my name......?
 Where was I born......and what was my birthday......?
I need to remember something, anything............
.......................................
"...............Age......"
"Age?
 *giggle*.
 That\'s my little secret."
".........Eighteen..."
"I look like I\'m eighteen...?!"
"......I\'m............eighteen............"
"O‐oh, so that was your age...!
 Well now, I thought you were being a bit too flattering.
 Hahahaha."
When I asked myself how old I was, the number "eighteen" floated into my mind.
To be honest, I didn\'t really feel eighteen.
......My mind felt much younger than that, ......and my pathetic body felt much older.
"I see.
 So you\'re eighteen.
 And that\'s all you can remember."
I nodded weakly.
I never knew that knowing nothing about yourself could make you feel so powerless.
"In that case, until you remember your name,
 let\'s give you the name "Tohya", written with the characters for "eighteen".
 ......Hachijo Tohya.
 What do you think?
 Yeah, that sounds pretty cool.
 Yes, I must say I\'ve impressed myself very much with that one."
Hachijo......Ikuko gave a satisfied laugh.
From then on, I took the name Hachijo Tohya.
My inability to move my body was apparently due to a traffic accident.
On that day, I had been hit by a car, and Ikuko had picked me up from where I lay on the street.
If she hadn\'t hit the brakes...
She probably would\'ve driven straight onwards, thinking she\'d run over a dead dog or something.
......Later on, I—perhaps rudely—suspected that the one who hit me might have been Ikuko herself,
 but when I saw her completely undamaged front bumper, I gave up on that theory.
Hachijo Ikuko lived in a small but lovely mansion on the top of a small hill, in a village with a view of the sea.
She also owned the hill behind her and was more than capable of enjoying the four seasons in privacy.
As time passed slowly, my rehabilitation continued, and my ability to move improved little by little.
However, ......it seemed I really had suffered some form of brain damage.
Finding out who I was.........looked like it would be a very difficult task.
In the beginning, when I couldn\'t bear not knowing my identity, my head often hurt so much it felt as though it would explode.
......However, as I slowly accepted the fact that I was a new person, with the new name of Hachijo Tohya,
 ......the headaches became less frequent.
The whole time, ......no memories returned to me except the fact that I had been eighteen.
However, I was unable to remember any more, unable even to be sure that eighteen was my true age,
 ......and eventually, I stopped trying to remember my former self.
"Good morning, Tohya.
 That was quite the storm last night. Were you able to sleep well?"
".........I had some trouble falling asleep.
 So, I decided to read your manuscript."
"My, my.
 How far did you manage to get?"
"I finished it."
"......Now there\'s a surprise.
 You managed to read through all that in a single night?"
"I was surprised too.
 ......Once I got into it, I\'d finished before I knew it.
 ......It was like I was just skimming it, ......or maybe like I was reading each page in a glance......"
"It sounds like you have some talent at speed reading.
 ......So, how was it?
 What did you think of it?"
"I liked it a lot.
 Still, if you don\'t explain that part about the ocean currents a bit more clearly, it might be a little unfair for the reader...
 Oh, but I thought it was great that you had the foreshadowing with the ring right there at the beginning."
".........After I finished, I had to go back to the beginning and slap myself for being so easily tricked.
 I think that feeling\'s the best part of a detective novel."
"...................................."
"......Um, ......did I say something to offend you?
 ......If I did, I apologize."
"Of course not! Why are you apologizing...?!
 I\'m just shocked, that\'s all.
 The pertinence of your remarks is commendable...
 It seems you must also have some talent as a critic or a detective novel writer."
...............A detective novel...writer.
 ......A critic.
........................
From across the fog of oblivion...
...I seem to remember myself fighting and arguing about......mysteries, ......or something like that.
That way of fighting, which I must have learned in the past.........sent a surge of excitement through me.
......Mystery.
 ......Fighting......
 My head......hurt.........
I accepted a painkiller and swallowed it with fresh water brought up from the well.
Who am I......really.........?
......But no matter how much I thought, I couldn\'t remember.
I was told that the frequency of my headaches could be lessened by brain surgery, but also that there was no guarantee that it would do my memory any good.
Ikuko said that she would let me have surgery if I wanted it.
However, I refused.
Even if I can\'t remember it, ......the real me is still there, sleeping inside my head.
I was scared......that the surgery might harm that "me" somehow.
By now, I\'ve gotten used to dealing with headaches.
......As long as I don\'t force myself to remember the past, the headaches don\'t torment me every day.
So, ......bit by bit, I became free of the headaches...and got used to my new life as Hachijo Tohya......
Gradually, my interest shifted from myself to Ikuko.
Hachijo Ikuko.
A very strange woman.
First off, she was apparently the daughter of a very well‐off family, just as she had said.
However, she was considerably eccentric,
 and the "various mischievous incidents" she spoke of had apparently gotten her within an inch of being disowned.
As a result, she had been given this house, and had been ordered to live here quietly and alone.
She had never been a particularly social person, so she happily accepted this new state of affairs,
 living however she pleased with servants to take care of her.
She had no friends.
 No one ever came to visit.
Besides me, the only one she ever talked to was Bern, an old black cat she kept as a pet.
I didn\'t know her real age.
She didn\'t seem to be too old to marry yet, but she wasn\'t likely to meet anyone new leading an isolated life like this.
Despite her insistence that she just hadn\'t met anyone worth the trouble, I felt as though she\'d already given up on marriage.
Her everyday life changed very little.
She would either read through the many detective novels that were brought to her, or else write detective novels herself.
At first, I thought she was some novelist at a private retreat, plugging away at a new book.
However, the manuscripts she finished just ended up clipped together in a pile.
With me as the sole exception, it didn\'t look like she gave them to anyone else to read.
A novelist is someone who writes novels for other people to read.
So, I figured you could hardly call her a novelist when she kept writing novels no one would ever read.
"......Ikuko‐san, why don\'t you ever show these to anyone?"
"I show them to you.
 Only the better ones, of course."
"Haven\'t you ever thought of sending one to some publishing company?
 ......It\'s a shame for things to be this way, when your works are so interesting."
"My works can\'t stand up against the pros.
 I sent one in once, but it was absolutely no good.
 I understand my position.
 This is just an amateur\'s pastime."
"I don\'t think "amateur" is a fitting word for someone who\'s so well‐versed in detective novels from all times and places across the world."
"Being a big eater doesn\'t mean you\'ll make a good cook.
 Reading every detective novel you can get your hands on provides no guarantee of being a good detective novelist.
 That\'s how it is.
 That\'s why this is nothing more than a pastime."
"......Is it really fun to write novels that you won\'t show to anyone?"
"It used to be.
 ......Once."
"What about now?"
"I like getting to hear your opinions.
 .........At any rate, I\'ve finished writing the chapter.
 I\'ll go make some tea, so would you mind reading it again and sharing your thoughts with me?"
Saying this with a smile, Ikuko thrust a pile of manuscript paper at me.
When it comes to detective novels, reading and writing are the same.
It\'s boring if you just do it by yourself.
You only get something really precious when you share the world with someone else.
........................Headache.
"Tohya?
 ......Are you okay?
 I\'ll go get some headache medicine."
"I\'m fine.
 I\'m more interested in this manuscript.
 I can\'t wait for the new chapter."
The seasons passed.
Together with Ikuko, in this town whose name I didn\'t even know,
 I spent my days debating detective novels and talking about ideas for new plots.
At a glance, they may have appeared to be stale and unproductive days.
However, ......I found satisfaction with my new life as Hachijo Tohya.
"......And so, the curtain closes on the strange tale of Kurokubi Island.
 .........The End."
With a dramatic flourish of her fountain pen, Ikuko signified that her manuscript was now complete.
"What do you think...?!
 I tried using your plot to make Tsujiko\'s tragic love scene at the end a bit more moving."
"I think it\'s very good......
 I think the last farewell is sad enough to make it moving as a story, not just a reasoning puzzle."
"......That\'s thanks to your plot.
 ......Compared to this work, everything I\'ve written before now is worth little more than scrap paper.
 ......Even as I was writing it, I was excited to be the first person in the world who got to read it.
 ......I\'ve never felt that before."
"I just mentioned some ideas.
 You\'re the one who turned them into such a fascinating story, Ikuko‐san."
Before I knew it, she had roped me in as well, and I too had dipped my toe into the world of detective novel writing.
......Apparently, the old me had possessed some knowledge of mysteries and detective novels and the like.
And my talent seemed to be of a fairly unorthodox kind.
I turned famous mysteries from across the world on their head, always looking to twist those ideas into something new.
However, a few ideas aren\'t enough to make a book.
No meal is complete if all you can do is chop up vegetables.
It was thanks to Ikuko\'s writing, a skill she had built up over many years, that my ideas were transformed into a work of fiction.
This first work that we had authored together, "The Strange Tale of Kurokubi Island", had brought out the best of our individual quirks,
 ......and, though I hate to brag, it had turned into a masterpiece that we could show to anyone without shame.
"Hello?
 Please bring us some champagne.
 ......Bring a glass for yourself as well.
 This is the best work ever created within these walls.
 Let\'s celebrate."
Ikuko called for some champagne over the internal phone line.
Joined by the servant who happened to be working that day and the cat Bern, we raised our glasses high and toasted our accomplishment.
".........Ikuko‐san.
 I have an idea, if you don\'t mind."
"Let\'s hear it.
 There is never a wrong time for your ideas, as long as I\'m not in the shower or on the can...!"
"Why don\'t we try submitting our book?
 ......I\'ve never read something this interesting before.
 I\'m sure lots of other people will want to read it."
"......You think so?
 I tried once in the past, thinking the same thing, but the result was......"
"I believe in your talent, Ikuko‐san.
 ......What about you?"
"Of course, I believe in your talent."
"Then it\'s decided.
 ......To Ikuko‐san\'s big debut."
"To Tohya\'s big debut!"
We clinked our glasses once more.
The evening wore on.........
We must\'ve had way too much to drink.
Before I knew it, I must have passed out on the sofa.
There was a blanket covering me.
 ......Ikuko‐san must\'ve put it there.
The lights were out in the study, but it wasn\'t dark.
The computer\'s monitor was glowing.
Outside, it had started to rain.
......It reminded me of the day Ikuko‐san found me and took me in.
Because of that, ......whenever it rains, I find myself wondering who I was, ......and I usually get headaches.
So, I wasn\'t sure whether the pain was because of the rain or because I drank too much.
"......Ikuko‐san.
 Turn on the lights.
 ......Using a computer in the dark is bad for your eyes."
"Oh, did I wake you up?"
"No, I slept well.
 Thanks to that, I feel refreshed."
I turned on the light and looked out through a gap in the curtains.
......As I\'d thought, it was the sort of pouring rain that always reminded me of that day.
"It\'s raining pretty hard out there.
 The wind looks pretty strong too.
 I hope the rain gutters don\'t get clogged with leaves again."
"......I just had them cleaned the other day, so they should be fine for a while."
Her answer sounded a little abstracted.
Apparently, her attention was absorbed by the computer.
"You\'ve been pretty hooked by that computer lately, Ikuko‐san.
 Did you find an interesting article or something?"
".........It may be a bit juvenile, but it\'s still pretty interesting.
 ......You know, that Rokkenjima incident."
"......Rokkenjima.........?"
"I told you about the Rokkenjima mystery a few days ago, remember?
 It\'s been really huge on the net lately.
 The discussions, theories, and especially the Forgeries have been quite entertaining.
 ......The "Forgeries" are stories with the premise that further message bottles signed by Ushiromiya Maria existed and washed up on one of the nearby islands......"
Only too happy to share her knowledge of the subject, Ikuko continued her explanation at length.
......However, ......a huge bell was clanging inside my head.
The noise was so great that I thought my head would split open.
Unable to tell what was the floor and what was the ceiling, ......I crumpled and clutched at my head...
"Tohya......are you okay...?!"
"......My head.........hurts....................."
The Rokkenjima Explosion Accident.
The many disquieting rumors surrounding it.
The scheming of the relatives after Ushiromiya Kinzo\'s vast wealth and the hidden gold......
And the truth?
Ushiromiya Eva, the sole survivor, said nothing.
Eventually, the granddaughter, Ushiromiya Ange, who escaped harm because she was absent on that day, would inherit everything......
Ange, ......Ange... ............Ushiromiya...Ange............
......I am...Ushiromiya...............
 Ggghh......
No good...my head is......splitting......
An incomprehensible scene pierced my eyelids from the inside like a blade of light.
Just what......am I looking at......?
Who......are these people......calling to me.........but not by the name Tohya...?
......Who............am I.........?
 Who are these people......?
 What is............this memory.........?
Help me, Ikuko.........
 .........Someone else\'s memory............is hurting me.........
My...head\'s......splitting.....................
{a:c:......I can hear the sorrowful sound of wind......
And......that must be rain.
......Who......am I, again...?
I am......Ushiromiya......}
{a:c:
"Ange! ......Ange...!!"}
{a:c:
"Please, please say something...!!"}
{a:c:Voices...
 Voices calling to me}.
{a:c:Dad......and Mom......}
{a:c:......It can\'t be them......}
{a:c:In 1986, ......on Rokkenjima,......Mom and Dad......}
"......Ange, hang in there...!
 Can you hear Daddy\'s voice...?!"
"Please, say something!! Ange!!"
......Mom, Dad......
I\'ll......say it out loud......
.........Mom......Dad.........
"Ange...!!
 Ange, thank goodness......!!"
I could feel my body being lifted up firmly......and hugged roughly.
......Mom and Dad......were hugging me......
My eyelids had been open for a while now.
I could feel the light slowly returning to my eyes.
Just like your eyes get used to the dark, ......my eyes got used to the light, ......and bit by bit, the scene around me came into view.
However, it was an unusual sight, which seemed to be very far away.
My body......was being hugged by Mom and Dad.
Dad was sniffling, his face covered with tears.
There were tears in Mom\'s eyes too as she hugged me tight.
It was......so strong that it hurt a bit.
I was......the bad kid, who wasn\'t obedient, who always had an excuse, ......and who always tried to do the opposite of what her parents said.
 .........That was why......they were holding me tight, .........to make sure I didn\'t head down the wrong path......
As my eyes adjusted, I could see other people besides my parents.
Everyone was there.
 George onii‐chan, Jessica onee‐chan, Maria onee‐chan.
My uncles and aunts.
......Even Sakutarou.
 ......And then, there was the witch {f:5:Virgilia}, and Ronove, and...............
"...............Where............"
"You were fortunate.
 ......By chance, we found you drifting in the waves of the sea of emptiness.
 ......You were in a terrible state.
 ......It took much time to make you remember your true form."
".........{f:5:Beatrice}...
 ............So, this is......"
"The Golden Land.
 ......Your whole family has been waiting here for you to return."
"......We knew you would come home."
Did I.........come home because I was supposed to...?
......Didn\'t I............return to the form I was meant to have, ......and then...............
"No, you did come home."
"That\'s right.
 You made it back here because you wanted to come home to us."
".........Dad, ......Mom...
 .........I..............."
"You don\'t need to say anything.
 .........You\'ve been on a great and terrible journey, haven\'t you?
 ......You took that journey all by yourself..."
"You understand now, don\'t you?
 You won\'t forget again?"
I understand, ......Dad...
"......This is...a place you can always call home..."
"............I know..."
When I gave that answer, Mom and Dad hugged me again.
Hot tears fell onto my face.
They were Mom and Dad\'s tears......
"............‘All right’......might not be the best way to put it.
 ......But I\'m so glad.
 Glad you came home."
"......Aunt.........Eva......"
"Feel free to hate me as much as you want.
 ......But give your Mom and Dad a million kisses.
 ......Give a kiss to everyone who cared about you so much."
"Aunt...... ............Eva............."
".........And say "I\'m home" to your other mother."
Mom gave me a push from behind, ............and I stumbled forwards.
Towards my...other mother.
".........Eva...... ...............Mom............"
"......Ange‐chan..............."
"If only............I\'d called you that on that day,
 .........I might never have messed up......
 ......We might have been able......to create a new world together......"
"It\'s in the past now.
 ......You\'ve come home.
 .........You don\'t need to say anything else..."
"Mom......
 ............Mom.................."
"Welcome home, Ange‐chan...
 ............You\'re my precious daughter......"
"Mom......
 ............You were always, ......to the very end, .........the one looking out for me the most............"
The two of them hugged each other quietly, ......burying their faces in the other\'s shoulders and sobbing.
The truth...wasn\'t worth anything at all.
In the first place, ......the truth is always in the past.
The point of the future isn\'t to learn what happened in the past.
What really matters...is whether I truly live and prosper in the truth that is "the now".
How can there be any truth......in a life not truly lived?
Back when I only ever tried to see the truth of the past, I was nothing more than a ghost trapped in that past.
Since that time, I haven\'t lived a single day.
......Now, I truly understand.
This is what.........real truth is.........
"I will......live......
 ......And I\'ve remembered how much everyone loved me......"
Because I was young and selfish, I didn\'t even remember until now.
The kind grandpa who always spoiled me.
The entertaining aunts and uncles.
All of the kind and gentle servants.
......It was always...warm.
And yet, because I was young and cruel, I never even tried to retain any of those memories.
Everyone was distorted by my irresponsible imagination, ......and I completely forgot how things were......
Now, I can remember clearly, and I understand.
It\'s true that the Halloween quiz party itself was an illusion.
We never did anything like that.
......But there were all kinds of other fun things we did do when the relatives gathered,
 .........things that were no more or less fun than that party.........
Then, ......for the first time since the start of the game...
...I went up to each and every one of them......to greet them, thank them, and apologize.
To thank Grandpa for always pampering me.
To thank my aunts and uncles.
To thank the cousins for always playing with me even though I was so selfish.
......And to thank the creatures of fantasy......and apologize to them.
I think I said something horrible to Sakutarou once, in the past.
And to Maria onee‐chan too.
"......Maria onee‐chan, you really were a witch, weren\'t you?"
"I\'ve always been a witch.
 ......You approached that level yourself once, didn\'t you?"
"No.
 I never really understood.
 ......I felt sorry for you and your magic.
 ......I could only feel sorry for you...
 .........So, ......I couldn\'t pick up a fragment of happiness, couldn\'t even find one.
 .........You told me that yourself once, Onee‐chan......"
"......It can\'t be helped.
 It takes two to create a universe.
 ......I had Beato, but you were all alone."
"No.
 ......If only I could have called Aunt Eva "Mom", there would have been two of us.
 ......I\'m sure I\'d have been able to create a new world with the same magic you used, Maria onee‐chan."
".........All of it is my fault.
 The message bottles I threw into the sea for fun caused a distortion in your future and wore you down.
 ......I bear responsibility for that."
"......Yeah, seriously.
 It\'s all because of your message bottles.
 Because of those, people started copying you and making Forgeries, ......growing the story into something crazy."
However, the message bottles thrown into the sea by Beato did not name a specific person as the culprit.
......One of the Forgers wrote a plausible Forgery that had Ushiromiya Eva as the culprit, ......which spread like wildfire...
I should\'ve known better than anyone that it couldn\'t possibly be true, ......but even I accepted it in the end.
"............It isn\'t your fault, Beato.
 ......No matter how many people around me had their baseless suspicions,
 ......there should\'ve been only one truth inside me.
 And yet, so easily, ......I abandoned my warm memories of all of you,
 ......and surrendered my heart to them."
"No, no.
 If I had not thrown the message bottles, future Rokkenjima would never have become a flourishing ground for such bizarre misconceptions.
 I bear responsibility for it all."
"......True.
 That\'s right, it really is your fault after all."
"Mgh.
 ......It\'s a little irritating to hear you say it so boldly.
 ......I changed my mind, you have your share of the blame as well!"
"........................
 ......Yeah, you\'re right.
 You were at fault, and so was I.
 ......Still, it\'d be stupid for us to attack each other.
 ......After all, I\'m a witch of the future.
 You\'re a witch of the past.
 ......I should be using that magic to build my future.
 ......We both bear responsibility in some way,
 but neither of us has the right to blame the other."
".........I knew you could do it, Ange.
 I knew you\'d be able to understand Mariage Sorcière\'s teachings."
"You\'re right.
 ......As the final member of Mariage Sorcière, ......it\'s my responsibility to pass on your magic."
"My magic can make everyone happy."
"Indeed...!
 You have both pure magic and wicked magic at your fingertips...!"
".........That\'s true.
 Magic can change completely depending on your heart.
 ......You can\'t use magic properly without the proper guidance.
 ......And proper magic can guide people to happiness."
"It is a wonderful thing...
 .........Bringing people happiness is the sole reason that witches wield magic.
 ......I am very pleased that we were finally able to pass on this lesson to the last in the line of Endless Witches..."
"Sorry for failing to pass it down myself at all."
"Witch of the Future, {f:5:Ange Beatrice}.
 ......I hereby retract your expulsion from Mariage Sorcière."
"Uryuu!
 I knew Ange would come back...!"
"Congratulations, Ange‐sama!"
"......Back in the days when I traveled together with you all, I remember thinking I understood all this...but I didn\'t.
 ......I\'m sorry.
 I\'m really sorry......"
"Witches cannot create a universe unless there are two.
 ......In the future, you will be alone. ......Will you really be okay...?"
"Yeah, I\'ll be okay.
 ......I\'m not alone anymore.
 ......I\'ll...live.
 ......With everyone.
 And I\'ll live in the future.
 I swear to keep living, so that I can pass on the magic of Mariage Sorcière."
"Maria onee‐chan\'s magic has saved me too.
 .........There are a lot of people out there who need magic.
 Teaching it the right way and saving as many people as I can...
...is my mission as the final witch of Mariage Sorcière."
"Will you truly be able to do so...?"
"Of course. I have the power to do it.
 There\'s the golden magic that my predecessor, {f:5:Eva Beatrice}, spent so much time building.
 I\'ve inherited all of that. Right?"
"*giggle*.
 ......If only my health had held out a little longer, I was planning to spend all of it on myself."
*giggle*, ......ahahahahahahahahahaha.
As Ange laughed, tears poured from her eyes again.
Everyone surrounded Ange with their kind, warm smiles......
Battler stood alone in the rose garden maze, letting the rain quietly fall on him......
After searching for some time, Ange found him.
"............Onii‐chan........."
".............................."
Ange, who was feeling guilty, sensed anger in her brother\'s expression.
So, ......she thought he was going to hit her.
She shut her eyes tight.
However, her brother touched her softly.
He patted her head gently.
".........See?"
".................."
"The truth......wasn\'t anything important, was it?"
".........No, it wasn\'t.
 ......Even though you were here, ......waiting for me to come home in such a......warm world......
 .........I had my back turned......the whole time......"
"You learned the truth."
"...............Yeah..."
"So, any hopes you had of someone miraculously surviving and coming back......have been crushed.
 ......However, you now have a new mission and a new hope to help you live in the future."
"......You kept those precious hopes safe for me.
 ......And I opened the box with my own hands and let them all escape.
 ......It turned out worse than Pandora\'s box.
 ......A truth I didn\'t need to know flew out of the box, along with all my hopes, ......leaving nothing inside but empty space..."
"That\'s okay.
 ......It\'s open now, and that\'s that.
 An empty box isn\'t so bad—it\'s a clean slate, a fresh start.
 And anyway, if you\'re harboring false hopes, sometimes it\'s better just to pull out the thorn."
Battler laughed heartily.
Then, with that same smile on his face, he told her.
"We\'re already dead."
"...............Yeah."
"You\'ve lived twelve years on the hope that we might still be alive.
 Not anymore.
 That\'s over and done with."
"Yeah.
 ......I know.
 Starting now, ......I\'ll step forward into a new life."
"Beato put Rokkenjima in the cat box.
 The next witch, Auntie Eva, guarded the lid of that cat box her whole life.
 ......The witch after that was you, and you opened that lid, ......but so what?
 Why does the truth of the past matter?"
".........Yeah.
 ......From now on, I\'ll truly live.
 And I\'ll make my own personal truth prosper."
"Good luck,
 final witch of Mariage Sorcière.
 ......I\'ve read Maria\'s grimoire.
 It\'s a great book, with some really good stuff written in it."
"Even the Bible needs a translator.
 So, Maria\'s grimoire probably needs one too.
 ......You will be that translator.
 ......You\'ve got to teach it to kids who are in the position you once were.
 That\'s your mission as the new Witch of the Future."
"......Yeah."
"I\'m...gone.
 But I\'ll always be behind you, watching over you."
"I know.
 ......And not just you.
 Everyone else too..."
".........We all love you......and we\'ll love you forever and ever.
 Don\'t forget that......"
"......I won\'t...
 .........Never......never ever..............."
Ange leapt into Battler\'s chest......and sobbed.
{y:0:Human}{n:0:Human}s are sad creatures, who can "learn" but not "unlearn".
She had already learned.
It was a cruel, terrifying, merciless thing, ......capable of destroying even the miracle called hope.
......However, there was still one tiny fragment left gripped in her hand.
Her family\'s...love.
If Ange could just remember that love and hold on to it tightly.........then she could surely live on...
She could stop herself from taking that single step into nothingness......
"Besides... The Rokkenjima cat box hasn\'t yet been opened completely.
 ......You\'ve just taken a peek at what\'s inside.
 So now...you must be the lid yourself."
"And, this time, you\'ll be the one to protect everyone inside the cat box.
 Me and Dad and Kyrie‐san, the cousins and the uncles and the aunts.
 Grandfather and the servants.
 ......And all of the fantasy people."
"...............Yeah.
 ......This time......I have to......protect everyone........."
{a:c:
"Then shouldn\'t you hurry up a bit?"}
From the other side of a rose bush came the sound of popcorn being eaten.
......It was {f:5:Lambdadelta}.
"I\'m pretty sure you know this,
 ......but Bern is just about to hold a big party for the Book of the Single Truth.
 She\'s gathered beings from heaven and from hell, from the spirit world and from parallel worlds.
 If she announces what\'s in that book in a place like that, it\'ll all be too late, won\'t it?"
".........I\'m...going.
 ......I gave {f:5:Bernkastel} that key.
 It\'s my responsibility.
 I\'ll go and bring it back."
"The City of Books, is it?
 But there\'s no way for us to get in.
 There\'s a barrier around that place."
"......She gave me this.
 With it, I can come and go as I please.
 .........What an idiot.
 She forgot to collect it when she threw me away."
Ange fished through her pocket, and there was a jingling sound.
It was a bell with a blue ribbon tied to it.
".........That\'s it.
 One of those temporary entry passes that you get when you turn in your invitation.
 As long as you have that, at least one of you will be able to get into the City of Books.
 Well, as long as someone takes you across the sea of fragments first."
"{f:5:Lambdadelta}.
 Take me to the City of Books."
"......Ange."
"This is my way of taking responsibility.
 .........I\'ll see that the Book of the Single Truth isn\'t made public."
".........Are you serious?
 That place is a den of monsters among monsters.
 Now that you\'ve lost Bern\'s protection, you\'ll be weaker than a fly.
 You\'ll be smushed and that\'ll be the end of you."
"Ah—"
The bell was stolen from Ange\'s hands.
"{f:5:Lambdadelta}.
 I\'ll go there.
 ......I just need you to take me and send me on my way.
 I\'m an empty creature anyway, unable to exist outside the cat box.
 Ange, on the other hand, has to live on into the future.
 And you\'re also a person with a future.
 ......So I\'ll go.
 I have nothing to lose."
"No! This is my responsibility, my way of making up for what I did!
 If I don\'t do it myself, the future won\'t change at all, and I won\'t be able to save the cat box of the future...!"
Ange tried to snatch the bell from Battler\'s hand, but Battler had no intention of giving it up.
The two of them were grimly serious, but from the sidelines, it just looked like an ordinary squabble between two close siblings.
{f:5:Lambdadelta} watched this conversation and shrugged.
......If she just had to take either one of them to the City of Books, she wouldn\'t have to make any enemies, and there was no risk to her.
All she cared about was which one would make the story more interesting.
 Nothing else.
But then, she finally noticed.
"Hold on.
 ......Hold on a sec, you two. Hold on!"
"What\'s your problem?! Save it for later!!"
"We\'re having an important sibling discussion here!"
"Okay, first off,
 let go of each other.
 ......Battler\'s holding the bell now, right?
 Jump, Battler."
"......Jump?
 Like this?"
Jingle jingle.
"You next, Ange.
 Try jumping."
"......Why me as well...?"
Jingle jingle.
"Huh......?
 ......Why......?"
If Battler was holding the bell, where did that sound come from......?
Ange hurriedly searched through her pockets.
When she did, ......another blue‐ribboned bell came out of a different pocket than the first one.
"These are......the same, aren\'t they...?"
"......No way......
 Why are there two?
 I was only given one of them!"
"I don\'t know why.
 But the point is, you\'ve got two bells that\'ll get you into the City of Books.
 Therefore, I don\'t have to sit here and watch the two of you play with each other anymore."
The pair of them gripped their bells and looked at each other.
"From the very beginning,
 this game has belonged to the two of you.
 ......There\'s just been a slight change in who the opponent is."
"......This game isn\'t a competition between you two.
 It\'s a fight over the cat box, with you two who want to close the lid on one team, ......and Bern who wants it opened on the other.
 Ange has moved from Bern\'s team to Battler\'s team.
 That\'s all there is to it."
"{f:5:Lambdadelta}.
 Take us to the City of Books."
".........I hope you know I\'m just taking you there!
 After that, I\'m done being anything but a spectator!
 I\'m just gonna be sitting nearby and watching, to see exactly how you fight, what you do, and how Bern is going to make mincemeat out of you both...!"
"{f:5:Lambdadelta}...... Thank you!"
