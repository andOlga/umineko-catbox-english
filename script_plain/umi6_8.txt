"Come on, it\'s okay now. Let\'s hurry."
"I, I hope Father likes sweet foods......"
"Oh yes, he does like them.
 In fact, he seems to enjoy eating pretty much anything.
 Hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho."
After waiting for the master of the study to be out, Beato and Kumasawa entered the study.
Then, they quickly tidied away the books on the desk, set down the basket they had brought there, and began spreading out the contents.
Inside......were several cute cookies cut out in a butterfly shape.
They set out a cute plate and neatly decorated it with the cookies.
It was the kind of slight adornment that the person eating wasn\'t likely to even notice.
 The whole setup was filled with that sort of feeling.
"You spare no efforts for the sake of your beloved father."
"This is......all I\'m permitted to do right now."
"To think that I would give Battler cookies...
 Why should I, the ruler of the night, do so much for a guest who comes so rarely?"
Then, the study door swung violently open.
It was Battler, with Genji by his side...
Battler\'s eyes went wide for a second when he saw Beato there, but his expression quickly went blank again.
"......What are you doing here?"
"Father, ......please excuse me.
 I didn\'t come here to get in the way of your important game......"
"How were you able to get in here...?
 Wasn\'t this room locked?"
"......My apologies.
 I lent them a key because they wished to surprise you with a gift."
"See, have a look...!
 BEATRICE‐sama baked these cookies with all her soul, hoping that you would enjoy them."
"Kumasawa‐san and Genji‐san taught me...
 I never knew Genji‐san was so good at baking cookies."
"Hoh‐hoh‐ho.
 He hasn\'t done it much of late, but Genji‐san used to cook many things long ago.
 He was especially good with sweets...!"
"Cookies...?"
"Y‐yes.
 It\'s a gift for you, Father.
 I sincerely pray for your victory in this important match..."
Battler looked at the plate on the study desk that was piled up with beautiful cookies...and the message card of encouragement lying next to it,
 .........and his face twisted with a complex expression, which might have had traces of both sadness and anger contained within it...
"............My lord..."
In not so many words, Genji prompted him to consider giving Beato\'s efforts some kind of acknowledgment...
Battler understood.
......He had no reason to respond to this kindness with displeasure.
However, even though he understood that logically,
 ......all he could do was give a small exasperated sigh.
"......Thank you, I\'m very grateful.
 ......But I don\'t like sweets.
 Please take it away."
"M‐......my lord..."
"....................."
"Don\'t make me say the same thing again.
 ......Please clean it up and take it away."
"M‐my lord, couldn\'t you try just one bite...?
 BEATRICE‐sama worked hard to make them for your sake..."
"......I\'m grateful for the sentiment.
 ......I\'m in the middle of a very important game right now.
 Important to both me...
and Beato.
 .........And it will be our last.
 So please.
 Try not to trouble me any more than necessary."
"That\'s just too sad for her...!
 I\'m glad that you are grateful for her feelings,
 but can\'t you show it by taking just one little bite...?!"
".....................Father..."
Beato looked at Battler sadly.
......Battler hung his head to avoid her gaze.
The expression on his face was more pained than any he had shown Beato before...
"..................
 ......Kumasawa, clean this up and take it away."
"My lord...!!"
"..........................."
Kumasawa implored Battler to listen, but he turned his back to her...
"......My...apologies...
 ......Let\'s clean this up, Kumasawa‐san..."
"I won\'t allow it.
 By making this gift, BEATRICE‐sama gave it her all to try and support you in your important game in the only way she could.
 To tell her to take it away without eating a bite yourself... How can you trifle with a woman so?!!"
".........Kumasawa."
"If you call yourself a man,
 you should at least try a bite when a woman makes you a handmade snack!!
 If you truly intend to trample on this woman\'s feelings, I promise you this,
 I will not back down even if it kills me! No I won\'t!!"
"K‐
......Kumasawa‐san,
 ......you\'ve done enough for me already......"
"I won\'t allow it!!
 My lord, do you think there might be poison inside them?!"
"..........................."
......Yeah,
 if Beato ever came to give me cookies......
......of course I\'d think that she\'d put some kind of crazy poison in them......
She asked me if I thought there\'d be poison in these?
How could anyone ever think...
...that cookies like these, piled up in such a neat and cute way,
 .......could possibly have something bizarre hidden inside...?
And...
......who could possibly believe...
......that Beato...
......would make something like this......?
Because of that, ......Battler couldn\'t bear to look at Beato\'s innocent reaction,
 which was completely free from any malicious thoughts of slipping poison into the cookies......
Beato quietly started to clean up.
 ......Every now and then, she sniffled.
Kumasawa had been glaring at Battler continuously,
 but she now gave a small sigh and helped Beato clean up.
However, the hardness didn\'t disappear from her expression.
".........My apologies, Father.
 ...Please excuse me."
"Don\'t call me that......"
".................."
"Don\'t call me Father.
 ......Beato never once called me that."
"Y‐......yes, as you wish...
 ......My apologies..."
Hanging her head so low that her chin touched her chest, Beato hurried out of the study.
After giving Battler a look, Kumasawa chased after her.
She shut the door a bit violently, and the footsteps of the pair rapidly disappeared off into the distance...
".....................
 ......I may be his little sister, but I\'m not sure how I feel about that."
"If she were anyone other than Beato, you\'d think of him as a true enemy of women, is that it...?"
"......I don\'t have a clue why Onii‐chan and Beato act so friendly together.
 Right now, I think of Beato as our greatest enemy, the one we must defeat.
 ......Still, even so...
 As a woman, ......I can\'t say I like Onii‐chan\'s reaction."
"Though I can understand Battler\'s feelings a little.
 ......What a sad state of affairs."
I still don\'t understand what kind of bad blood or connection there was between them.
However, Onii‐chan probably views Beato......as a friendly adversary, if not something more.
Onii‐chan\'s reason for defeating Beato isn\'t to destroy an enemy out of hatred.
 ......It feels like he wants to give a sincere answer to her questions.
Yes.
 I can\'t deny the fact that their fight isn\'t based on hatred...
but on a stronger emotion.
".........And on top of that...
...Beato really is something, to remain dedicated to Onii‐chan even after being treated so coldly.
 I agree with the other, older sister BEATRICE.
 ......I can\'t understand why she\'s so dedicated to Onii‐chan."
"And, though it may take a thousand years,
 that single factor that you do not understand must be passed on to the Golden Witch BEATRICE we know so well..."
"......Yes.
 I understand that.
 ......Knowing this Beato leads to knowing the Beato who is to come.
 ......It may explain the greatest piece in this crazy game, if not the game board itself..."
"Such a mysterious witch......"
Though she said those words, FEATHERINE wore a confident smile on her face.
Her sarcastic confidence, as though she already knew the answer, was unchanged.
".........BEATRICE.
 I want to ask you something."
"Y‐......yes, what would you like to know, Ange‐san...?"
Beato, who had been reading a fragment book in the shadows of the study, jumped when Ange called out to her.
"......Why do you call Ushiromiya Battler "Father"?"
"B‐because he created the piece that I am..."
"......In that case, why are you so dedicated to Ushiromiya Battler?
 Is there some rule that pieces must obey the creator who made them?"
"There is no such rule.
 ......Pieces are tools, ...like a knife.
 ......If the Game Master uses them well, they can be quite useful.
 However, if you use them incorrectly, they can hurt you as well.
 ......Whether the tool is used as a tool or a weapon, that has nothing to do with the tool\'s own will.
 It is merely the result."
"In that case, why are you so dedicated towards Onii‐chan?
 It\'s almost as though......that\'s your purpose as a piece."
"Y‐.........yes.
 ...That is the purpose for which I was born."
"Did Onii‐chan, the one who gave birth to you, give you that purpose?"
"You have that wrong.
 ......Battler merely set "a piece with that role" on the board as the Game Master.
 ......The one who gave birth to this piece...
was the first Game Master and the one who created this game, BEATRICE herself..."
"......Aaah, this is getting confusing.
 ......In other words, you keep calling Onii‐chan "Father", but he\'s not actually your father.
 ......You\'re just calling him that affectionately,
 because you feel that you have to dedicate yourself to him."
"Y‐......yes.
 ......I think that\'s true.
 Father was the one who placed me on the game board.
 If he hadn\'t, my piece would never have had a turn.
 So, the reason I exist here right now and the reason I am able to devote myself to my purpose...is all thanks to Father."
"......I see.
 So that\'s why it makes sense for you to call him Father.
 ......In that case, who told you to devote yourself to Onii‐chan?
 ......Oh, right, that\'s the first Game Master, Beato herself.
 ......Aaaahh, this is so confusing."
"You wish to ask her why she must serve Ushiromiya Battler, correct?
 However, she cannot give you that answer.
 She was given nothing but the purpose itself.
 ......Only the person who gave her that purpose knows the reasons for which they did so."
"......I see.
 "Consider that as well, child of man", right?
 ......So, that means you already have an idea and you\'re laughing at my confusion."
"*cackle*cackle*.
 You really are just perfect for my miko..."
".........I will......do anything for Father.
 ...My existence will bring Father happiness.
 ......That is my greatest pleasure.
 ......And............"
At that point, Beato hesitated.
"What?
 And what?"
"Y‐yes...
 ......And...
......if I could one day have Father acknowledge my efforts,
 ......there would be no greater happiness for me..."
"Pft........."
".........What the hell.
 ......If you only wanted to serve him, I\'d say you\'re just another piece of the witch\'s furniture,
 ......but you want him to acknowledge your efforts?
 That\'s less like furniture and more like—"
Ange stopped mid‐sentence.
......That\'s less like furniture and more like...
......you\'re just a girl...
......who loves Onii‐chan.
..................I don\'t...get it.
The guiding force behind this Beato\'s actions...is that of a girl who adores Onii‐chan.
But then, what would that make her?
If she liked Onii‐chan, then she should have adored him and done things for him herself.
Why would she create "a piece of herself", a separate entity, to do it......?
This way, ......even if she does attract Onii‐chan\'s attention, it will be towards the piece version of herself,
 ......not the creator who made that piece.
If I ever fall in love with someone, I\'ll probably want to do things for them.
But of course, I would want to do those things myself.
After all, I would want him to notice me.
This love is destined to go virtually unrewarded...... No matter how devoted she is, she will never get anything out of it.
And she\'s done this out of her own free will...
Beato\'s behavior looks no different from that of an average girl in love.
She\'s devotedly doing all she can for him, dreaming that her kindness will eventually be acknowledged.
......Why would Beato create a piece like this...?
Is putting it in terms of romance a bit too confusing?
 Then let\'s try using food as an example.
It\'s as pointless as creating "a piece to eat food for you".
No matter how much food your piece eats on your behalf, you won\'t get any less hungry, right?
You are the one who wants to eat.
There\'s no reason for having a piece do that in your place.
For most jobs in the world, you can get someone else to do it for you.
 However, with love and food alone, there can never be any meaning in letting another person do it in your place.
That\'s right.
 ......This Beato was created as a "piece"...for an impossible reason......
......Though at a glance, she looks like just a normal girl,
 .........the more I learn about her, the less I understand, ......like an imaginary number......
"......Father hates it when I call him Father.
 ......And the "me" that Father desires...didn\'t call him by that name either."
"Right.
 The former "you" spoke to everyone without even using honorifics."
"..................
 However, ......simply possessing that knowledge doesn\'t mean I can refer to Father quite that informally.
 ......I\'d like to do my best......and make a start by calling him Battler‐san."
"I\'m surprised you haven\'t gotten discouraged after being treated so coldly."
"......Fath—
no,
 ......Battler‐san is in the middle of an important game right now.
 His opponent is the formidable Lady Erika, piece of the great Lady BERNKASTEL."
"......I stepped in at a delicate moment in his game, just as it was starting to reach the critical part,
 ......and called Battler‐san by that name he doesn\'t want to hear,
 ......so it\'s no surprise that he was in a bad mood..."
"....................."
Apparently, Beato still wanted to devote herself to Battler, even after being treated in such a cold manner.
Though to an outsider, it just looks as though she\'s being snubbed, ......it doesn\'t faze her at all.
It truly is the blindness of a girl in love......
"......Or is it that I can\'t {y:1:‘see’}{n:1:see} because I have no love?"
"At times, love can make the invisible {y:1:‘visible’}{n:1:visible}."
Beato once again immersed herself in the fragment book that told of her former self.
......She was trying to find something about the Beato that Battler desired.
Ange shrugged, as though saying "well, I don\'t get it".
FEATHERINE laughed when she saw this, and quipped that an "innocent young woman" could never understand.
Ange grumbled something back unhappily.
Their interactions seemed to have no effect whatsoever on Beato as she sat in the shadows of the library......
After chasing all the others out, ......only Battler remained in the study.
There was no color in this dimly lit room.
However, ......for just the short time that the plate of cookies had been placed there,
 the room had seemed at least a little cheery...
Battler\'s gaze drifted over to the desk, ......which no longer had anything on it.
When he did, the cookie plate that had been there until a second ago was revived.
However, ......it was an illusion.
Though the cookies could be looked at, they could not be touched, much less eaten...
If Battler wished, he could make it possible to "touch them" or "eat them", ......but it would be an empty sensation.
It would only give the touch and taste that Battler desired.
......He no longer had any way of knowing...
...what kind of cookies they had actually been.
"..........................."
In a reception sofa facing Battler,
 ......a cloud of gold butterflies slowly gathered,
 ...and took the form of the old Beato.
"‘Come o~n, have a bite☆ It\'s not every day that I\'ll make these by hand...!
 Have no fear, I\'m confident in how well they\'ve turned out.’"
"‘Pu ku ku ku!
 Hearing that from Milady makes them all the more dubious.’"
"......Seriously.
 ......Any cookies you made would obviously have some kind of strange poison in them."
"‘Shocking that you should think so.
 Even if I did put something in, it\'d be no worse than the kind that does this and maybe that to your you‐know‐what.
 Uhyahyahya!’"
"‘It\'s because you do that sort of thing all the time that Battler‐kun will never agree to eat them.’"
"‘Huh? Putting things in someone\'s food is pretty basic, isn\'t it?
 Fingernails, bits of hair, magic charms, fragments of love...eheheheheheheheh!
 What would you people put in?’"
"‘Yes, ma\'aaam!!
 I wouldn\'t put anything in them! I\'d just eat them all myself!’"
"‘Obviously. Do you have to be so predictable?!!’"
"‘Well, they say a girl\'s gotta grab by all three sacks☆ The first step is the stomach, right?
 Next comes the wallet...so what could the third one be?! *giggle*☆’"
"‘If I could catch a guy\'s attention, I\'d want to make him sacrifice his body, heart, and soul to me!
 That\'s why I pour all my power and affection into my cooking.’"
"‘Heheh, in any event, giving someone food that you\'ve cooked yourself is probably a frontal attack as old as time.’"
"‘Ridiculous.
 How pathetic to think that you require such tricks to grasp a man\'s heart.’"
"‘Ohh~?
 I\'d be very interested in hearing how much experience you have in grasping a man\'s heart, Onee‐sama!’"
"‘Battler, there\'s nothing weird in it, so have a bi~te.
 Don\'t think you\'ll ever get a chance to eat my handmade cookies again☆’"
.........There probably won\'t...be another chance.
I slowly stretched out my hand,
 ......out to the illusion of the cookie plate,
 ......and touched it.
Just before I did, it became a cloud of gold butterflies, ......and vanished into the darkness of the study.
The illusions of Ronove and VIRGILIA also disappeared.
...However, the illusion of Beato alone still remained on the sofa.
"......Is there something that does not satisfy you?"
"............Are you really going to make me say it?"
"*cackle*cackle*cackle*.
 ......The more the new "me" differs from the form you wished for,
 ......the more you are reminded that I can never be revived again,
 ......correct?"
"..........................."
"*cackle*cackle*!
 If you let a good woman get away, you never get a second chance.
 So, only now, you\'ve finally realized what a good woman I wa~s."
"......Shut up.
 If you never appear again,
 ......that\'d be a relief."
"Hmph..............."
Beato lay sprawled on the sofa and looked up at the ceiling.
Battler also turned his back and moved to the window. ......For a while, there was silence.
"I think you understand, but......"
"......I do understand."
"The "me" you were expecting...has already disappeared."
"......I know.
 ......Even though that Beato is you without a doubt, ......she\'s a different being than the former you...
......and I can say with certainty......that you will never revive again..."
"My soul, femininity, sparkling personality, and splendid character were cultivated in a thousand years spent as a witch.
 Unless an exactly identical thousand years is traversed, it is impossible to become me.
 In short, ......from the very moment you decide to create me, my personal history will be different."
"Yeah.
 ............That damn BERNKASTEL has already guaranteed that you\'ll never revive..."
"However, you still hope for it, don\'t you?"
".............................."
"One day, the new "me" trips and lands on her head, and all her memories of the past are spectacularly restored!
 ......You\'re hoping for something like that, aren\'t you?
 Ahyahyahyahya!
 A delusional plot like that wouldn\'t even pass in a light novel these days!"
"......Shut up.
 ......Don\'t pretend you didn\'t do the same.
 ......You waited and waited...
...for me to remember...
...and take notice..."
"..........................."
"........................"
Then, ......what?
Does this mean...
......that our relationship now...
...is exactly the opposite of how it once was......?
".........Hmph...
 ......Well, there was a time when I continued the game believing that you would eventually notice and remember,
 ......that a miracle would occur."
"..................How did it feel?
 ......When you were playing those games with me."
"*cackle*cackle*cackle*...
 As they say, look inside your own heart..."
"..........................."
......It\'s tough.
If only she didn\'t look so much like you, ......I wouldn\'t be so confused about how to feel about her.
"Well, do as you wish.
 In the past, I toyed with you and tormented you.
 .........Now\'s your chance for revenge against me.
 ......The new "me" will just wander about, ignorant of everything.
 You may boil or burn her as you see fit.
 Perhaps it will clear away an old hatred."
"............If she was you, I would.
 It\'d probably make me feel a lot better.
 ......But...
.........that Beato...
...isn\'t you."
"Who is she, then, if not me?"
"......Someone very like you,
 .........but a different person."
"However, there can be no doubt that she is also me."
".........Yeah.
 She is you,
 ......and at the same time,
 ...she\'s a different person."
"In that case, the new "me" is most unfortunate.
 She is being treated like a plaything in my place.
 ......*cackle*cackle*, how truly pitiable."
"...................................."
That might......be the contradiction inside me.
Because the new Beato seems like a different person, I can\'t accept her.
Even though I know she\'s a different person than Beato, ......she keeps reminding me of her.
"In that case,
 ......think of her as my daughter."
".........Your daughter.........?"
"Consider her a blood daughter of mine who closely resembles me.
 After all, she is my double, but hasn\'t lived a thousand years, so calling her that is not incongruous."
"......True..."
"Imagine that I have died, left behind a daughter, ......and entrusted her to you.
 That way, won\'t it become a little easier to think of how to deal with her?"
"That\'s actually a good analogy. ......It\'s unlike you."
"Do not jest.
 That is my daughter.
 She is the child I left behind after my death.
 .........You are free to press my likeness upon her.
 You may also let loose your pent‐up resentment on her in my place."
"......Making her bear my sins and torturing her as you please may allow you to give vent to your emotions.
 If that is not to your taste, you can also guide her down the right path so that she does not end up on the inhumane road that I have tread."
"......She was made to devote herself to you since the moment of her birth.
 If you wish, you can mold her into any shape you desire.
 .........With a miracle of a thousand years, she might even become me."
"......So, I could even strip her and drag her around with a chain, like you did to me once."
"*cackle*cackle*.
 Yes, at this point, even greater humiliation would be possible..."
".....................So she is both your double...
and...
your daughter,
 ......huh..."
Without a doubt, she is exactly the same person, the same piece, which was created once more by the rule called BEATRICE.
However, when I can\'t accept it that way, .........I can interpret her as being Beato\'s daughter.
 ......This served as a clear guidepost on how to interact with her and smooth the uncertainty in my heart.
............And...
...finally...
......I could understand...
......how cruel I had been to her just now......
My tears poured to the ground, ......and when I followed them with my eyes...
I noticed that a white card about the size of a business card had fallen onto the floor.
It was...
...the message card that had adorned those cookies.
I had rushed her, telling her to clean up and leave right away, which was probably why it had fallen to the floor unnoticed.
I picked it up,
 .........and read the message on it.
.........It was...
extremely short,
 ...pure,
 ......and sincere.
It brought tears to my eyes, ......so I was sure that I could read it.
......And yet,
 ......my eyes were so blurred with tears...
...that I couldn\'t...
......see anything.........
......The flood of light and sound slowly dissipated.
The silence that followed was not broken by any noise, not even the sound of the wind and rain outside that had been so clearly audible moments before.
Both Jessica...
...and George...
...timidly opened their eyes...
......Where in the world...
...was this......?
It was a strange room that they had never seen before.
It looked like a Western tea room.
......Its furnishings were stylish and expensive.
It felt as though a dignified person must own this room.
Preparations for black tea were set on the table, ......and so was a chessboard, which seemed to be halfway through a game.
However, there was something strangely out of place.
The black and white checkerboard pattern made it feel like chess,
 ......but it looked like a very similar yet totally different game that no one knew of.
In the same way that it both looked like chess and not like chess...
...the furnishings of this room—no, the room as a whole—looked at first glance like a Western tea room...
...but also felt like something completely different...
".........J‐
...just where...
is this place......?"
"......Jessica‐chan and Kanon‐kun...
 ...............Shannon?
 Where\'s Shannon...?!"
"I\'m right here, George‐sama."
"And I am here.
 ......Milady, George‐sama.
 We apologize for bringing you to a place like this."
"......What on Earth is going on?
 ......You took out something that looked like a butterfly wing and it started shining, and then..."
"Th‐the same thing happened to me...!
 Kanon‐kun took out this golden butterfly brooch thing, it started to sparkle, and..."
"Milady, George‐san, first of all, please allow us to apologize.
 And please stay calm.
 ......Something strange is about to happen.
 That strange thing will probably test us."
"Test us......?
 ...Do you mean...
that trial you were just talking about...
...that we have to overcome if we want to be together?
 ......Is that it?"
"A......a trial?"
".........I haven\'t explained it to you yet, Milady.
 My apologies.
 .........But please,
 ...if your words just a second ago were the truth, ......please lend me your strength.
 I will......give it everything I\'ve got, so please......"
"......I...I\'m not getting any of this...
 Do you know something, George nii‐san?"
"A bit.
 .........I\'m just as surprised as you about what\'s happening now.
 But if they say that this is an unavoidable trial that\'s essential for us to go through, I intend to take on whatever may come."
"...............A trial......?"
"Kanon‐kun.
 The brooch."
"Yeah......"
The two of them brought the halves of the broken golden butterfly brooch closer to each other.
As they grew closer, the strength of their bright yellow radiance increased.
"......Jessica‐chan, I want you to brace yourself for this.
 I am already mentally prepared."
"Wh‐what are you talking about...?!
 I don\'t have a clue!
 What the hell\'s going on...?!"
"It\'s a trial.
 A test for a pair of lovers."
"H‐......huuh...?!"
George spoke those corny words without any hesitation.
It was such an embarrassing line that Jessica couldn\'t help turning red,
 ......but the expression on George\'s face, which was so serious that it was almost grim, forced her to tense up as well...
Shannon and Kanon were just as serious.
......With a glow in their eyes, as though they were taking part in a sacred duel, the pair of them brought the two gold butterfly wings together.
Then, the wings they held became a single brooch......and regained their magical power.
An even more intense light filled the room...
...and the scene was burnt into the retinas of all present...
...as the brooch shattered and two shining things flew out of it...
"People live for the sake of love!
 Yes, this world is love itself!"
"Oh, how great is the power of love...!
 Love is everything!!"
Suddenly, the voices of two people they had never heard before rang out.
What was this?
 Who were they...?
George and Jessica nervously opened their eyes......
When they did, they saw that two demons had appeared there,
 ......almost as though the brooch which had once been split in two had become them...
"Oh?! This is odd, Furfur...!!
 Why are we in a place like this?!"
"It really is strange, Zepar...!!
 There\'s no one but {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s and furniture!
 Where is the witch?
 Where is the witch capable of summoning us?!"
"Yes, we remember well the name of the witch of the contract, don\'t we?
 Why don\'t we try calling her, Furfur?!"
"Yes, you\'re right, Zepar!!
 We know the name of the witch of the contract, the Golden Witch!"
"Then let\'s try calling her name!"
"All together now..."
""BEATRICEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!""
Given their manner, exaggerated like a theater play, and their slightly ridiculous style of talking,
 it would probably be hard to immediately comprehend the great power these demons possessed.
When the two demons called BEATRICE\'s name, a cyclone of gold butterflies picked up throughout the room.
Then, it took the form of two Golden Witches...
"What\'s this?! There are two BEATRICEs...!"
"Well, there are two of us as well.
 Why shouldn\'t there be two BEATRICEs every now and then?"
"This is my double and my little sister.
 We two are the same and as a single person."
"P‐......pleased to meet you."
"It has been a long time, BEATRICE‐sama..."
"..........................."
"A‐......am I dreaming......?"
"......I feel the same.
 Still, it\'s too early to get dumbfounded."
Unlike Jessica, George had maintained his composure even during this bizarre scene.
......After all, Shannon had already told him what would happen next.
"Demons of the contract, it has been too long...!
 Zepar.
 And you too, Furfur."
"Ah, long time no see!
 You seem to be in high spirits as always!"
"But look at your cute little sister here!
 Those juicy eyes must have the taste of white peaches when they grow teary...!"
"Uh, ......ah, ...well, I wonder..."
Zepar and Furfur latched onto Beato from either side, wearing strange smiles.
Each movement they made was exaggerated yet polished,
 as though they were acting out a play.
"Leave it at that for now, demons of the contract.
 To think that tonight will be the last time we see that mischievous spirit.
 It will be dearly missed."
"The last time......?"
"The brooch, our vessel, has already been destroyed!"
"Eheheheheh, in other words, our role is now finished!
 Ah, yes, it has been fun, BEATRICE!"
"However, it was decided when the contract was made.
 It was decided that we must lend our power one more time before our final farewell."
"So, this is truly the final miracle!"
"Once is enough for the miracle of love!
 After all, eternal love will never be needed a second time!"
"......There you have it.
 Lovers male and female!
 Gathered here are those cursed, absent a miracle, to unsuccessful love.
 The power of the golden butterfly brooch, which can grant such a miracle, is your last chance, and like it or not, this chance is limited to this evening!
 This miracle can be given only to a single pair!"
"..........................."
"......I won\'t lose."
"Yeah.
 ......Let\'s both give it our all."
Shannon and Kanon exchanged a serious gaze.
......Both had already readied themselves to fight for the sake of their love\'s success.
"I, I don\'t really get it,
 ...but I don\'t wanna borrow the power of some strange demon...!"
Jessica was finally starting to figure out the direction things were headed.
These demons......were probably planning to pit her and Kanon against George and Shannon.
"Let me be totally clear: we don\'t need your help!
 Kanon‐kun and I can handle our relationship by ourselves.
 I\'m not gonna be pressured into turning to some shady demons for help!"
"............Milady, please listen.
 ...If we don\'t overcome this trial,
 ......we cannot be together..."
"Jessica. Accept it.
 This is the only trial that can be imposed on upstart furniture wishing to be joined with a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}."
"More of this stuff about furniture and {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s!
 Yammer on about that all you want,
 it has nothing to do with us!!"
"You still haven\'t told Milady...?"
"......I didn\'t know...how I should explain it."
"Kanon‐kun, Shannon, and you, George nii‐san!
 Why are you listening to these creeps?!
 No one can stand in the way of a person\'s love!
 Why do we have to get approval from these demons?!
 It\'s none of their business!!"
"Well, it seems we have quite a troublesome blockhead among us.
 .........We could begin the game like this, but that would hardly be fair."
"C‐......couldn\'t you explain it for her?
 ...I don\'t understand that well myself.
 Is there some kind of problem with the love between Jessica‐san and Kanon‐san...?"
"Oh my!
 It seems you understand nothing at all!"
"With our blessing, the pair can cultivate their love at their leisure!
 No need to worry about suspicious demons!"
"However, without our blessing,
 your love will vanish, disappear, wither, and decay."
"How the hell\'re you so sure?!!"
""Because it is fate!!
 You may choose not to accept it, you may choose not to resist it!""
".........Oh, what happens if you choose not to resist it...?"
"That love will end.
 ......Well, an abstract explanation isn\'t so convincing.
 Well now, how could one explain the dead end fate you\'re in..."
"Ushiromiya Jessica, the future you two share is far more grim than you realize."
"If you don\'t gain the miracle of magic, disaster will most certainly befall you both."
"The infection within will fester...
and split the two of you apart.
 ......Even I will not be so boorish as to describe the details of that process.
 However, if you will not believe, Jessica, I will tell you how it ends.
 ......Kanon will stop being a servant and will leave the island.
 For all eternity."
"You will probably leave the island yourself in search of the one you love, but such a venture will doubtless be in vain!"
"Yes, and then you will mourn and hate!"
"Hate who?!"
"You!!"
"Me?!"
""No, the "you" of this moment!!""
With a dramatic gesture, the two of them pointed at Jessica.
......They were saying that, if she passed this by, it would be herself who would regret it later.
"Wh‐
......what the hell are you...
...saying......"
"When you have lost the one you love, you will realize...
how much you hate the person you were when you ran away from the trial to complete that love!"
"Yes, we\'re messengers from the "you" of the future!
 Please, at this very moment, take your love seriously and fight!"
"And if you don\'t listen to the message of the "you" from the future?!"
"The foolish snake eating its own tail will keep on gulping!"
"The endless cycle of suffering will swallow itself......and simply vanish."
"What the......hell are you talking about...?!!"
Jessica\'s confusion showed up on her face as anger.
......However, a memory of something she had heard a long time ago surfaced in the back of her mind.
......Unlike Nee‐san, I don\'t plan on working here for many years...
After just a few years, ......or possibly...
......If Nee‐san ever decides to stop working here, ......I think I\'ll stop working too.........
"Kanon......kun......"
"........................"
"If you give up on the miracle of magic and leave it to Shannon and George,
 ......they will be joined and leave the island.
 ......After that, Kanon will leave the island as well.
 That is an unavoidable fate."
"Th‐......then what if they can obtain the miracle of magic...?"
"Of course, Kanon will remain on the island, by Jessica\'s side for all time.
 ......He will probably be able to start learning music with Jessica as she wished for.
 ......How their relationship will progress afterwards is a matter for the two lovers.
 They may deepen their relationship slowly all by themselves, as Jessica wanted..."
"......However,
 ...if that happens, George‐san and I will not be joined."
".........For the sake of our own happiness and futures,
 ......we are fated to fight."
"A‐......are you kidding me...?!
 What the hell...?!
 So if we are joined, the other pair will split apart?!
 What kind of demon\'s game is this?!!"
"Don\'t be mistaken.
 You will not be taking something from each other.
 ......Without the power of the golden butterfly brooch, neither love is fated to bear fruit."
"A‐and who the hell decided that?!!"
"It is due to your sin of falling in love with furniture, which is not allowed to love.
 ......Didn\'t Kanon clearly reject you, saying that furniture was not qualified to love?!
 Knowing that, you chose Kanon as the one you loved.
 I won\'t let you get away with saying you didn\'t know...!"
"...............!"
Though she couldn\'t accept any of it, Jessica was unable to argue back.
Then, George spoke up with that soft tone that he always used to smooth things over.
......However, his expression was still ruthlessly serious.
"......Jessica‐chan,
 can\'t you think of it this way?"
"Think of it......what way...?"
"I love Shannon.
 I am prepared to overcome any and all trials and obstacles that stand in the way of us being together.
 .........What about you?"
"W‐well, yeah, ......one or two setbacks aren\'t gonna stop me, I\'m tougher than that..."
"Yes.
 That\'s what this is about.
 ......Right now, we are being tested.
 Tested to see who can display the strength of our feelings more strongly."
".........Are you actually......satisfied with this insanity...?"
"There\'s no need to be satisfied.
 ......When I gave Shannon that engagement ring, I swore to fight all trials and barriers that stand in my way.
 ......No matter how unreasonable or incomprehensible those trials might be,
 ......backing down is not an option."
George spoke clearly, ......then looked at Jessica with a cold gaze.
......By now, Jessica almost understood.
If she kept on grumbling and refusing this demons\' trial,
 ......the game between the two groups would automatically end with her defeat by default.
In other words, George and Shannon would win.
Then they would gain the miracle of magic, their love would be completed,
 .........and Jessica and Kanon would split apart,
 ......with Kanon eventually leaving the island and never seeing her again.
"......Personally,
 ......nothing would make me happier than you backing out of this trial.
 ......That way, I wouldn\'t have to fight you.
 And it would reveal just how little you actually feel for Kanon‐kun."
"Nn...............gah............"
It seemed as though George spoke ruthlessly, ......but he was actually being exceptionally fair.
If it came to a loss by default, Jessica would never be able to clear away her lingering regrets.
That would leave a bad aftertaste even for George.
"......We must fight fair and square for that single miracle.
 ......Even if I lose at the end,
 ......I\'ll be able to accept it if we both gave it our all.
 And because of that, I will be able to cheer on the victors from the bottom of my heart."
"............Hmph.
 ...George\'s determination is quite impressive."
"After hearing all that—"
"Are you still going to run away?"
The two demons giggled and challenged her.
Of course, George didn\'t laugh, but he too challenged her with cold eyes.
".........And Shannon......?"
"......Please forgive me, Milady.
 ......For the sake of being joined with George‐san, I am determined not to flinch in my resolve.
 .........Even if I know...
...that staying true to my heart...
...will mean the end of your loving relationship."
Shannon had never before spoken to Jessica with such serious and solemn words.
Jessica was surprised to realize just how strong the determination was that dwelt within her usually weak and clumsy friend.
"Kanon‐kun........."
"I......want to start a new life with you, Milady.
 ......Even if that life...
......means crushing Nee‐san\'s happiness...
......I will not falter now..."
Kanon was also doing all he could to be strong.
Yes.
All of them...
...were being serious and frank...
and abandoning any naivety they might have possessed.
All this about golden butterfly brooches and miracles of magic...
...and the trial that the demons were giving them—
none of it mattered.
Only one thing was being tested:
 whether or not they possessed the strong will to make their love come true.
Jessica clenched her fists, ......and hung her head, shaking, while biting her lower lip.
She was silent, but she would probably gain an unswerving will of steel before too long.
......She just needed a little time first.
The two demons who taunted people with dramatic gestures...
did not violate this silence that Jessica needed to resolve herself.
Love brings about conflict, and this conflict gives rise to determination.
As the demons of love, they could understand more fully than any others how noble that determination was...
".........Jessica‐san......"
"Furthermore, ......this magical miracle is something that can be received by you as well."
"By me too.........?
 Wh‐what......do you mean......?"
She had thought this had been about two pairs of lovers.
Beato was surprised to suddenly hear that this had something to do with her as well...
"With the miracle of the golden butterfly brooch,
 .........even your wish,
 ......that your affection for Battler will be acknowledged, can be granted easily.
 ......And without that miracle, you two will also...
............never be bound."
"..............."
"It means you\'re no outsider to this either."
"To cut across the marshes of love!
 That is your wish, is it not?!"
"We will not make light of your wish!"
"......Even your relationship with Battler will eventually fester and rot.
 ......Even you, with your optimistic attitude,
 ......must understand that this fate will eventually come to pass, barring some kind of miracle."
"...............Well........."
Beato hung her head sadly.
She wasn\'t about to let the cookie incident break her spirit.
......However, it would have been a massive lie to say that it hadn\'t hurt her...
The more she tried to get close to Battler, the more she hurt him.
However, she had been born in order to get close to Battler.
...She was like a hedgehog freezing in the cold and bunching together with others for warmth.
She had approached him because of love, and had been hurt for it......
"If you understand that much, entrusting your fate to a miracle may prove to be of some interest.
 As they say, an unbought lottery ticket earns you nothing.
 Zepar, Furfur!
 Let my little sister join in too."
"Oh, of course!"
"Welcome, second BEATRICE...!
 We were planning on including you from the very beginning!"
""After all, we are Zepar and Furfur!
 The demons of love!!""
"......I‐......is it alright if I......join in......?"
"If you want to, I don\'t see a problem.
 I won\'t prevent anyone from entering.
 We\'ll win against all hindrances and make everyone celebrate our union.
 ......Of course, it\'s the same the other way around.
 If you succeed in love by defeating us at our best,
 then both Shannon and I promise to sincerely support the pair that wins.
 Right, Shannon?"
"Yes.
 We will not lose.
 And even if we did, we would cheer you on from the bottom of our hearts."
"......I feel the same.
 I will not lose."
".........Well, if there\'s no way out of this fight,
 ......let\'s show \'em what we\'ve got.
 ......Neither I nor Kanon‐kun...
...have any intention of losing without a fight!"
"You feel the same, I assume?"
"Y‐......yes...
 ......If there is even a small chance that Father—
ah...
no...
......that Battler‐san will acknowledge me,
 I\'m willing to put myself on the line."
"Well said.
 Good going, little sister.
 Zepar, Furfur!
 The actors have gathered!"
"Then let\'s begin, Furfur!"
"Yes, let us begin, Zepar!"
""Let\'s begin this trial of lovers, the fight over a single miracle of magic...!!""
