As usual, this year\'s family conference was getting bogged down.
Everyone had decided to cool their heads for a moment, and a short break had been agreed upon...
The four siblings could say whatever they wanted,
 but Natsuhi and Kyrie, for example, were outsiders and found it difficult to speak freely in this sort of atmosphere.
A conference where you aren\'t allowed to say what you want can be tiring even as you just sit there quietly.
Even Kyrie couldn\'t help letting out a deep sigh...
".............................."
This was the second floor hallway of the mansion.
Rudolf had wanted to be alone during the break, so she had felt like doing the same...
...and had drifted up the stairs to reach this place.
Her expression was less tightly controlled than it was when her husband was around.
......Kyrie wore a tired look that she didn\'t often show.
She pressed her forehead against the cool window glass.
I need to regain my spirit and support my husband.
 Even if I\'m not allowed to speak.
......That\'s the duty I\'ve won.
".....................Who is it?"
She suddenly sensed another person, turned around,
 and saw Jessica standing at the other end of the hallway.
"..........................."
"Oh, it\'s you, Jessica-chan.
 ......Didn\'t you go to the guesthouse?"
"......Well,
 ......I just decided to head back to my own room for a bit to get a book."
"I see.
 And now you\'re on your way back to the guesthouse?"
"Y-yes.
 That\'s right......"
"What horrible rain.
 Is the wind really strong...?"
"It\'s weak right now, relatively speaking......"
As Kyrie looked out the window, ......Jessica watched her back, looking agitated...
"......Auntie Kyrie...
 ......I\'m sorry, you just had bad luck..."
"Ah, Zepar!
 Jessica\'s roulette of fate has chosen Kyrie!"
"What will you do, Jessica?!
 The roulette has chosen Kyrie, but you may reject that choice and spin the roulette again if you wish!"
""It doesn\'t matter whose life is sacrificed for this trial...!!""
Jessica wasn\'t like George.
George had willingly chosen Eva to be his sacrifice,
 to signify his separation from his old life so that he could step into a new life married to Shannon.
However, Jessica hadn\'t thought of any particular target.
......So, she had left it up to the roulette of fate.
That "roulette" was nothing very grandiose.
 ......She had simply walked around at random, imposing a rule on herself saying that the first person she met would be chosen as the sacrifice.
And so, ......the roulette of fate had brought her to Kyrie...
Of course, there was nothing forcing her to keep to that rule.
However, it was the rule that she had decided upon, and she didn\'t want to break it now.
......Now that she was participating in this demons\' game, this was the one bit of justice that she could cling to...
Right now, she could attack that unprotected back...
But Jessica still wasn\'t able to fully resolve herself.
"........................
 ......What is it?
 Do you have something to say to me...?"
Noticing Jessica\'s strange silence, Kyrie turned around.
......That unprotected back was already gone.
Jessica realized that her hesitation had cost her her own first chance...
......She had taken on this demons\' game to prove her love for Kanon.
However,
 ......would it really be alright to sell her soul to demons...
...for the sake of love...?
Not wanting to let George, who had already come to terms with the situation, get any more of a lead on her, she had energetically consented to this demons\' game, but...
......her heart still wasn\'t ready......
"Umm, ..................
 ......M-maybe I shouldn\'t be asking you this, Auntie Kyrie........."
"......What is it?
 It\'s rare for you to ask me questions, Jessica-chan.
 ......I hope I\'m capable of answering it for you."
"Actually, umm, ............I...
have someone I like."
"Oh, really?
 That\'s wonderful, *giggle*.
 Then is it love you wanted to talk about...?"
"E-......eheheh...
 ...Yeah, ......pretty much."
".........Alright.
 I\'ll help out if I can."
"Th-thank you very much...
 ......Actually, umm......"
"Is it still one-sided?"
"No, ......I guess you could say that it\'s just become mutual...
 But, well, .........there\'s this trial......for us to be joined together......"
"A trial?
 What are you talking about?"
"......There\'s the two of us and another pair of lovers......and we have to fight each other."
"A love triangle?
 Or a love rectangle...?
 Sounds complicated.
 ......And?"
"Only the pair who wins can be together...
 ......It\'s something complicated like that.
 So it\'s like, um - "
".........Sounds nasty.
 ......Love that can only succeed at another couple\'s expense."
"Yes...
 ......If we join up, ......then they\'ll fall apart.
 ......And the same the other way around."
"......I think I see where you\'re going with this.
 ......Something like this, right?
 "To what extent is a person allowed to climb over others in their own pursuit of happiness", ......right?"
".............................."
It was once again apparent......just how smart Kyrie was.
She immediately figured out the question that Jessica wanted to ask most...
"If you don\'t fight, it automatically means that they win and you lose.
 ......However, if you do fight and win, you cause the other pair to break apart.
 ......It\'s nasty either way.
 But the answer is obvious."
"............Yes......"
Kyrie giggled.
......If she wasn\'t willing to commit to her love, then that would show the measure of their relationship.
If that was the case, she should just let the other pair of lovers win.
However, if this was a love she couldn\'t abandon,
 ......she couldn\'t abandon the victory either.
So, ......she had no option but to fight.
In the end, Jessica\'s hesitation was caused by guilt...
over forcing the others to split apart as the result of her inevitable decision......
"......I guess...
......I\'m just...
...being soft after all......"
"Yep.
 ......That you are."
"...........................
 ......But stepping over someone else for the sake of my own love,
 ......it feels......horrible..."
"In that case, what about the one you love?
 ......Will you give up on them?"
"......That\'s......"
"I can tell you one thing for certain.
 Doing that would feel even worse.
 You\'ll be forced to crawl through hell.
 ......For the rest of your life."
A hardness had entered Kyrie\'s gaze...
"......I was just six, so I didn\'t understand much about it at the time,
 ......but I found Mom\'s notebook among her belongings after she died."
"Was it a diary...?"
"It was more a collection of her thoughts.
 It was much less organized than a diary would\'ve been.
 ......I found it and read it right after she passed away,
 ...but I needed to wait a long time, until I\'d grown for several years, before I could understand it."
".........I see.
 ...So, did it speak of Kyrie\'s worries about her marriage?"
"It was......practically a book of curses.
 ......It cleared up several things that six-year-old me had always vaguely sensed."
When I was six, it seemed as though my parents were very close and had no problems.
......And though I did think it odd that Onii-chan lived separately when he was meant to be part of our family,
 and I did wonder why he only came home every once in a while,
 I accepted it as the way things were.
"Did you not know about Asumu?"
"......I think Onii-chan talked to me about her when no one was around, but there was no way an elementary schooler like I was could understand.
 ......After all, I never even saw a picture of her.
 ......Mom had sent all of the pictures with Asumu-san in them to Onii-chan, leaving none behind in the house."
In front of Ange, and even in front of Battler who only rarely came home,
 ......Kyrie\'s smile never faltered.
If she hadn\'t written her thoughts in that notebook, Ange would probably never have known them.
Rudolf had been particularly popular with the opposite sex since his school days - a typical playboy.
Audacious, over the top, and yet not lacking a little gentleness towards women,
 he had probably built up a formula for getting women to like him.
Plenty of women approached him, using various seductive tricks to try to win his favor.
Rudolf probably enjoyed that more than anyone.
Since the beginning, love had been a game to Rudolf.
He never thought of it as a trial and error process to find a single life partner.
He would intentionally spark jealousy between women and revel in the harem, lapping up their flirting.
......He may be my father, ......but he was an awful man.
"But at the same time, Dad must have looked down on those toadying girls.
 ......Mom, who had her own set of values and was extremely intelligent, must have stood out."
"......Though even that might have been due to the skillful way Kyrie tried to catch Rudolf\'s gaze."
"...........................
 ......Yeah, maybe.
 Mom was smart in many ways."
Like the other Ushiromiya siblings, Rudolf had strong ambitions and lofty goals.
Under the mottos of "who dares wins" and "it\'s not a crime if you don\'t get caught",
 he would set up businesses that were borderline swindles or bending the law, then bail out of them, and repeat that process over and over.
Apparently, he was already making use of that talent in his college years, cleverly making money by thinking up shameless projects and selling cheap tickets to parties for them,
 so much money that he could brag about how his wallet was always stuffed with a hundred 10,000 yen notes......
Many women fell for his charisma in being the man responsible for these radical projects, ...as well as his thick wallet and generosity.
......It would be a lie to say that Kyrie was not one of them.
However, what made Kyrie very different from the other women...
...was that she could also support Rudolf as a business partner.
Rudolf would laugh all the way to the bank as his large-scale party succeeded.
 His female entourage would surround him.
And Kyrie would be the only one among them able to calmly point out several ways that income and expenditure could be improved upon,
 and even lay out a proposal for the next project.
"In that manner, ......Rudolf must have slowly begun to accept her as a partner."
".........Just like some people say men don\'t belong in the kitchen,
 ......there\'s also a sense that women should stay out of financial affairs.
 ......It\'s "normal" for women to be treated by men.
 ...The details of how those 10,000 yen notes were scrounged up are vulgar, so they don\'t ask, don\'t know, don\'t even care."
"So, you\'re saying that Kyrie viewed money from a man\'s perspective..."
In that regard, Rudolf noticed something unique about Kyrie.
He knew all about how much hard work it took to make just one of those 10,000 yen notes.
So, somewhere inside him, he looked down upon those extravagant women who never even considered the efforts he had undertaken.
......Among all of them, only Kyrie possessed the same sharp financial intuition as Rudolf...
Every time Rudolf thought of a new plan, he would talk to Kyrie about it, work out the kinks, and make it succeed.
In this way, Kyrie steadily worked her way up until she was the number one of Rudolf\'s large group of followers.
"But Mom was still a woman.
 ......I doubt she enjoyed seeing Dad pampered by all the other girls."
"......So, she would rather have been his only one, instead of his number one..."
"Yeah.
 Though she served as Dad\'s right hand, she slyly got rid of the other women in the shadows.
 ......It was only a matter of time before Mom would succeed in her love."
"When did Asumu come into the picture?"
"......She was one of those who swarmed around Rudolf-san.
 ...No, not even that.
 She was just one of his fans."
"Did you ever talk with her...?"
"Of course.
 ......I knew her well.
 Ever since the very beginning, before Rudolf-san even knew her name.
 .........I\'m sure she was quite intelligent herself.
 And cunning.
 ......I tried to use my intelligence to stick out, .........but she took the exact opposite approach."
"......By her...stupidity......?"
"*giggle*...
 .........I mean she was good at triggering his protective instinct.
 Out of all the girls who came to flatter and flirt with him,
 ......only she stood out with every action she made, unlike the flashy girls Rudolf-san had tired of."
......Even now, Kyrie recognized the mistake she had made in letting Asumu and Rudolf get too close.
Kyrie had thought that by taking the role of his business partner, she had succeeded in making him entirely hers.
......She might have been a little conceited.
And her arrogance in trying to eliminate the relationships the other girls had with Rudolf might also have contributed.
Perhaps she sometimes tried too hard as a business partner,
 putting too much pressure on him, regardless of the fact that it was justified.
Bit by bit, Rudolf started to need a woman who could stay quiet and soothe him,
 ......without making him think about anything complicated.
.........That woman was Asumu.
"I am ruthless and intellectual.
 Rational and economical.
 ......In a plank of Carneades situation, I would push the other person off without hesitation.
 ......I thought that was the kind of partner suitable for him."
However, though that ruthlessness had made her reliable on the business side of things...
......outside of business,
 it might have disturbed Rudolf deeply.
At some point, ......though Rudolf still acknowledged Kyrie\'s skill, he began to yearn for a quiet, warm acceptance.
Asumu filled that role completely.
She would never talk about anything complicated.
Even if he did, she would just shake her head to say she didn\'t know.
However, she would care more for him physically than anyone else, quietly putting a blanket on him and staying by his side until morning...
"......Yes, I did get the position of his business partner.
 ......But before I knew it,
 ......Rudolf-san had grown a need for a mental partner, someone who could heal his heart.
 Foolishly enough, despite claiming to be the intellectual one, I never noticed."
"............And then...
...Uncle Rudolf...
married Aunt Asumu......?"
".................................
 ...Yes, that\'s right.
 She stole him away from me."
"........................"
"He had slept with a lot of women.
 ......By that point, he wasn\'t the kind of guy to let his emotions be captured by a woman just because he slept with her.
 After all, sleeping with women was just a game to him.
 .........That\'s why I used something other than my body to attract his attention."
"......Conceit.
 A woman\'s downfall..."
"Before long, they were both pregnant.
 ......Asumu-san told Dad about it right away, but Mom did the opposite."
".........She must have been afraid that pregnancy would threaten her position as his business partner..."
"Apparently, Mom wasn\'t eating much at the time and was often out of sorts.
 Because of that, it took a really long time before she realized she was pregnant."
"When did she notice...?"
"......It was after Asumu-san suddenly moved into Dad\'s family register.
 ......Mom learned about her pregnancy after that and plotted several times to split Asumu-san and Dad apart, but..."
"Even though Asumu-san.........always appeared to be so absentminded,
 ...once she got her hands on Rudolf-san, she wouldn\'t let go.
 ......\'What do you want? Please stay out of our way\', she\'d say.
 ......And this coming from that sissy little girl who\'d curl up into a ball every time she got on a bus."
".........At that point, I realized.
 ...She had been the truly cunning one.
 ......Yes, even her fear of vehicles was another lie to catch Rudolf-san\'s sympathy.
 ..............."
".....................My apologies.
 I must be boring you."
"Oh, ......no........."
"At the very least,
 I wanted him to register himself as the father of my child.
 ......And it does seem as though Rudolf-san was prepared to do that.
 He made sure there was a hospital waiting for me, and even though Asumu-san was close to giving birth herself, he gallantly came to see me.
 .........Even though she was already his wife.
 What an awful man, really......"
After that......is the tale I can\'t bear even to tell.
Both Asumu and I......had the same delivery date.
And yet, her pregnancy led to marriage, ......while mine was completely meaningless.
I swore to bring up my child well, so that Rudolf-san would be proud to call himself its father.
Asumu-san had won her battle against me.
......However, I hadn\'t yet lost the war.
If I could make my child excel far more than Asumu-san\'s,
 if I could make my child the one that Rudolf-san most respected, I would be rewarded.
 .........That\'s what I believed.
"However, ......Kyrie\'s child was stillborn."
"Yeah.
 ......Asumu-san gave birth to Onii-chan.
 ......But Mom didn\'t give birth to anyone.
 ......Even Mom\'s final hope of being left a spot as Dad\'s second wife...was destroyed......"
Kyrie had fallen from his partner to his second wife,
 ......and then, unable to give birth to the bond of a child, ......she tumbled down......to being merely his mistress.
I can\'t imagine...
...how much she must have hated Asumu and her child, ...Battler.
"......But despite that,
 ......Mom was able to act in a very friendly way towards Onii-chan.
 .........It was definitely a shock for me.
 To discover that my kind and gentle mother had held such negative emotions towards Onii-chan......and managed to hide them."
"........................
 ......She must have despised Battler."
"I don\'t doubt it.
 ......If Asumu-san\'s child had been stillborn and Mom had been the one to give birth to Onii-chan,
 ......history might have changed in some way.
 It seems she thought that if that had happened,
 she might have been able to make things play out in a way that Dad would divorce Asumu-san and marry her instead."
".........Was that...also written in that book where she kept her thoughts?"
"Yeah.
 ......It truly was a collection of random thoughts, fantasies.
 .........Mom\'s resentment, as she chewed on the corner of her tear-stained bed sheets."
"There\'s just one thing I regret."
".........You mean...the pregnancy?"
"No, no.
 .........It\'s my arrogance I regret.
 ".........Rudolf-san is already mine, so I\'m completely safe.
 ......I\'ll never lose to that Asumu girl.""
"......While she was screaming and shrieking on buses and planes, I was capable of properly managing the travel arrangements and expenditures.
 ......And so, I was overly confident......that I was the one Rudolf-san trusted the most."
"........................"
"They say love needs to be nurtured, right?"
"Y-......yeah."
"That\'s not wrong.
 ......You both need to water that tree, care for it, and nurture it.
 ......And at the end, it will finally bear the fruit called love.
 Did you know?
 It isn\'t over when it bears fruit.
 ......You have to harvest that love, or it will never be realized."
".........Harvest......?"
"You need to think about that yourself, Jessica-chan.
 ......If you make the tree bear fruit without harvesting it, it can sometimes grow rotten.
 And bugs will often gather around it.
 In fact, ......sometimes thieves will come by and pluck it off the branch."
"..........................."
"Young kids like you, Jessica-chan, think that love ends with nurturing.
 ......That\'s naive.
 ......If you don\'t harvest it, you will never be rewarded for your love."
"Harvest......love......"
"At a glance, it may seem to be a matter just for the pair of lovers, but that isn\'t true.
 Putting off the harvest because you assume you can do it at any time just gives the thieves a chance."
"......What if that fruit you\'ve worked so hard to nurture gets pulled off the branch the next morning?
 ......You\'ll regret that you didn\'t choose to harvest it the previous day instead of putting it off.
 ......That regret really hurts.
 ......It\'ll make you crawl through hell."
"........................"
"I was lucky.
 My hell ended after 18 years.
 ......So, I\'ll never misjudge myself again.
 ......That man is mine.
 I won\'t let him get away. I won\'t let him out of my sight.
 And I\'m grateful to my masters.........
for giving me that chance.
 My "absolute, certain willpower" in not giving up on that man no matter what was answered with a "miracle"."
By now, Jessica was speechless......and didn\'t even nod her head in understanding.
......This true form of love that Kyrie was telling her about...
was far, far more harsh than anything she had imagined...
"Now,
 ......I will do anything to keep Rudolf-san by my side.
 And I will show no mercy to his enemies.
 ......If he wished it, I might not even hesitate to commit murder."
".........Because I finally gained that determination, on the 18th year,
 .........that absolute willpower...
...brought about a miracle for me.
 .........You know, miracles only come to those who can make them come true themselves."
Asumu\'s death was no murder.
However, Kyrie had often cursed her and hoped for her death,
 ......and finally, on the 18th year, she built up the determination to kill her with her own hands.
And then, ......she actually......got herself a knife with which to do the deed.........
That was when the miracle occurred......
"......Aunt Asumu passing away......was a miracle......?"
"Not really.
 ......That wasn\'t even close to a miracle."
"............Huh?"
"After all,
 ......if she hadn\'t died, I would have killed her.
 ......In other words, she was fated to die no matter what.
 ......The miracle was that, even though she did die,
 I didn\'t have to get my hands dirty.
 That\'s all."
......Until now, Kyrie had never shown Jessica...
......no, she had never even shown Rudolf...that glint in the deepest depths of her eyes.
It told plainly and clearly...
that romance and love are not the sweet and fluffy candies that young girls imagine them to be.
Jessica was overwhelmed by that pressure......and stunned silent.
And she had to acknowledge it.
This was.........the power of will that could make love be realized.
This was the level of willpower Kyrie showed in her support of Rudolf as his wife.
And it was the same for George.
......He already had the willpower to confront everything in the way of his love that transcended status,
 and he had proven that.
Now, ......Jessica could clearly understand.
This was the magnitude of George\'s determination,
 which had allowed him to coldly carry out his part of the demons\' trial...
Then, ......what about her.........?
Did she really have the resolve to make her love with Kanon bear fruit...
and to go through with the task of harvesting it.........?
"*giggle*, I\'m sorry.
 I only meant to give a little advice, but perhaps I scared you a little too much.
 ......*giggle*giggle*.
 Blame the weather.
 I just wanted to pressure you a bit, but I\'ve gone overboard."
Kyrie let a relaxed smile rise to her face.
The tense atmosphere finally slackened.
......However, her words had been gouged into Jessica\'s heart.
"I don\'t know what your love has been like, Jessica-chan,
 .........but if you have a rival and neither is willing to back down, you can\'t let yourself become complacent."
"......If you do, you\'ll end up like me.
 ............Every woman should have one time in her life...
when she would kill for the sake of love.
 ......I can tell you that all women in the world who call themselves mothers have been through that.
 After all..."
"Women who don\'t do that are chewed to bits by the others and forced to crawl through the hell of envy and regret for the rest of their lives.
 .........My hell lasted 18 years.
 ......I was lucky to be pardoned after just 18.
 ......That hell is still filled with women......who will never get out until they die.
 ......Unless they execute themselves in their regret."
"........................
 ......Wow, I......I have no words."
"*giggle*.
 ......I was trying to spur you on, but here I\'ve gone and frightened you too much.
 ...I\'m truly sorry.
 ......Love can be much more easygoing than that, okay?
 Love really is like playing with fire.
 Anyone can play easily and lightheartedly.
......But when you mess up and get burned, that scar stays with you your whole life.
 .........*giggle*giggle*giggle*."
Regrets in love will never fade.
That was all that Kyrie had been trying to communicate.
......It wasn\'t like Kyrie to tell her life story instead of just saying something like that directly - in fact, her past was a topic she usually avoided.
However, ......Kyrie might have felt as though Jessica deserved to hear.
Jessica had timidly brought up the subject of love.
......Perhaps Kyrie had opened up and told everything...
...because she had seen the fires of Jessica\'s determination in her eyes.
"Well, I\'d better head back.
 ......Let\'s keep what we\'ve talked about a secret, okay?
 Eheheheh..."
With a mysterious smile on her face, Kyrie turned around.
.........I wonder if I scared her too much.
Still, it\'s a hundred times better to learn of that hell from a warning.
......Once you\'ve fallen into it, it\'s already too late.
Good luck, Jessica-chan.
Your love sounds like a handful, but don\'t let yourself be beaten.
Eheheh, it\'s not every day I get to act as a mentor...
"......Hmm?
 What is it, Jessica-chan...?"
What - 
A windstorm grazed Kyrie\'s head.
It had missed by a hair.
If Kyrie hadn\'t twisted her body slightly, that fist would probably have been buried in her face by now.
A bitter smile rose to Jessica\'s face when she saw that her first strike had failed to land a kill...
"Just so you know, I didn\'t try to sucker punch you because I\'m a dirty coward...
 ......I hoped to end it with a single painless strike before you realized what was happening..."
".........Didn\'t I tell you that I\'ve lived through the hell of jealousy?
 I\'ve come close to getting stabbed in the back a couple times before.
 I know how it feels just before a surprise attack."
"You mean you could sense it...?"
"That, plus the lie you told in the beginning."
"......A lie?"
"Come now.
 If you had come from your room after picking up a book and were on your way back to the guesthouse, you wouldn\'t have come through this hallway in that direction.
 ......Chessboard theory led me to seven possible reasons you might have had for lying,
 and this was the worst-case scenario."
Telling a hasty lie to Kyrie would only put her on her guard.
If Jessica hadn\'t told that lie, her surprise attack would have succeeded.
".........Not bad.
 ......I should have expected that from you, ...Auntie Kyrie."
"Why me?
 You were planning to kill me from the beginning."
"It didn\'t matter who it was."
"Just my luck."
"It\'s what you said that gave me the boost I needed.
 .........Thanks a lot......"
".........Wha............?!"
Kyrie dodged the punch, placed her hand against that fist, and slammed it against the wall.
Ordinarily, being made to punch the wall should have caused Jessica to hurt her own hand...
...and roll around clutching it in pain...
However, Jessica\'s fist...
...had left what looked like a meter-wide crater in the wall.
Instead of a look of anguish after smashing her fist against the wall,
 Jessica clicked her tongue in irritation at having missed...
"......Incredible.
 I see that you are your father\'s daughter.
 Have you taken up boxing too...?"
Impossible... Jessica is barehanded.
She isn\'t holding any sort of weapon at all...!
"............Please don\'t resist, Auntie.
 Just one strike to the head...
 I promise you won\'t feel a thing."
Kyrie tried to look confident, but she couldn\'t hide her confusion at this unreal destructive force.
If that punch had hit, her head probably would have split open like Jessica had said, killing her without any pain.
"Here I come........."
".........!!!"
If Kyrie\'s kick off the ground and leap backward had been an instant slower, her gut would probably have been pulverized.
Though she had avoided it by a hair,
 Jessica\'s left body blow was followed by a terrible tornado-like gust of wind, which blew Kyrie back.
"......Is this a dream?
 Am I still sleeping?!
 I...I don\'t understand!"
This Jessica looked like the normal Jessica, but something was different...!
It wasn\'t human, and common sense didn\'t apply to it!
This had to be......some kind of nightmare...!!
Kyrie slowly stood up.
Then, she looked at Jessica, noticed the several meters between them...
and realized just how far that blast of wind had sent her flying.
"..................Feel free to hate me.
 ...But...
......just like you,
 ......I can\'t back down.
 .........I can\'t let...
...my love...
...finish half-hearted."
".........What are you talking about...?
 What are you saying?! What on Earth is going on?!
 Someone, tell meeeeeeeeee!!!"
The air around Jessica seemed to bend like a heat wave.
It seemed to be enshrouding her fists.
 ......And, it seemed as though something like a red magic circle had appeared beneath her feet.
She looked just like a Western demon standing amidst the flames of hell.
"...Flame upgrade.
 ......Mass upgrade.
 ......Armor-piercing upgrade."
Each time Jessica muttered, her fists were surrounded by a pulsating, sinister, red light.
......Those fists, which were even giving off smoke,
 surely represented...
......the iron hammers of hell wielded by demons...
"G-goodbye!! This is just a nightmare...!!"
Kyrie dashed away with lightning speed.
Yes - right now, that was her best option.
She was smart enough to realize that pinching her cheek wasn\'t the best way to wake up from this nightmare, and by now, this came as no surprise.
"......Ronove."
When Jessica muttered once more, a blood-red magical barrier blocked off the corridor.
Kyrie slammed into it hard and realized that her path of escape had been cut off.
"Gah,
 ......st-
......stop this, this...madness...!!
 This is...
......a nightmare,
 ......it\'s a nightmare...
 ......Let me wake up...
......quickly......!"
"......Yeah, this is a nightmare......
 .........I\'ll wake you up right now, if that\'s what you want.
 .........Just one strike... Don\'t move......"
Jessica slowly stepped forward towards her, enshrouded in flames...
Each time her feet lifted off the floor......boiling steam hung around her footprints...
This was......a true nightmare......
 ......Kyrie clutched her head in her hands, shaking it over and over again......
"It\'s a nightmare, right......?
 This is......a nightmare, isn\'t it.........?
 Please, tell me it is......!!"
"Yeah, it\'s a nightmare."
"It is, right...?
 It\'s a nightmare, right......?
 Ah, ......aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahh!!"
"I\'ll recognize that.
 ......This is a nightmare."
"I do too!!
 I recognize that this is a nightmare!! S-so please - "
"I\'ll wake you up......with a single punch!
 Rrrraaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhh!!!"
"Ack.........ggha...gh...............kh...??"
Jessica\'s neck twisted at an odd angle,
 ......and she staggered backwards, her eyes rolled back into her head,
 as though she didn\'t have a clue what had just happened.
A demon stake......was buried at an angle into her forehead.
It pulled itself out of her, spun around, then became Leviathan and landed.
The hole left behind in Jessica\'s head spewed blood.
"Leviathan the Envious, right here......!"
"If this is inside a nightmare anyway, .........why not have the friend that shows up in my nightmares?
 My friend from the hell of envy.
 Thanks for showing up just in the nick of time."
"......It\'s too early to thank me.
 She\'s......not down yet...!!"
".........Gah............gah......"
Even though she had taken a deep gouge to the top of the head,
 ......Jessica just stood there, convulsing and white-eyed, and didn\'t fall over.
The blood stopped pouring out of her forehead, ......and her blank, doll-like eyes returned.
Then, she slowly pressed her own palm against the wound in her forehead.
 ......There was a sizzle, as though she had pressed a hot iron against it.
It was easy to imagine that she was doing this to seal up the wound.
If Kyrie didn\'t escape now, there would never be another chance...!
"Can you defeat her...?!"
"Impossible.
 ......She has a contract with one of the Great Demons... She\'s immortal...!"
"That is because of love!!
 That is why she is immortal!!"
"Yes, love is magnificent!
 Those with our blessings cannot be killed!!"
"Can we break that red magic wall?"
"Ronove-sama is also a Great Demon.
 There\'s nothing I can do...!"
"Can we escape out of a window?"
"The windows are no good either!
 They were blocked by Ronove-sama\'s barrier a while ago...!"
"Incredible. Does this mean she sold her soul to demons for the sake of love?"
"How could she make so many contracts with Great Demons...?!
 Aah, I\'m so jealous...!!"
".................................
 ......Armor upgrade.
 ......All-attribute defense,
 counter-attacking armor upgrade."
In response to these words, this time her entire body pulsated with a red light.
......She had upgraded herself with a defensive power that would ensure Leviathan\'s attacks would never work again......
"What is she talking about...?"
"......Self-augmentation.
 It\'s a kind of enchantment.
 ......Right now, she has enough defensive power to prevent me from piercing her,
 and she even has the power to reflect the damage back upon the attacker!
 ......She\'s no longer Human. She\'s a monster...!!"
"Oh, so that\'s all.
 Then not much has changed."
"How can you say that?"
"Just like in the very beginning, we still have no chance of winning...!!"
"..............................
 ............That hurt.
 ......But it won\'t...work again."
Jessica slowly...
...lifted the hand that had been covering her forehead...
...and there was no longer any hole there.
The hall was blocked by barriers in both directions, and even the windows were sealed.
 There was no way out.
"Is the door to this room sealed?"
"No, it\'s just locked.
 ......But it\'s just a normal room.
 It does have windows, but they\'ve already been sealed.
 In other words, that\'s a locked room, and a coffin for us...!"
"A coffin is just what I need. Unlock it.
 ......Aah, I\'m jealous, why are you the only one who can unlock it?!!!"
Leviathan\'s stake flew about at high speeds, ramming itself into the keyhole to that room.
The tip of the stake had become a key.
 As soon as it was unlocked, the door flew open.
Both of them fell into the room and quickly locked it.
This was probably...Krauss\'s study.
Its soothing furnishings brought about a sense of nobility that Krauss would probably like.
"Even if you lock it, she can just smash through it with one punch!!
 You\'ve just put the lid on your own coffin!!"
"However, if she wants to send us a killing blow here inside this coffin, she\'ll have to take the lid off first!"
".....................?"
With dim eyes, Jessica tilted her head upon hearing Kyrie\'s words.
"............What are you talking about...?
 ......How will such a small room...be able to protect you...?"
"This room may be a locked room.
 It may leave us with no method of escape.
 However, even you can\'t break into this room.
 That\'s what a locked room is!"
"......What are you talking about......?
 How does this tiny room,
 ......with its tiny door, make you think you\'ve gotten away from me......?"
With a confused expression on her face,
 Jessica looked wearily between her own burning fists and the door.
Then, slowly, ......she sent that pulsating, red light to her fists......
She repeatedly enchanted her fists to give them the destructive power for the killing blow.
"......I\'ll smash this door to bits........."
"If you think you can,
 give it a try."
"K-Kyrieeeeeee......!!"
Responding calmly through the door, which was the only thing separating her from Jessica, Kyrie placed a single index finger on it as if to hold it shut.
Jessica slowly...
...raised a fire-wreathed demonic fist......
"......So long, Auntie Kyrie......"
"Kyrieeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!
 ....................................?!?!"
"...............Oh........."
Jessica\'s fist slammed into the door in slow motion.
It was the same kind of slow motion often seen as a special effect at the climax of a movie.
However, this was no special effect.
......Jessica\'s fist really was...slowing down as though it was being sucked in......like a spoon sinking into a jar of honey.
That punch...was no longer a punch.
 It was no more than a knock.
"I\'m envious of you."
"...............Envy......"
"I crawled through the hell of envy for 18 years because of my arrogance and naivety in love.
 ......So I envy you.
 ......You\'re going to remember my warning, succeed in love, and walk a beautiful life, right......?"
"...........................Hah..."
"......Aah, I envy you.
 You\'ll get to live through the most beautiful time in a woman\'s life...for a full 18 years longer than I did.
 ...Aah, I envy you so much...!!"
Jessica tried to slam her fists against the door over and over again.
However, as soon as her fist approached it, its speed plummeted.
She could barely knock, much less smash the door...!
"............Speed upgrade.
 ......Instantaneous force upgrade.
 ......Speed of sound upgrade."
"It\'s useless, darling."
"......Break............!!!!"
With full speed upgrades, Jessica\'s fist moved at the speed of sound, 1,225 km/h.
However, how long had Jessica been in envy to gain that speed?
She had started to envy George and Shannon\'s relationship about......two years ago?
2*365=730 days,
 730*24=17,520 hours.
However, she wasn\'t envious all the time.
It only happened when Shannon started going on about George.
With Shannon\'s shift on about 3 days of the week, /7*3.
And it wasn\'t as though she would go on about George all day long.
Her fond words for him would only leave a mark on Jessica for about......an hour?
So only one 24th of each day.
17520/7*3/24=312 (rounded down).
The number of hours that Kyrie had been jealous was 157,680.
 In other words, this was a scant 0.2% of the time that Kyrie had been jealous.
Even 1225 km/h, the speed of sound, becomes only 2.45 km/h in the 1/500 world.
"......Understand?
 ......You\'re lacking in both love and envy."
"..................!!!"
Even Jessica\'s sonic fists...
...were no faster than a walking child in Kyrie\'s world.
Jessica ground her teeth, her fist still pressed against the door.
If someone could have seen this from both sides of the door, it would have looked as though Kyrie was holding it shut with a single finger...
"Way to go, Kyrie...!!!"
"See? This room is a locked room.
 At most, Jessica-chan can knock on the door, but she can\'t lay a finger on us inside!"
"Ah, BEATRICE\'s definition of a locked room."
".........What the hell...?"
"Then this locked room will be somewhat troublesome.
 It is impossible for a Human to carry out a locked-room murder.
 ......Only magic can do that.
 ......Until you truly understand magic, you will not be able to break through it."
"You can\'t corner me any further...!
 As time passes, the relatives will eventually realize that I haven\'t returned, and they\'ll start searching the mansion.
 And then, you will be observed.
 Witches and magic alike disappear when they\'re observed.
 .........The nightmare is already over, darling!!!"
"......D-......damn...it..............."
"Oh?!
 I can\'t believe Jessica is going to drop out all of a sudden!!"
"Oh, please give it your all!
 Do it for your beloved Kanon!!"
""Come, Jessica, believe in love and let us see a miracle!!""
"Let me make a correction.
 There isn\'t even any need to wait for time to pass.
 ......After all, there\'s an extension telephone right here.
 Of course, the internal phone line hasn\'t been cut."
"......I\'ll just...pick up...
......the receiver!!
 This is...my...
......checkmate!!!"
".........Construction completed.
 .........Locked-room murder."
"......Aha.
 ......Yes, that is valid."
".........Permeation upgrade.
 .........Attack transmission,
 indirect attack power upgrade."
"Huh..............."
Jessica\'s fist, which was pressed against the door, glowed red...and then white hot...
Jessica didn\'t even swing her fist.
She just kept it pressed against the door.
However, ......Jessica\'s "murder" reached inside the "locked room"......
Through the cracks in the study door, through the keyhole...burst the flames of hell.
Jessica couldn\'t see what was happening inside the room.
......However, even here, on the other side of the door, she could tell that the flames of hell had swallowed the entire room.
"Ggh...
......gyah...
.........gah...
............"
Kyrie\'s smoldering death throes could be heard from across the door.
Jessica clearly heard as Kyrie danced a dance of death amidst the hellfire,
 ......fell to her knees,
 ......and slumped over to the floor.
Slowly, ......Jessica tore her burning fist away from the door.
".........If you love the hell of envy so much,
 then burn.
 ......Burn in the flames of envy...for all time.
 .........There are probably some things that can be learned from envy.
 However, it\'s nothing to be praised, and it\'s no one\'s duty.
 ............It seems you were too proud after all,
 ......Auntie Kyrie."
"......A splendid......locked-room murder."
"Could you take care of the mess?
 .........I\'d hate for her body to be burnt to a crisp when it\'s finally found.
 ......Do you think you could clean it up...?"
"As you wish, Milady."
Ronove transformed into a gold butterfly and entered Krauss\'s study through the keyhole.
......Then, he had to cross his arms and think...
...about how he should even start cleaning up Kyrie\'s unrecognizable corpse and this room that had ended up as a burning hell...
"....................................
 ......Haaah.........haah..."
Jessica finally let out the breath that she had been holding down in her chest...
Her normal Human glint finally returned to her eyes...
......And then, ...she couldn\'t help but shudder at what she had done,
 ......even if it had been just a trial on the game board for the sake of her love...
"......Is that what you wanted, demons?!"
""Yes, well done, Jessica!
 Your love is the real deal!!""
"........................"
George welcomed Jessica with crisp applause.
......Beato timidly tried to join him, but Jessica yelled at them and she stopped.
"......It\'s just something that happened on the game board.
 There\'s no need to look so sad about it."
"I know that logically!!
 But still, ......how am I supposed to just accept it emotionally?!!"
".........Milady - "
"Kanon-kun, ......I...love you...!
 I can\'t give up...!!
 That\'s why I\'ve shown how strong my feelings are...!
 I...didn\'t do something wrong, did I?
 I\'m not wrong, am I?!
 Uuu...aaaaaaaaaaaahh......"
"...............Milady..."
As Jessica started to sob, ...Kanon held her quietly.
And he realized that he would have to carry on the determination she had shown him...
"You didn\'t make any mistake.
 ......And it also isn\'t a mistake to keep your human heart and be sad.
 ......I just happen to be a bit more of a stoic when it comes to that sort of thing."
"......Not everyone can match up to George-sama\'s level.
 ......But, in any event, you have completed your trial, Milady.
 ......Well done. I admire the strength of your determination."
"Hmm, very true.
 Both George and Jessica...
have splendidly succeeded just the same.
 Very impressive, Jessica!
 ......That "locked-room murder" just now was wonderful enough to fascinate even a witch like myself."
Jessica had used "magic" to kill Kyrie, who had holed up inside a closed room.
In that instant, Jessica had "constructed" a locked-room murder,
 had it acknowledged by the demons, and raised it to the level of magic...
"The trials for the two of you have been completed!!"
"So then, who will take the next challenge?!"
"Will it be BEATRICE-sama?!"
"No, no, it might be Shannon!"
"No, this has to be Kanon\'s time to shine!"
""Come, speak up!!
 Who is next?! Who will take the next trial?!""
".....................nn - "
"What witch would hesitate at committing murder on the game board?
 Even excess shyness can kill love."
"..........................."
"Come!! Who will be next - "
"To carry out a murder of love?!"
"....................."
".................."
"............nn - "
The three who remained looked at each other.
......\'If the other two are going to spend a few more moments hesitating to raise their hands, I will raise my own instead.\'
......All three thought this at the same time.
So,
 they all raised their hands at the same time.
......The ones they loved had already shown their determination.
They had to carry on.
