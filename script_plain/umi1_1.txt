".........Should\'ve taken the boat...
......the boat......"
"Gonna faaalll!
 Gonna faaalll!
 Uu‐uu‐uu‐uu!!"
"Maria, that\'s enough!"
"......But what a surprise.
 I thought there was nothing that could scare Battler‐kun."
"This guy can\'t handle vehicles for some reason.
 Always yells about falling and sinking and stuff.
 You\'re a disgrace of a man, you are."
"......Urgh, shut up.
 That thing was seriously shaking way too much...
 I just got a little stressed, since it was my first time on a small plane like that..."
"You call that "a little stressed"?
 Heheheh, sounds like it\'d be fun to take an overseas vacation with you, Battler‐kun.
 Would you like to go to Egypt with your aunt?
 You\'d get to ride a plane for a full 14 hours!"
"Ahhahaha!
 There\'s a good plan.
 Battler‐kun, you should go let Eva nee‐san toughen you up some.
 But boy were you hilarious!
 Ahhahahaha!"
"Wahhahaha, now, now. Everyone\'s got their own strong and weak points.
 It\'s bad to laugh at \'em.
 Wahhahaha...!"
"D‐Dad, you\'re laughing too.
 Hey, Maria‐chan, you shouldn\'t laugh anymore."
"Shouldn\'t laugh anymore?
 Uu!"
Gyah, dammit!
 Is being scared of planes really such a big deal?
{n}Everyone obviously thinks I\'m a big oaf now...
 Tch!
We split up and took separate taxis from the airport to the harbor.
{n}From there on, we would be taking a boat to the island.
The islands are right next to each other, so it\'s not that far.
{n}It would be a leisurely thirty minutes by boat.
As we arrived at the pier where the boat to the island was anchored, we saw a silhouette waving its hand.
"George nii‐saaan!
 It\'s been so frickin\' long!!"
"Ah, Jessica‐chan, it\'s been a year since I saw you!
 You\'ve gotten taller again, haven\'t you?"
"Kyahaha, don\'t gimme that, it\'s embarrassing hearing that every year!"
"......H‐hey, Aniki, you\'ve gotta be kidding me.
 That\'s really Jessica?!"
"Wait a sec, George nii‐san...
 This massive beast...
is Battler?!"
We both stared each other down.
...She definitely didn\'t look this grown‐up in my memories, but I do remember her {c:86EF9C:crazy way of talking}.
"Yo, Jessica!
 What\'s this now!
 You\'re kidding me, you look like a woman now!
 What\'re these, boobs? Even you managed to get a chest!
 Ihihi, let me rub \'em, let me~!"
"Hey, screw you, I\'m a blushing flower of 18!
 Just like hair grows out, so\'ll other stuff!
 You think I got boobs just so you can go and rub \'em, loser?!
 And what about you, got anything to back up that ridiculous size?!
 Did you remember to grow any actual muscle?!"
"You\'d better believe it, I\'ll show you how much training I\'ve piled up since back then!!"
"Oh, cram it!!
 I\'ll beat you at your own game!"
This headstrong girl\'s name is Ushiromiya {p:0:朱志香}.
......She was born under the same unlucky star as me, sharing the same kind of weird name.
 You see, {p:0:朱志香} is pronounced "Jessica".
She\'s Dad\'s older brother\'s daughter.
That older brother happens to be the eldest son of the Ushiromiya family, so I guess that also technically makes Jessica a direct heir to the Ushiromiya family.
Since Jessica and I are the same age and had that type of boy‐girl rivalry between us,
 we\'ve always been used to fighting and joking around together whenever the relatives gathered.
Jessica grew more quickly, so she always had me beat in terms of size and physical strength.
So, when we scuffled as a contest of strength like this, it usually went Jessica\'s way.
So even though I clearly understand that I\'m bigger now, I still feel like I can\'t win against Jessica with my strength.
"Hnng! Ghhh......!!"
"............Woh...ah...!
 What the...what\'re you...getting all serious for...?!
 Owowow..."
"Hey hey hey, this is nothin\'!
 Jessica, you\'ve gotten weak."
"Sh‐shut up.
 I\'m a woman over here, believe it or not.
 No way I was always gonna be stronger than a man!"
"We~ll, that\'s certainly true!
 The meat I put on my arms all went to your chest, after a~ll.
 It looks like it\'d be a pretty even test of strength between my arms and your boobs, don\'t you thi~nk?!"
"I told you, my boobs aren\'t for you to feel up!!
 Besides, how \'bout you—your height says you\'re an adult, but what about your other places, huh?!"
"Stop it, idiot, nooo, I\'ll be ruuuuined for marriage, don\'t touch me in strange placeees!!"
"D‐don\'t say stuff people are gonna misinterpret!!"
Honestly, I was so surprised at how feminine Jessica had become that I had to seriously horse around to hide it.
......Well yeah, considering what a bossy brat she was six years ago, anyone would be surprised.
And I guess she\'s just as surprised.
{n}She definitely wasn\'t expecting she\'d lose to me in a test of strength.
After losing that easily, she must be shocked at how much I\'ve grown in the past six years.
.........Six years.
 Once again, I\'m being shown just what a huge gap of time that was.
"Crap...total defeat.
 It\'s like I\'m no match for you anymore."
"That\'s not true.
 Even Battler‐kun must have his weaknesses.
 Right, Maria‐chan?"
"Uu!
 Gonna faaall gonna faaall!!"
"Ghhk—Don\'t—Maria~, let\'s keep that a secret, okay?"
"Faaall?
 What the hell\'s that?"
"Heheh!
 Sorry, but you won\'t be seeing that weakness of mine now!
 After all, the nightmare plane trip is already over and done with!
 Only thing left is the nice, quiet splashing of the boat trip.
 I never thought I\'d become so fond of that piece‐a‐junk boat.
 Ihihihi!"
"Huh???
 George nii‐san, is there something wrong with his head?"
"You\'ll understand soon.
 Very soon."
At the time, I didn\'t understand what Aniki meant by that big smile...
"What have we here......oooh!
 Battler‐san, how big you\'ve grown...!"
Who\'s it this time?
 It\'s an old lady with an apron.
{n}.........Oh, oh yeah, that takes me back...I remember now!
"Remember her, Battler‐kun?
 You remember—she\'s Kumasawa‐san, one of the servants."
"I could never forget Kumasawa baa‐chan!
 I mean, you haven\'t aged a bit in these past six years.
 Wait, you haven\'t gotten younger, have you~?"
"Hoh‐hoh‐ho!
 Lately, my skin has been getting all smooth and silky!
 And look, hasn\'t my chest gotten even bigger as well?
 ...Want to give it a rub?"
"V‐very funny!
 My breast rubbing is strictly limited to bouncy girls!"
"Even I had some bouncy ones in my youth, you know~?
 Now, now, please feel free to have a go!"
"Gyah, gimme a break!
 It\'s chicks I\'m looking for, dammit!
 Not grannies!"
The jokes I\'d cracked about Jessica were being used against me.
 Come to think of it, she always was the type to tease people!
"Kumasawa‐san, stop that now.
 People with one foot in the coffin shouldn\'t jump around."
"To sport with the young is the best rejuvenation medicine.
 Hoh‐hoh‐ho!"
"It\'s rare for you to come pick us up, Kumasawa‐san.
 What curious turn of events is this?
 Normally whenever you\'re entrusted with something to do, your lumbago always kicks in.
 *snicker*."
"Hoh‐hoh‐ho, Eva‐sama, you are harsh as usual.
 I found myself with some urgent purchases to make, and while I was at it, I thought I would come welcome you all.
 Although, it does give a bad impression if the one waiting to greet you is a decrepit old woman.
 Hoh‐hoh‐ho...!"
Auntie Eva spoke sarcastically, but Kumasawa baa‐chan\'s years of experience were nothing to sneeze at.
 She was more than capable of smoothly and coolly letting that comment slide.
Well, I\'d rather not say it, but old Kumasawa baa‐chan may be past her prime as a servant.
She might act as though she\'s in good health, but between her headaches and the lumbago, her body is wearing out.
 To tell the truth, the very fact that she\'s still working is impressive.
...How old is she this year again?
{n}She must be pushing eighty by now.
{n}It\'s incredible that she\'s still able to act so brightly.
"You just seem to get more and more lively.
 Oh, that\'s right, here you are.
 It\'s the tea I was talking about before.
 Look, I bought some.
 Please do try it later on."
Auntie Rosa showed her the souvenir bag she\'d taken out of her suitcase.
To think that she had remembered the promise that she had apparently made last year and faithfully bought it.
 ...This sort of thoughtfulness was just like Auntie Rosa.
She wasn\'t the kind of person who would forget or break a promise.
As for Kumasama baa‐chan, she seemed deeply touched by the fact that not only had Auntie Rosa remembered that year‐old promise, she had brought that gift for a simple servant like her.
This woman is Kumasawa Chiyo‐san ({p:0:熊沢 チヨ}).
She\'s a senior servant who\'s been working for the Ushiromiya head house for many years.
{n}As you could expect from someone her age, she isn\'t that good at manual labor, but from kitchen work to cleaning and laundry, she\'s a kind of super servant who can handle just about anything.
It seems like her only flaw is a tendency to slack off.
I hear she tries to get away from heavy or troublesome work by playing up her chronic diseases.
......In Kumasawa baa‐chan\'s case, maybe we should call that a sort of lazy craftiness.
...Though it probably doesn\'t impress those paying her salary.
Ah well, even if she\'s pretty flaky when it comes to work, I could never dislike her.
I guess that\'s probably because of her cheerfulness and her constant smile.
"Hey, glad to see you\'re still in fine spirits!
 How\'s your back doin\' then?"
"Even with the medicine, it\'s not getting one whit better.
 According to the doctor, nothing can be done for this one.
 It\'s what\'s called an incurable disease, hoh‐hoh‐ho!"
"Blows me away how you\'ve just kept getting prettier, Jessica‐chan.
 Be glad you ended up like Natsuhi nee‐san."
"R‐really...?
 Personally, I don\'t think I look like her at all...
 I mean, I don\'t even want to be like my parents.
 \'Cause I got zero respect for \'em."
"Now, you shouldn\'t say such things.
 *giggle*, it\'s amazing how many people don\'t want to be like their parents in our family."
"Ah, that\'s me!"
"Hell no, don\'t you dare start taking after me.
 Your nose looking like mine already pisses me off."
"What are you talking about?
 It\'s ridiculous how completely alike you are—and like your father."
"Come on, you can\'t be serious...
 Just how am I like Dad?"
"You\'re his copy in arrogance and self‐importance.
 Father\'s blood is especially strong in you and Nii‐san.
 Wouldn\'t you say, Rosa?"
"Oh, absolutely.
 Krauss nii‐san and Rudolf nii‐san are almost unbelievably like Dad."
"Alright, alright already, why am I the only one under fire from the girls?
 Hideyoshi nii‐san, please help me out."
"My my, Rudolf‐kun, you\'re always so popular with the ladies.
 I\'m jealous!
 Wahahahaha!"
"Hoh‐hoh‐ho!
 As usual, you\'re popular enough to make me jealous.
 Well then, everyone, shall we head over to the boat?
 Come now, Maria‐san, let\'s get on the boat together, alright?"
"Get on the boat together.
 Uu!
 Everyone gets on together.
 Uu!"
"Hell yeah, this time around I\'m not gonna be scared.
 I\'m used to being shaken by the waves.
 With that piece‐a‐junk fishing boat, I\'m less afraid of the shaking than the engine breaking down and the boat drifting off."
"Oh yes, Battler‐kun, I forgot to tell you.
 ...That fishing boat was completely decrepit, so it was taken out of use a few years back.
 Now we get taken to the island in another boat."
"Ohhh, right.
 It\'s Battler\'s first time in the new boat!
 It\'s super comfy!
 And frickin\' fast!
 It can go at crazy high speeds!"
"Ohhh...
 That means less trip time, right?
 That sounds great!
 I mean, a boat might be better than an airplane, but if you\'re telling me we can spend even a little less time exposed to the danger of sinking, that\'s really just awesomely great~."
"...Uu.
 Is Battler gonna faaall gonna faaall again?"
"That\'s only on airplanes.
 Everything\'s fine now!"
"You know, it\'s apparently a modded high‐speed boat, the captain\'s pride and joy!
 Seems he\'s tinkered with it quite a lot—
he was going on about how he attached four high efficiency propellers to it, and now it can break 40 knots, or something like that.
 He bragged to me so much I ended up memorizing it."
"Me too; I remember since we\'re told about it every year.
 The captain said that since he lost a speed contest with a foreign fishing boat a long time ago, he became obsessed with modding.
 He told us how his opponent back then could go at over 30 knots, even though it was only in a fishing boat."
"To fulfill his thirst for a revenge match, he created an awesome whole new super high‐speed modded boat.
 I\'m sure you\'ll just love it, Battler."
...S‐super high‐speed modded boat...?
......My first thought was that this would be much better than some beat‐up boat that might sink at any time......
but for some reason, I\'m getting this feeling of foreboding...
 ......Nah.
"Hey, Battler, maybe you should just swim to the island."
"Battler‐kun, you shouldn\'t lean over the railing too much.
 You might fall."
"Uu‐uu!!
 Gonna faaall gonna faaall!!"
"Daaaaammiiiiit...so this is why you were all grinning before!"
The super high‐speed boat, said to have been modded to hell and back by its captain as a personal hobby, was definitely nothing like the battered old fishing boat from six years ago.
"Whooooooooa, it\'s shaking it\'s shaking it\'s shaking!!
 I\'m gonna fall gonna fall gonna fall!!"
"Uu‐uu‐uu!!
 Gonna fall gonna fall gonna fall!!"
"If I fall I\'ll be in the sea, I\'ll drown goddammit—where\'s the parachute—no, wait—where\'s the buoy?!
 Gimme a life jackeeeet!!"
"Waah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐ha!
 What the hell, Battler, what\'s that supposed to be...waah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐ha!"
"Jessica‐chan, Maria‐chan, it\'s not nice to tease.
 Battler‐kun, if you\'re scared, then just don\'t come out on the deck.
 I think that if you stay inside the boat, you\'ll be a bit less afraid."
"Heheh, that\'s a no‐thank‐you, Aniki!
 Shipwreck victims are always the ones inside the boat.
 The survivors are usually those on the deck during the accident.
 So I\'m staying right here!!"
"But, it\'s shakiiiiing!!
 I\'m falliiing!!
 Whooooaaaaaahhh!!"
"Shaking falliing!!
 Uu‐uu‐uu!!"
"Maria, I told you to behave yourself!
 ......But Battler‐kun, it looks like you really can\'t handle it...
 I\'ll go tell the captain to slow down for you."
"Whooooa, Auntie Rosa, thank yooooouuuuu!
 Even on the sea, exercise safe driving, reduce speeds, point and caaaall!!"
"*cackle*!
 Don\'t do that, Rosa.
 Ordeals are necessary for the young.
 Right, Battler‐kun?
 You can conquer this much, no problem at all, right?
 Otherwise, you won\'t be able to go to Egypt with your aunt!"
"Whooooa, Auntie Eva, you\'re meeeeeeeeaaaan!
 Ooh noooo, I\'m gonna faaaaaall!!
 Life jackeeeet, parachuuuute!!
 Whoooooooaaaaaaahh......!!!"
"N‐no, okay, turn it over and think that way!!
 What\'s the enemy aiming for?!
 He wants to make me afraid like this?!
 If that\'s what he\'s aiming for, too bad, like hell I\'ll be scaaaaaaaared!!
 But stooopp iiit, I\'m gonna faaaaaaall!!!"
...So, after I made a huge fool of myself for a while,
 Auntie Rosa had a talk with the boat captain, and he slowed down to a more manageable speed for me...
"............Hahh...
 This speed is a bit better...
 .........Earlier, I didn\'t even feel alive......"
The new speed, which I was capable of tolerating, was apparently extremely slow.
...But that just now was completely insane...
The whole boat was shaking!
{n}Sliding and leaping on the ocean\'s surface!
{n}It felt like I was riding on the back of a flying fish...
Jessica was still guffawing at me as I leaned against the railing, tired and disheartened.
"I lost in that strength contest earlier, but I\'m glad to know I\'ve got the edge where it really counts.
 But seriously, pfffahahahahah!"
"Dammit...go ahead and laugh.
 One of these days, I\'m gonna find your weakness and I\'ll get back at you...and then your boobs will be mine to squish......"
"Ahahaha, well, we\'ll see about that if you ever do find it, okay?!
 Waah‐hah‐hah‐ha!"
"Uu.
 Battler, all worn out."
"Yeah, Battler, all worn out...
 I want to die on land, not in the ocean or the sky..."
Maria was patting my back, so I patted her head in return.
...Her expression was blank, as usual, but I realized that she wanted to console me.
"Battler‐kun, the captain is throwing in drinks to make up for this.
 Have a drink and take a break, why don\'t you?
 To calm yourself down."
George‐aniki and Kumasawa baa‐chan brought us each an ice‐cold drink with drops of moisture on the can.
Judging from Kumasawa‐san\'s big grin, our parents inside the boat were probably all rolling around laughing at my moment of pure terror.
Dammit, I\'m so embarrassed that I can\'t bear to face any of them...
If I didn\'t change the subject somehow, I had the feeling I\'d be the butt of everyone\'s jokes for the whole trip, so I tried to think of something harmless to talk about.
"...Hey, Jessica.
 How are Uncle Krauss and Aunt Natsuhi doing?"
"My old man and my mom?
 Unfortunately, they\'re fine.
 Though every other word out of their mouths is "study, study", which pisses me off.
 I\'m so jealous, \'cause it doesn\'t look like Uncle Hideyoshi or Uncle Rudolf say those kinds of things."
"Hahaha, oh no.
 When I was slacking off during exams, I was always getting told "exams, exams".
 I thought it was annoying, but now I\'m grateful."
"Hah, I knew it, George‐aniki is magnanimous as ever...
 As for me, I have to look after myself.
 No one says a thing to me!
 Well, it\'s not like I\'d listen if they did, hihihi!"
"Battler‐san, have you still not returned to your birth home?"
"...Well, I kinda go back now and then.
 I still have lots of clothes and stuff left at the previous house."
"......Uu?
 Battler has two homes?"
"Uh,
 .........hmmm.
 ......Something like that."
"Why?
 Why do you have two homes?
 Uu?
 Uu?"
Only Maria, who couldn\'t really grasp the situation, voiced her naive question.
However, the others just shot nervous glances at me, choosing not to respond even though they knew the answer.
"Maria!
 Look, you can see the harbor now...!
 Look, over there!
 Can you see it?!"
"Uu!
 Saw the harbor, saw the harbor!"
Apparently, Jessica was trying to be nice by changing the subject.
......Ah, well.
 I\'d rather not talk about it if I can help it, but it\'s uncomfortable to have it treated like some kind of weird taboo.
......I don\'t mind that much myself anymore.
I am an Ushiromiya,
 but the truth is that, for the past six years, I\'ve been living with my grandparents on my late mother\'s side, and I\'ve even been using her family name.
When those grandparents passed away one after the other, I\'d basically had no choice except to go back and live with the old bastard.
Don\'t get me wrong. I didn\'t just run away from home or anything like that.
{n}The only one at fault here is my dad.
......I don\'t really blame Kyrie‐san.
{n}Being able to hold that old bastard\'s reins and ride him out is no mean feat.
...But as for the betrayal that the old bastard inflicted on my mom...
 ......Well, unfortunately, I still haven\'t fully gotten over that.
"*ahem*.
 We\'ll be getting there soon."
George‐aniki cleared his throat, trying to change the topic.
"......Please forgive my indiscretion.
 It seems this old woman has said too much already.
 If I have hurt your feelings—"
"Heheh!
 I don\'t mind it and no one\'s feelings are hurt.
 Don\'t worry, Kumasawa baa‐chan."
Kumasawa‐san seemed to regret speaking out of turn,
 but I was more concerned about being worried over for something like that, so I stood up and passed it off lightly.
After that, I had a sip of my drink and headed over to Maria and Jessica, who were gazing at the silhouette of the island.
"Uu!
 Battler, saw the island, saw the island!
 There there there!
 Uu‐uu‐uu!"
"Where is it...oh, I see it now.
 Even after six years, the island hasn\'t changed a bit."
The small island\'s silhouette in front of us had gotten pretty close.
This island\'s name is Rokkenjima.
{n}It\'s a small island about ten kilometers around, located in the Izu Archipelago.
Since they call this archipelago "the Izu Seven", lots of people think there are seven islands, but that\'s not true.
There are actually more than seven.
{n}Rokkenjima is one of the minor islands that don\'t get counted.
Even considering that, there are probably very few people who know about this island.
After all, only the people of the Ushiromiya family come to this island.
In other words, it has no ties whatsoever to outsiders or tourists.
{n}So, you\'ll never find this island\'s name in a travel brochure.
This is because all of Rokkenjima is an estate possessed by the Ushiromiya head house.
Only the Ushiromiya family lives there, and only people connected to the Ushiromiya family come and go there.
There\'s nothing there except a harbor and a mansion.
{n}The vast majority of the island is still just uncultivated forest.
Such a waste, when it could be made into a nice golf course.
{n}However, when you realize that the entire coastline is a private beach, it starts to sound pretty magnificent.
You might have realized it by now, but to put it simply,
 ......well, the Ushiromiya family is just rolling in dough.
The fortune possessed by the head house is apparently vast,
 and Dad and the others who make up the branch families have built up plenty of wealth for themselves, finding success in their respective businesses.
I\'ve been living a commoner\'s life at my grandparents\' home these six years, so I\'d completely forgotten,
 ...but the old bastard\'s house really is elegant, and everything about it is tuned to match the snobbish tastes of the annoyingly rich.
Come to think of it, I guess that means George‐aniki, Jessica, Maria, and I are all wealthy, high‐class gentlemen and ladies.
Needless to say, none of us feel that way at all.
I don\'t see myself as being rich, and George‐aniki, who takes self‐discipline very seriously, doesn\'t let himself get too comfortable.
Jessica is always complaining that she\'d rather move to the city than be rich,
 and Maria is still a kid who isn\'t even interested in money at all.
...I guess that attitude itself is snobbish.
{n}From the perspective of people in poverty who can\'t pay the bills, we\'re very lucky to even have the luxury of thinking this way.
This isn\'t the place to explain any further, so I won\'t.
Anyway, it\'s the same as not being able to choose the parents you\'re born from.
{n}I didn\'t ask to be born into a rich family.
{n}And I don\'t think it\'s something I should be hated for.
It can be pretty trying when people are prejudiced against you just because you\'re rich and refuse to judge you by your merits...
As I pondered these sentimental thoughts, Maria leaned over the railing and started shouting.
"............Uu.
 ......Gone."
"What\'s wrong, Maria?
 Did you drop something?"
"Uu‐uu!
 Gone, gone!
 Uu‐uu‐uu‐uu!!"
Maria kept yelling "gone, gone".
From her words alone, you would think she had perhaps dropped something, but she was actually pointing out over the ocean as she shouted.
"What\'s wrong?
 What\'s gone?
 I\'ll look for it too, if you want.
 What is it?
 ...............?"
If she\'d dropped something, she would probably have looked down at the floor, but Maria was pointing out over the ocean.
One would assume that she had seen something out over the ocean, but she kept saying that something was {i:gone}.
 .........Strange.
However, since my last memories of this place came from six years ago, I was able to spot it before Aniki, who comes here every year.
"............Huh...?
 ......If I remember correctly, wasn\'t there a {c:86EF9C:torii} or something on top of a small crag around here?
 ...That\'s right, it was definitely there.
 I remember it well, since it\'s like a landmark, the first thing to greet you as you get closer to the island."
"Wow, you\'re amazing, Battler.
 Even though it\'s been six years, you remembered."
"It was here, wasn\'t it...!
 I remember too.
 There used to be a shrine and a torii‐like thing standing all alone on that crag.
 ......And now that you mention it, they are gone, aren\'t they.
 They definitely were there last year, I think."
"Gone.
 Gone.
 Uu‐uu‐uu!"
"Maybe they were washed away by the waves or something?
 It was a small crag, it probably got brittle because of its exposure."
"I think so too.
 It actually disappeared during the summer.
 Apparently—"
"A huge lightning bolt fell one evening and smashed the shrine, or some such...
 ......The fishermen whisper that it must undoubtedly be an ominous sign, to have a thunderbolt fall upon our tutelary god.
 ...Lightning begone, lightning begone..."
Kumasawa‐san smiled impishly as if teasing us, rubbing her hands together.
However, Maria was apparently taking it seriously,
 and she stared fixedly over the ocean to where the crag enshrining the local guardian deity was supposed to be.
"............An ominous...sign.
 ............Uu."
"Enough, Kumasawa‐san.
 Maria isn\'t old enough to understand this kind of joke."
"It\'s alright, Maria‐chan.
 It\'s just a coincidence.
 Nothing scary\'s gonna happen."
George‐aniki put a hand on Maria\'s shoulder to calm her down, but Maria\'s sharp‐eyed expression didn\'t budge.
"............Ominous.
 ............Ominous."
Maria muttered that word over and over.
{n}Apparently, repeating a single word over and over is a habit that Maria\'s had for a long time.
However, since the word she was saying was quite literally ominous, it was a bit creepy.
"Hey now, Maria.
 Some disaster really will come if you say that word over and over, you know?"
I tapped Maria\'s other shoulder.
And then, Maria whipped her head around, stared into my face, and spoke unblinkingly.
"Uu.
 .........Disaster...coming."
"Huh?
 And just where is it coming from?"
I answered light‐heartedly, trying to break the tension in the air.
...And in reply, Maria held up a finger, raised her arm high, ...and pointed up to the heavens.
When I looked up, I saw that the sky was still just as cloudy, but it had grown a great deal more leaden than it had been that morning.
That\'s right—they were saying that a typhoon was approaching.
...We had planned to spend one night on the island, but if this storm doesn\'t pass quickly, I won\'t be able to make it to school on Monday.
{n}Well, I guess it makes for a pretty good excuse to be absent.
".....................Uu..."
...She apparently sensed something ominous in this cloudy sky.
{n}She\'s been muttering for a while now.
Girls at Maria\'s age tend to be very impressionable.
{n}She\'s just about the age when many girls start to get excited about sixth senses and whether they have any psychic potential and stuff.
...In a way, being sensitive about things like this isn\'t really out of the ordinary for a kid like her.
"It\'s alright, Maria‐chan.
 The weather might get worse around tonight, but tomorrow it\'ll clear up and become a pretty blue sky."
"Uu.
 Pretty blue sky.........
 .........Uu..."
"That\'s right, by tomorrow it\'ll be a pretty blue sky.
 There\'s no rain that doesn\'t end, and no clouds that never clear."
"Uu...
 .........Rain that doesn\'t end.
 ...Clouds that never clear.
 ..................Uu........."
"Sure, the typhoon\'s coming, but it\'ll be gone before you know it!
 It\'s alright, Maria."
"...............Uu.
 ...Uu!!
 Uu‐uu‐uu!!
 Uu‐uu‐uu!!"
Maria started yelling "uu‐uu".
{n}...It looked as though she was having a tantrum because no one could understand what she was trying to say.
What in the world is Maria trying so desperately to warn us about?
Unable to understand her, we could do nothing but feel a vague sense of foreboding...
......I\'ve heard that everyone can feel the supernatural, but that it weakens as you age.
That might mean that Maria, the youngest one of us all, still possessed some kind of sense that the rest of us had lost.
...I wonder if that sense is sending her a warning.
At that moment, Kumasawa‐san quietly opened her mouth.
".........Rumor has it...
that long ago, Rokkenjima was—"
"Kumasawa‐san.
 Let\'s not talk about that now."
Just as Kumasawa‐san was about to tell some kind of story, Jessica sharply interrupted her.
For Jessica, this was an extremely firm reaction.
I wanted to push her further, just out of simple curiosity,
 but judging by how Jessica was acting, it wasn\'t difficult to imagine that it would simply inflame Maria\'s unease further.
...If I did try to press her for the story, the odds were pretty good that it wouldn\'t be anything bright and cheery.
"......Hoh‐hoh‐ho, I do apologize about that...
 ...The wind here is hard to bear for the elderly, so if you would excuse me for now..."
Gossipers have no reason to hang around after they\'ve been told to stop chatting.
When Kumasawa‐san finally realized that she\'d overstepped her bounds, she went back inside the boat.
After she left, Uncle Hideyoshi came along to replace her.
Since he\'d shown up partway through, he completely failed to notice the complicated atmosphere that hung about the scene,
 so he refreshingly and unwittingly swept that atmosphere aside.
So, in the end, it was his unwittingness that brightened the mood.
"Looks like we\'re almost there!
 Alright, just a little more!
 Took forever at the speed we went today, didn\'t it?
 You all know whose fault that is!
 Wahhahahahaha!"
"Aww, Uncle Hideyoshi, gimme a break already~...hahaha~!"
"Ahaha, keep on twisting the knife.
 Seriously, \'cause of Battler, it\'s takin\' fore~ver!"
".........Uu."
Maria had probably come to the conclusion that no one was going to listen to her.
She hung her head, wearing a fretful face.
As she did, George‐aniki crouched down to meet her eyes and spoke to her kindly.
"Maria‐chan.
 There\'s nothing to be afraid of.
 Because we\'re all together.
 There\'s nothing to be afraid of if we\'re together.
 Go ahead and say it."
"............Uu.
 ...There\'s nothing to be afraid of...if we\'re together..."
"Yes.
 There\'s nothing to be afraid of if we\'re together."
"............Uu."
"Yeah, George‐aniki knows what he\'s talking about.
 If we\'re all together, there\'ll absolutely never be anything at all to be scared of.
 Right, Jessica?"
"Yeah, no doubt about that.
 George nii‐san always tells the truth, Maria."
"......Uu.
 George onii‐chan always true."
"Yes.
 I don\'t lie.
 So trust me.
 There\'s nothing to be afraid of if we\'re all together."
"Uu.
 ......George onii‐chan doesn\'t lie.
 I trust you.
 There\'s nothing to be afraid of if we\'re all together.
 .........Uu, not afraid!"
Maria jumped into George‐aniki\'s arms and hugged him tightly.
After Aniki patted her head, she jumped away again.
Her facial expression had returned so completely to normal that she looked like a totally different person from moments before.
{n}She was once again the ordinary Maria.
"Uu.
 There\'s nothing to be afraid of anymore, because we\'re all together.
 ...Uu‐uu."
"Yeah, that\'s it.
 ...You look all better now.
 You\'re strong, Maria, good girl!"
"......Uu!
 {c:86EF9C:I\'m} a good girl!"
"Hey now, what\'s goin\' on here?
 Maria‐chan didn\'t get seasick, did she?
 Hm?"
"Hahaha, well, something like that.
 We\'ll be arriving soon."
The harbor was already drawing near.
