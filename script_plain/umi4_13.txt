......It was......a pitch‐black room.
There were no windows, and by the light from the weak bulb, one could only just barely make out the state of things around them.
It appeared to be an old, forgotten, dusty underground storehouse, with some kind of furniture haphazardly thrown into it......
However, even with just a little light, one could at least tell that it probably wasn\'t a storehouse.
......Because that room was sealed off with iron bars.
"......Where...is this.........?"
"Not a clue...
 ......Is this place underneath the mansion......?
 Was there this kind of room......directly underneath the dining hall......?"
They had been dropped into what had appeared to be a pit, and {i:fallen} into this room.
Therefore, it would be appropriate to think that this room was directly below the dining hall.
......However, not even Krauss could bring himself to believe that there were pitfalls rigged in the beloved dining hall, where he had enjoyed his meals for years,
 ...and that directly below it was this dungeon‐like room.
But the ceiling, when they looked up, was made of rugged stone, ......and they could not understand from where in that ceiling they could have fallen.
No, all five people who had been dropped here thought the same thing.
Although they had felt a sensation of being dropped into a pit,
 ......there was no way there could be pitfalls in the dining hall, nor could this dungeon‐like place be directly underneath it.
......But, in point of fact, they {i:had} fallen into this place, and were locked in.
{n}......And so, ...they were confused.
"......It is lucky that no one was hurt after falling from such a height..."
".........Shannon, Kanon.
 Did either of you two know about this room...?"
"......No.
 We also have no knowledge of any room like this."
"..................Really...?"
"R‐really......
 We really......don\'t know any room like this......"
It seemed that Kyrie thought that there was a good chance that, despite their age,
 they might know of the mansion\'s secret tricks as servants permitted the One‐winged Eagle.
There was a long silence, as if evaluating their answer...
"......No, it\'s probably true that they don\'t know.
 Shannon is a very tidy person, after all."
"If she had known about this room, it would probably have been scrubbed until it was sparkling.
 The filth of this room is proof that you two don\'t know of it.
 ......More importantly than that, I think we should worry about what to do now, don\'t you?"
"E‐exactly......
 We need to call the police...o‐or rather, call for medical assistance as soon as possible......"
Nanjo\'s words rang hollow.
...Obviously.
Six people had been killed in the dining hall.
{n}They had all witnessed the exact moments when the six had been killed.
And what\'s more, it had been done by half‐destroying their heads—
anyone could tell with just a single glance that they had been dealt a fatal injury.
Everyone understood that calling for an ambulance now would be completely meaningless......
"Thank you, Doctor Nanjo.
 ......We already understand that our partners are no longer alive.
 .........Thanks for trying to console us by mentioning medical assistance."
".........Natsuhi......
 .............................."
Once again, an oppressive silence took control of them.
But Krauss shook his head harshly over and over, and decided just for now to forget the pain of losing his wife,
 and dedicate himself to figuring out where they were.
"Everyone, listen to me.
 ...............Dad is...
.........beyond hope now.
 ...The time for words, and seeking comprehension or an explanation...
is long past."
Nobody answered.
......Without any kind of discussion or mercy, six people had been killed in an instant.
And Kinzo had so boldly proclaimed for them to become sacrifices in a thirteen‐person murder ritual.
......Since they had been locked up in this place,
 they too would probably become the ritual\'s next sacrifices before long.
Around this time, their eyes were becoming used to the darkness,
 and, bit by bit, they were starting to be able to make out the dungeon\'s interior.
......What they thought was furniture haphazardly left in the dungeon turned out not to be furniture at all.
They were......small cages that could be used to imprison a single person, restraining tables, ......or were those torture racks?
.....At any rate, it was obviously more ghastly than a mere jail cell.
Since those objects were rusted and covered in thick layers of dust, there was no doubt that they had been long‐forgotten.
......Maybe you could even have called those things Kinzo\'s sealed and forgotten madness.
However, it was this room in which they had now been locked away.
.........Those objects weren\'t exactly comforting to people who were locked up,
 hoping to be released without harm...
"......Anyway, let\'s get out of here.
 We\'ve lost loved ones and friends and would like to spend some time shedding tears,
 but more than that, ......I\'m worried about the children."
".........I, ...I wonder if the children are safe......"
"All we can do is pray...
 ......Come to think of it, Kumasawa‐san and Gohda‐san aren\'t here."
"Perhaps they were able to...get away safely..."
"You never know.
 It\'d be a relief if they were able to meet up with the children..."
"Gohda‐san can be relied upon in times of crisis, and Kumasawa‐san is knowledgeable and calm...
 I\'m sure they would be helpful to the children..."
"......Hahaha.
 I hope so."
Shannon and Krauss smiled bitterly a little.
 But they quickly realized how improper that was, and stopped, clearing their throats.
".........We can\'t be too optimistic, Nee‐san.
 There\'s a chance that they have already been attacked, after we were."
"I agree.
 What Father carried out in the dining hall was...
...the six murders of the first twilight from the witch\'s epitaph, right?
 Then, the second twilight is to "tear apart the two who are close"."
"......We can\'t deny the possibility that Gohda‐san and Kumasawa‐san may have already been killed, having run away to hide together in close company.
 .........We can\'t cling to the optimistic idea that they definitely got to the guesthouse and are protecting the children."
Kyrie coldly analyzed the worst‐case scenario.
Even for her, it was heartbreaking to have lost her beloved husband.
{n}......But right now, the most important thing was protecting that husband\'s son,
 along with the other children, from becoming sacrifices to the insane family head.
She overcame her sadness with the parental urge to protect the children.
......It seemed that both Kyrie and Krauss were strong enough to forget their grief, if only for the time being...
They could let their tears flow later.
......For now, in order to protect the children, they had to act.
"Anyway, let\'s get out of here...
 It seems to be a rather old cell.
 Couldn\'t we break the bars somehow?
 Let\'s try searching the entire room for some way to escape."
"There\'s all kinds of junk around here. I wonder if there are any tools lying around that we could use.
 There might be something that we could use as a weapon, or something that we could use to break the bars."
Kyrie pulled a lighter from her pocket.
She herself didn\'t smoke, but she kept one tucked away in her pocket to light Rudolf\'s cigarettes.
......It was an extremely valuable source of light for searching through this dim dungeon.
"Shannon, help Kyrie‐san search the room.
 Kanon, you\'ll help me check out the bars.
 This is a very old cell.
 The bars could be loose."
"Wh‐what should I help with......?"
"Please just keep up your strength.
 ......Father will probably come here before long.
 You\'re the only one whose words will reach him.
 In a way, you might be holding our lives in your hands."
"......My words...will no longer reach him, I think.
 I\'m sorry, but I don\'t believe I will be of any use......"
"Then lend us your expertise as a doctor.
 .........I wonder if there is a drug that makes people instantly faint?"
"......A drug that makes people instantly faint......?
 What are you talking about......?"
"We believe we fell through a pit, and landed in this dungeon.
 ......In that panic‐stricken place, that\'s what we believed happened."
"......But looking at how large this room is, I came to a realization.
 This dungeon cannot be underneath the dining hall."
"How can you tell that it can\'t...?"
"............You\'re an idiot, Nee‐san.
 This dungeon is too narrow compared to the dining hall."
"Exactly.
 The first person to fall was Krauss nii‐san.
 The second was myself.
 When you fell into this room, did you move from that spot, Krauss nii‐san?"
"......It\'s embarrassing to say, but I lay there groaning in pain from the landing.
 Immediately after that, you came crashing down next to me."
"The distance between us as we stood in the dining hall, compared to where we landed, is clearly strange."
"C‐...certainly, when you put it that way.
 ......I was the next to fall, so I remember fairly well where you two were standing.
 ......The distance between you two in the dining hall might have been greater than this entire room."
"We fell into a pit, and directly dropped down here.
 ......It\'s not like we fell into multiple intersecting pipes, and were all collected together before falling down here."
"The fall was instant, wasn\'t it?
 I don\'t remember rolling around in some sort of elaborate water pipe system."
"............Indeed, we can\'t explain that with a pitfall.
 ...How strange."
"What does that have to do with......the drug that makes people instantly faint that Kyrie‐sama was talking about...?"
"...........................
 ......Kyrie‐sama is probably thinking that there were no pitfalls in the dining hall, I would guess."
"But we did actually fall."
"To put it accurately, we had the feeling that we fell into a pit.
 ......It\'s only natural.
 That\'s the only way we could describe such an experience."
"I, I see......
 In other words, this is what you\'re getting at..."
"......We were not dropped into a pit,
 ......but shot, for example, with something like a blowdart, lost consciousness instantly, and the instant we fell to the floor,
 it could be that we just remember that as though we fell into a pit......"
"............I see.
 That\'s a much more persuasive explanation than there being numerous pitfall traps in the dining hall that we\'ve never noticed, even after decades eating there."
"......Nee‐san.
 Do you have a watch?"
"Huh?
 .........Y‐...yes.
 I have a pocket watch.
 .........Umm, it\'s about twenty to eleven."
".........Yes.
 My watch says the same.
 ...In short, it hasn\'t been more than ten minutes since that chaos in the dining hall."
"My watch likewise.
 ............That\'s much too short a time to knock us out and carry us somewhere.
 .........Judging only from the time, it\'s reasonable to think that we did fall through a hole leading directly underneath the dining hall."
"Watch hands are easily tampered with.
 ......While we were passed out, they may have wound everyone\'s watch back.
 We are incapable of proving that this possibility doesn\'t exist."
"...........................
 Whether a pitfall, or else a drug that induces fainting,
 ......it does not change the fact that we need to be on our guard..."
"......So, Doctor Nanjo?
 Is there a drug that can do that?"
"Well, ............
 ......It\'s the same as your logic, Kyrie‐san.
 ...I cannot prove that there is not a drug with that effect of which I do not know."
"......As they say, you can never be too careful.
 ...Sorry, it was a pointless question.
 Except, I think that with my hypothesis, I was able to suggest that this dungeon is not necessarily directly underneath the dining hall."
"I see...
 .......There\'s always the possibility that we were carried off to a dungeon in Father\'s hidden mansion,
 which is rumored to be hidden somewhere in the middle of the vast forest.
 ......If we can escape from here and get outside, then we\'ll know.
 We can save worrying about that until after we get out."
"Exactly.
 I\'m truly sorry.
 I\'ve only been asking and inquiring into useless things."
"No, it\'s quite reassuring.
 Please continue to tell us if you notice anything else.
 It might become a hint to escaping from here."
".........I always heard from Rudolf.
 He was always surprised by your ideas, and they would sometimes serve as valuable hints.
 ......The fact that you\'re here is a blessing within a tragedy."
"......Thank you.
 Rudolf‐san told me something about you, as well.
 He said that you usually act big, but when things get serious, you overflow with a sense of responsibility, and are a very dependable older brother."
"Hahaha... That\'s too kind.
 .........Dammit, these iron bars won\'t even budge.
 How are things on your end, Kanon?"
".........No luck here either, I\'m afraid."
Krauss and Kanon tried wiggling each of the bars in various ways.
......There were a few bars that could be twisted,
 and a few felt like they had enough room to rattle around a little bit,
 but even so, they could not be broken with human strength alone.
......However, there was still hope if they could use some kind of lever‐like tool.
It was still far too early to give up yet.
The children\'s lives were hanging in the balance.
 ......Even if there was no hope, they couldn\'t stop their struggle.
And it was better even for them to act this way.
......If they were to stop...there was no doubt that they would once again be overcome by the grief of losing their loved ones, and crouch down, clutching their knees......
"How are you doing, Kyrie‐san?
 Found anything?"
"......I\'ve found some stones small enough to hide in a clenched fist.
 Even this might work as a weapon.
 Though, I\'m sure it\'d be impossible to whittle down those iron bars.
 How about you, Shannon‐chan...?"
"No, nothing."
".........Ah, this is...
............a phone."
"There\'s no way it\'s connected.
 ......But, we might be able to use the cord for tying something up or as some form of weapon.
 If we break it and take it apart, we could take out the metal parts.
 Krauss nii‐san, there is a keyhole for opening the cell, right?"
"Yeah.
 It\'s a pretty large hole, quite old fashioned.
 ......If we twist some wire into it, we just might be able to pick it."
"We might be able to use the metal parts of the phone as a substitute for something.
 ......This phone will become our weapon."
"It\'s the same as investing.
 Information is our weapon."
Krauss and Kyrie laughed together at this way of putting the phone to use, which didn\'t remotely look at it as a means of communication.
"............What are you doing, Nee‐san."
"Ah, ......um, ...I just wondered if maybe...the phone was w‐working......"
"............({i:whisper}) You dummy, Nee‐san."
"Huh...?
 .........What?"
Suddenly, Shannon let out a small surprised cry.
"K‐Kyrie‐sama...!
 .....This phone, it\'s connected."
"What did you say...?"
It was like when people move out of an office, taking everything with them, leaving only the telephone behind—
that\'s the feeling the phone gave off, having been left in the corner of the cell.
The cord was wound into a coil, one end of it being swallowed by the wall,
 and at a glance, it looked as if it could plausibly be connected.
......But, to think that it actually was...
Kyrie took the receiver from Shannon and pressed it to her ear.
{n}The electric hum was certainly the one with which she was familiar.
{n}......This phone was indeed live.
"Wh‐...what good luck...!
 Let\'s contact the police...!"
"Hold on...!
 This is too good to be true.
 Should we not suspect that it\'s bugged...?!"
"If they were planning a trick like that, normally they would cut the telephone line.
 ......There\'s a good possibility that they actually overlooked this."
"If they notice, the line might actually be cut for real.
 There\'s nothing that we could tell the police that would be problematic for us if they overheard."
......That did make sense.
 The point of a wiretap was to overhear some important piece of information,
 but the way things were now, they could not think of a single thing that would come up in a conversation to the outside world that could be troublesome to have heard.
Kyrie instantly concluded that it was more likely to be a mistake on Kinzo\'s part than a trap......
"Y‐...you do have a point......
 I believe that you start with 0 to make calls to the outside......"
"Kanon‐kun, I\'m going to make a phone call, so will you watch how things are out there for me?
 If you sense somebody coming, let me know."
"Y‐yes......!"
Kanon raced off towards the iron bars, silenced his breathing, and strained his ears......
{n}As everyone present watched her, Kyrie dialed {ruby:the police:110}...
However, she pushed the hook down repeatedly and redialed.
......It didn\'t seem to be working very well.
".........The outside line begins with 0?
 110 would be 0110 then, right?
 It doesn\'t seem to want to go through..."
"Hand it over here, I\'ll try to call......
 ..........................."
Krauss took the receiver in Kyrie\'s place, and tested various things......
But in the end, they were unable to notify the police......
The phone itself was definitely live, but the circuit was apparently cut somewhere.
......Did this mean that "they" were not so naive?
"......So it\'s useless after all......"
"So our enemy is no pushover...
 ........................"
Kyrie let out a deep sigh, leaned against the wall, and hung her head for a while.
As tough a girl as she was, for a brief moment, she might actually have had the naive hope that the phone could actually work.
......She sneered at herself mockingly for holding onto that naive hope for even one moment.
And then, ......she thought back upon just what was happening here.
......Honestly...despite having been shown such a thing right before her eyes, ......or rather, exactly because of that...
......she still could not think of that gruesome mass murder as something real...
{n}It was less that she couldn\'t believe it, and more that she didn\'t want to.
Ushiromiya Kinzo had killed six members of his family.
He had summoned strange, witch‐like, demon‐like people,
 ......right out of thin air, ......
.........and with something like magic,
 ......he had begun to kill people one after another..........
...........................
Too much to handle.
 ......Even though she definitely saw it, there was no way she could accept that spectacle......
".........There\'s no way that\'s what happened.
 .........Those were obviously Grandfather\'s friends, or something.
 ......They were just hiding somewhere in the dining hall beforehand, and used some trick to appear suddenly and surprise us.
 .........There\'s no other way to explain something as screwed up as that."
But when those six had had their heads blown apart, a golden arrow had flown around and around the room.
......That had truly looked like...
...magic.
Was that another thing we just saw wrong?
{n}There\'s no way it was magic.
 There must be some kind of trick to it.
......Since it was capable of smashing heads, there\'s no doubt it was some explosive.
For example, a styrene toy plane like they sell at candy stores, painted gold,
 and with a powerful explosive loaded onto the end of it.
.......That said, at a glance, it had seemed to be flying at random;
 Kyrie couldn\'t imagine that such a thing could be fired six times, and each time perfectly hit the victim square in the head, one after the other.
Surely its flight wasn\'t computer‐controlled to seek out and deliver precise hits on its targets,
 which would make it a high‐tech styrene plane on the same level as a guided missile...?
".........Would he invest such a large amount of money into developing some stupid trick like that?
 ......For that insane entertainment......?
 Does this come back to the old "I wouldn\'t put it past Father"......?"
A number of mysterious people had appeared suddenly out of thin air,
 ......six people had had their heads demolished by a mysterious golden flying object,
 ......and the five of us were locked away in a mysterious dungeon by a mysterious set of pitfalls, or else put to sleep by some fainting poison dart......
The family conference started a bit after 10 p.m.
{n}......It\'s only been about thirty minutes since then.
Probably,
 those events, which took place in such a short amount of time,
 ......none of us are able to understand, nor come to grips with, even though we witnessed them ourselves.
Even if we did get ahold of the police,
 it would probably be impossible for any of us to accurately explain what we saw......
I may only just have witnessed it,
 ......but my brain\'s fried, and I have no confidence even in what I myself saw...
Kyrie had to try her hardest to rouse herself from her overwhelming confusion, just to hold onto her sanity......
"Dammit......what\'s going on here,
 ......damn, ...dammit...!"
Krauss started to become desperate, hitting the hook multiple times, and redialing over and over.
......He too was feigning composure, but was unable to hide his panic.
The more he redialed, the more the pretense of serenity peeled away...
None of this makes any sense......
Kyrie couldn\'t help but pray that the events that had just occurred were no more than a dream...
.........Suddenly, the look on Krauss\'s face changed.
"Uh, o......oh...!
 I got through, I got through...!
 It\'s ringing...!"
"R‐really, Krauss‐san...?!"
"Yes, I see it now, the old man was shortsighted...!
 It seems that he cut the external line in an effort to prevent us from contacting the police, but he missed out on severing the internal line...!"
"Internal line?
 Krauss‐san, where did you call...?!"
"The guesthouse.
 I\'m calling the room where Jessica and the rest are staying...!"
"......Ah?!
 Hello!
 Hello?!
 It\'s me...!
 Who is this...?!
 Gohda?!
 Is Jessica there, is she safe...?!!"
"K‐Krauss‐sama......!!
 I\'m so glad you\'re safe...!!
 Yes!
 Milady Jessica and the other children are here as well, safe and unharmed...!"
"Dad!!
 Is that you, Dad?!
 I\'m so glad you\'re okay......!!
 Is Mom okay?!
 Is she there?!"
".........M‐......"
Krauss choked on his words.
......Krauss had clearly seen Natsuhi\'s head crushed, had seen her killed right before his eyes......
Eventually, he was going to have to tell that to Jessica.
......However, Krauss began to fret over whether he should tell her this very moment, and lost his words.
......But even that was an answer under these circumstances......
"......I don\'t know about her......
 ......Let\'s pray she\'s safe.
 ...For now, I\'m just glad you\'re safe."
"...........................Yeah.
 ......I understand.
 .........I\'m sorry for......asking."
Jessica\'s voice was filled with tears...
 ......There was no doubt for Krauss anymore.
{n}Jessica and the others had been told everything, start to finish, by Gohda and Kumasawa when they had met up at the guesthouse...
After they learned that six whole people had been killed,
 Jessica and the others must have been in a frenzy about wanting to go to the dining hall.
.........Luckily he had been able to call before they stormed off towards the mansion.
{n}Krauss was relieved at his good timing during such tragedy...
"We have Kyrie‐san and Doctor Nanjo, as well as Shannon and Kanon here.
 We\'re locked in a place that\'s like a dungeon, but don\'t worry.
 We\'ll figure something out."
"Dungeon?
 Where?!
 We\'ll come save you...!!"
"Unfortunately, we haven\'t the slightest idea where this is either.
 We think it might be under the dining hall, but that might not be true.
 .........But anyway, Jessica.
 You must not leave there.
 You\'ve heard from Gohda what happened?"
"Yeah......
 ......Grandfather,
 .........he...
......{nobr:{m:-5:——}—ed} everyone......"
"Grandfather isn\'t in a sane state of mind right now.
 If you run into him, you\'ll be in danger.
 You might be killed...!
 You mustn\'t even think about trying to come and save us...!
 We\'ll take care of ourselves."
"Th‐then what should we do?!
 Grandfather, you piece of shit, how dare you do that to Mom and the rest......!
 I\'m gonna kill that worthless old bastard...!!"
"Jessica, if you talk like that, you\'ll sadden your mother.
 A lady doesn\'t use those kinds of words."
"Uuuuughhu......uuuuuhughhu......!!"
"Anyway, you all put your own safety first.
 Lock up the guesthouse.
 ......But you mustn\'t get complacent.
 The large window in the downstairs lounge might get broken."
"Stay in the room you\'re in, and use a bed to make a barricade.
 There\'s a toilet and fridge in there too, right?
 You should be able to stay holed up until tomorrow morning."
"......Alright, I\'ll say it again... Don\'t think of anything dangerous.
 And definitely don\'t think about trying to take revenge for Mom!
 Think only of hiding and making it through this, and don\'t provoke the enemy."
"Yeah......mm....!!
 Okay, ......Dad......!
 Uuuuhhughuuuu!!"
After that, Gohda took the phone,
 and was told again to watch over the children as a responsible adult.
......Gohda repeatedly replied "Yes, sir!" in an overstrained voice, his face covered in cold sweat.
From there, Kyrie received the phone and spoke with Battler, and when Shannon and Kanon got their turn, George and Jessica answered.
 And following that, Nanjo and Kumasawa picked up as well, so that all members of both sides had their turn on the phone,
 each encouraging the other and confirming that they were at least safe for now, even if their location was unknown,
 and coming to a complete understanding of the current situation for both sides.
They wanted to talk forever, but now was not the time to chat.
Krauss told them that they would be hanging up for now, and those in the guesthouse agreed.
"If anything else happens, we\'ll call.
 Wait by the phone so you can pick it up quickly.
 Again, be careful.
 You mustn\'t do anything rash...!"
"Y‐......yeah, I understand......
 Just knowing that you and......Kanon‐kun and the rest are safe, ......that\'s a win in my book......
 ...We\'ll do our best.
 Please stay safe...!"
"Yeah, of course.
 Well then, I\'m hanging up for now.
 Be on your guard."
With that, the phone call ended.
Gohda and the rest of the men quickly descended the stairs, closed the shutters, and secured the strong locks on the doors.
However, just as Krauss had worried, there was nothing that could be done about the beautiful wide window in the downstairs lounge.
If this were to be broken, it would be easy for them to get inside.
It wouldn\'t be hard for someone like Kinzo, who hadn\'t hesitated at committing murder, to invade the first floor.
"......It\'s likely that Grandfather and his followers will be armed.
 Locking ourselves in this room is our best bet, and moreover our only method of staying locked down.
 ......It\'s painful that we have no choice but to stuff ourselves in a locked room, but if our enemies are carrying guns, then that\'s the only method we have left to us."
"Th‐the Master is said to have a collection of working guns.
 .........That\'s right, guns, that was a gun...
 If so, ......it\'s a horribly powerful gun...!
 W‐we can\'t contend with that at all...!"
"............Smashing someone\'s head, that takes a hell of a lot of force, right?
 It might be a magnum bullet, or something along those lines.
 That might go through a flimsy door like it\'s nothing."
"If so, then that\'s even more of a reason to barricade ourselves in the room...
 Let\'s put up a bed and block the window too.
 ......If we do that much, then it doesn\'t matter how many guns they\'ve got, they shouldn\'t be able to break in."
"Shit, ......is this passive, one‐sided defense all we can do?
 ...Goddamn him, knocking off my dad, and even capturing Kyrie‐san...
 ......You\'re gonna pay for this, you old goat...!"
"I‐i‐i‐impossible, there\'s no way we can go against them...!!
 Besides, it\'s not just the Master, he has several underlings too!
 Th‐there might even be more of them...!
 .........Just what......are they......?"
Battler was filled to the brim with the urge to get revenge for Rudolf,
 and to rush out of here to save Kyrie.
......But just by looking at how terrified Gohda was, there was no doubt in him that this would be reckless...
"......It\'s gotta be hard on you too, ......right, Aniki?
 And yet we\'ve gotta stay holed up here, ......goddammit......"
"Of course, I\'m torn up about it too.
 ......There\'s no way I could remain calm with both of my parents murdered."
"But specifically because of that, I {i:have} to remain calm!
 Do you think that our murdered parents would want us to die in vain?
 There\'s no way they would!
 They\'d want for at least the children to escape."
"That\'s why I\'m going to survive.
 And I will report this to the police, and uncover everything.
 The courts will avenge my parents.
 {i:That} will be my revenge.
 ......There\'s no way our parents would want us to die taking revenge for them.
 Right...?"
"...........................
 ......You\'re right...
 You\'re damn right...
 ......That old bastard, fuck your stupid ritual...!
 If you\'re saying we\'re gonna be sacrifices for that, then we\'ll run away just to spite you, and fuck up the whole goddamn thing......"
"That\'s the way.
 ......Besides, you still have Kyrie‐san, Battler‐kun.
 And I still have Shannon.
 Let\'s just act cautiously and wait for our chance.
 Carelessness on our part might even work against the others who are captured."
"......Hostages, ......huh.
 .........But Grandfather captured them so he could use them as sacrifices, right?!
 If we don\'t go and save them, then they\'re just waiting to be killed, aren\'t they?!"
"We don\'t even know where the dungeon they\'re being held in is...!
 Neither did Shannon or Kanon‐kun, or of course Gohda‐san or Kumasawa‐san."
"The probability that they\'re in a secret location that only Grandfather knows of is incredibly high.
 ...Under these circumstances, aimlessly wandering about is suicide!"
"......I, ......I know that...
 .........But still......goddammit......are you saying the only thing we can do is stay confined here until something happens......?"
"Ba‐......Battler‐sama, I understand your feelings, but...
......let\'s put safety first...
 ......From what Krauss‐sama said, they seem to be in a fairly old cell,
 and they may be able to break the bars somehow.
 ......The wise choice of action now is to believe in them and wait."
"Grandfather has a number of subordinates, and they\'re all armed, correct...?"
"Y‐......yes, that is correct.
 .........And they\'re probably...
yes, all armed......"
Gohda had been able to say that Kinzo had others on his side,
 ......but he had not been able to mention that they were mostly all young women, like witches, ......and committed their murders using strange magic.
If he had said that, it would only have caused the others to doubt his sanity.
...No, in fact, he himself still couldn\'t understand what he had seen, and was doubting his own sanity.
......But, regardless of sex or appearance, ......regardless of whether it was done with magic or a gun.
The fact that those girls had followed Kinzo\'s orders,
 and killed six people in an instant...was an unshakable truth......
If those people came to attack the guesthouse as well, ......what would happen?
Just closing the doors and windows like this was surely meaningless......
Gohda, ......as well as Kumasawa.
The only thing left for those two, who had witnessed that massacre in the dining hall,
 was to cradle their heads, not even knowing how to interpret what they had seen...
".........Kumasawa‐san, are you okay......?
 Want some tea......?"
"H‐hohohohoho...
 Thank you very much, yes, thank you...
 ...I\'m sorry, but may I be left with my thoughts for a little while.........?"
Maria tried to be nice, but it seemed that Kumasawa still wasn\'t able to clear away her confusion.
"......Maria, thanks for being considerate.
 Let\'s let Kumasawa‐san rest for now."
"......Uu."
Jessica too showed consideration for Kumasawa, certain of the shock she must have received after witnessing such a tragedy,
 ......but her imagination couldn\'t even come close to the impossible scene Kumasawa had witnessed...
Nevertheless, with her mother having been killed, and her father having been captured,
 there was no way that Jessica could stay calm either.
She sealed her anxiety and sadness using her anger towards Kinzo, and walked irritatedly around the room.
"............Kumasawa‐san.
 Is Mom really.........dead?"
"......Y‐yes......
 ......I\'ve never seen such a...horrible way to die before......"
"It\'s...not possible that she\'s still alive,
 .........and with treatment, we could save her,
 ......is it......?"
"...........................
 ......A‐.........after such a thing happened to her head, it\'s unimaginable that she could still be.........alive......"
".................................
 ......Well, yeah...
 ......If the head gets smashed,
 ......there\'s normally no need for treatment, is there......"
When Gohda had come flying into the guesthouse, overcome with agitation,
 he had told about the massacre in the dining hall without concealing anything.
......Except for the part about the witches and magic, which they themselves still could not believe.
In other words, they hadn\'t even sugarcoated the cold‐blooded way in which Natsuhi and the others had died.
......It was too late now, but Kumasawa regretted having obviously said too much......
However, while lightly shaking her head and with a slightly painful laugh, Jessica spoke.
"......No, if anything, I was able to stay level‐headed thanks to what you told us."
".........If you\'d avoided mentioning the part about her head being smashed,
 ...maybe I\'d have said that she could still be alive,
 then ran off towards the mansion, straight into Grandfather, ......and I might have been killed."
"......There\'s a chance that sliver of hope would\'ve been fatal.
 .........With that in mind, I\'m grateful."
"......I am deeply sorry.....
 I apologize for not choosing my words carefully..."
"Don\'t worry about it now.
 There\'s nothing we can do about Mom now......but Dad\'s still alive.
 Kanon‐kun and Shannon, and Auntie Kyrie and Doctor Nanjo too."
"......I want to save them somehow, so we shouldn\'t do anything unnecessary that might be a burden to them.
 ......The most helpful thing we can do right now might be to wait by the phone."
There could be a phone call asking them to create a diversion to facilitate their escape.
Or perhaps the others might learn their location, and call for rescue.
......Jessica understood that in order to act promptly when that time came, the only thing they could do for the time being was to wait in this room...
George, Battler, and Gohda returned, having finished checking all of the locks downstairs.
Each of the three was holding a bunch of different objects.
George had things like drinks, canned food, crackers, and other types of snacks that he had found in the lounge and pantry, as well as a first‐aid kit.
All consumables that would be indispensable while they were locked down.
Gohda had a large folding ladder and carpentry tools.
Those were so that, in the case of an emergency, they could nail over the door from the inside to seal it.
{n}If it came to that, the ladder was for escaping out the window.
Battler had brought up objects which could be used as weapons, such as blades and poles.
The kitchen knives went without saying; the disassembled table legs could be used as clubs;
 and the pole roughly the size of a person, which had been made by taking apart a hat stand,
 could surely be used as a spear, even though it had no point.
......There was a good possibility that the enemies were carrying guns, so it was dubious whether these would be of any use.
But it was still better than not having them, and if those things could provide at least a little peace of mind, then they could also expect some kind of calming effect from them.
Then, they placed beds and sofas from around the room up against the door, barricading it.
They didn\'t go so far as to seal it up with nails.
 ......There was still the chance that Krauss and the others would escape, and come to meet up.
They had apparently set up a barricade at the top of the stairs as well.
{n}It had been designed to create a racket, so it would work in place of a warning alarm as well.
It was apparently Battler\'s idea.
For that reason, they turned the TV off.
{n}.........So that if the first‐floor window were to be broken, they would know by the sound.
Once the switch had been turned off, all that was left was an eerie silence.
......The sound of the violent wind and rain.
 Were they going to have to spend the whole night in such crushing suspense?
The boat was meant to be coming tomorrow morning.
However, judging by the weather report, the typhoon was expected to continue all day tomorrow, and the boat probably wouldn\'t come.
......The typhoon would pass in the morning of the day after tomorrow.
In other words, the boat would be coming the morning of the day after tomorrow, ......as in, the morning of October 6th.
And right now, it was late at night, October 4th.
.........They would have to spend more than thirty hours on this island,
 with Kinzo turned cold‐blooded murderer and his weird companions prowling about......
Even with the shutters closed, there would definitely be a little bit of light seeping out.
It might let the enemy know that they were hiding here.
......Battler suggested that it might be best to turn off the lights.
But they had already been taken over by such a ghastly feeling just from turning the TV off.
.......There wasn\'t anyone who directly challenged his proposal, but then again, there wasn\'t a single other person who agreed to it.........
"......Uu.
 Can\'t watch TV?"
"Yeah, sorry, but you\'ll have to bear with it.
 ......We can\'t afford to miss the sound of the enemy breaking in."
"........................
 ......Boring."
Even though she had been told that her mother had died, Maria alone somehow didn\'t seem to feel an approaching sense of danger.
It seemed she was quite displeased with having the TV turned off.
.........Even with this bizarre situation in front of her, she can\'t share our sense of danger?
......Because she\'s so young?
To Battler right now, seeing that young girl act in a way that was even slightly out of place...
made him feel that there was something very eerie about Maria......
"All that said.
 .........There\'s nothing more to try.
 Do you think you\'ll be able to do anything about the bars?"
"......Unfortunately, they\'re tougher than I imagined.
 I don\'t know when these were made, but their durability is certainly up to snuff.
 These are truly made rather well."
Kyrie chuckled softly.
{n}......They had no moves they could make, but the mood had calmed just a little.
"......This place is just like where you place chess pieces once you\'ve captured them.
 ......There is nothing left we can do, then......?"
"Not so fast.
 It\'s still too early to give in.
 If we stop thinking, we might as well stop breathing, right?"
"Exactly.
 ......Chess pieces taken aside may have no purpose, but there\'s a great purpose for them in shogi.
 Just one captured pawn should be able to put pressure on the opponent."
"I see...
 But still, there\'s nothing that can be done about these bars......"
"For us, maybe.
 .........But, if we can pinpoint where this is and contact Gohda‐san, we might be able to get him to come and save us."
"I see...
 But that would mean forcing danger on Gohda‐san......
 And I would also be worried for the children in the guesthouse, without a full‐grown adult male..."
"If you\'re risk‐averse, biding your time until the situation improves again is not a bad idea.
 ......However, if you don\'t know when to cut your losses, what you have might become worthless scraps of paper.
 ......And what we have is our lives."
"Our dignity as parents, too, right?
 After talking big like that during the telephone call, and telling them that we\'d handle it and they should stay put, we can\'t just start asking for help right away.
 That would be very uncool.
 *giggle*."
"At this point, pride is already worth less than nothing.
 .........Why don\'t we put our heads together?
 Where is this?
 Is it really underneath the dining hall?
 Or else, is it a different place, separate from the mansion...?"
Krauss, Kyrie, and Nanjo began to discuss their plans.
Kanon was squatting by the bars, silently trying to sense anyone\'s presence.
 ......Just as he had been ordered.
Shannon came close to him, and they both squatted down together.
"............Do you sense someone?"
".........Yes.
 ......They aren\'t paying any attention in this direction, but there\'s somebody relatively close by."
"Is it {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}...?"
"............I think it\'s the goats.
 Their breathing is really noisy."
Kanon\'s ability to sense the presence of others was several levels above that of a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}.
He described their breathing as noisy, but Krauss and the rest couldn\'t even pick up the slightest hint of it.
......Therefore, even if he had simply reported it, they would merely have doubted his ears.
"...............They got us, didn\'t they."
".....................
 ......It\'s unusual.
 For us to be captured without being killed."
"This time, {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama didn\'t make her appearance.
 And the Master left his study.
 ......I don\'t have a clue what\'s going on..."
"I do.
 .........Whatever happens or changes, it\'s all for that witch\'s fickle entertainment.
 The result will be no different."
"I wonder if this time we\'ll be able to.........go to the Golden Land."
"Who knows.
 We have a high rate of losing."
"............Come to think of it, it\'s a rare thing that both of us survived the first twilight, isn\'t it?
 ......I get the feeling that it\'s incredibly unusual for us to be able to talk together like this even though the ritual has already begun."
"Maybe.
 ......But that\'s still just for the witch\'s entertainment.
 I\'m not thinking of it as anything other than her letting us live just a little longer to ridicule us, since we usually drop out right in the beginning."
"I wonder if........we\'ll be unable to reach the Golden Land again."
"I\'m sure we won\'t.
 ......If we hold onto any foolish hope, we\'ll get taken advantage of again."
"*giggle*.
 That\'s right.
 Last time you got taken advantage of."
"......I\'m an idiot."
Kanon made a sour look, and turned his head.
Shannon laughed softly, and apologetically leaned towards his shoulder.
"But......it\'s nice to hear that Milady is safe, isn\'t it?"
"......She\'s escaped the first twilight, that\'s all.
 ......She might just be being made to wait for an even crueler death in a later twilight."
"What about you, Nee‐san?
 ......Aren\'t you glad George‐sama\'s safe?
 It\'d be nice if you two could reach the Golden Land together."
".........Thanks.
 I wish the same for you and Milady as well."
"I, I don\'t have my hopes up.
 .........It\'s just as you say.
 All that witch is doing is having fun dangling prizes in front of people, and watching them flounder."
".........I\'m sure no one will be able to go to the Golden Land.
 ......If I was foolish enough to wish to reach the Golden Land with Milady,
 .........that witch would find that very fun to toy with, and would certainly never let us reach there."
"......You\'re right.
 .........{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama is thinking about which order of sacrifices will be the most interesting."
"The whole thing about them being chosen at random is just a blatant lie.
 That swindling witch...
 ......All that about having any wish you want granted in the Golden Land is probably just a lie."
"..................That\'s not true.
 The Golden Land is......a wonderful place."
"Have you been there?"
".........Only for a little bit.
 Though, even that was probably just {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama\'s joke."
"...............What\'s it like there?"
"Well.
 .........It\'s a wonderful place.
 ...I can\'t really explain it well.
 It\'s a world like a pleasant dream."
"A paradise‐like place, with roses blooming all over and beautiful butterflies dancing, or something like that?"
"......It\'s not a place with a tangible image like that.
 It really is like being in a dream.
 When you\'re there, it\'s very gentle, very peaceful,
 ......and you\'re allowed to sleep as long as you want, like when you wake up early on your day off, lying under the covers."
"......Sunlight comes in through the cracks in the curtains, and you think "I have to get up",
 but then you realize it\'s your day off, and you can go back under the covers again...it\'s a place where you can feel like that."
"I\'d feel annoyed that I got up at all.
 Getting up by accident even though it\'s your day off is something only you would do, Nee‐san.
 .........Go on?"
"Well.
 While I was there, I felt very contented, and very calm.
 But once you return to this world, you can\'t remember it well, even though you\'ve only just been there."
"It\'s a lot like when you can\'t remember a dream you were just having.
 ......But I still remember that it was a very calm and quiet world."
".........That\'s it?
 Wow, that Golden Land she\'s always bragging about isn\'t much special at all.
 ......I thought it was a place where all your wishes come true."
"It is.
 It\'s a place where all your wishes will be granted.
 .........Well, maybe that\'s not quite it.
 It might be better to say it\'s a place where you don\'t have to wish for anything."
"......For example, if you were cold, Kanon‐kun, and wished you had a jacket, you\'d be happy to be given one,
 but if you were in a warm room to begin with, there wouldn\'t even be a reason to want a jacket, right?"
"......That\'s what the Golden Land is like.
 There\'s no need to even wish for most wishes.
 It\'s a world released from everything, where everything is calm."
"You could even say it\'s a place that transcends the concept that having your wishes granted will bring happiness...a world released from everything."
"........................
 ......It sounds kind of religious."
"And there, everything is equal.
 All things with minds are equal.
 ......There are no {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s, nor furniture, nor witches.
 ......There, I was equal to everyone.
 There was no longer any need to feel ashamed of myself because I was furniture."
".........It was honestly a happy world where I was equal to all {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s, and even witches.
 I can\'t really remember it well,
 but I have the feeling that when I was there, I was equal even to {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama, and we were good friends."
"............If that witch is there, then it\'s not a much of a paradise."
".........So, you want to go to that blissful Golden Land with George‐sama.
 That\'s strange.
 The Golden Land is a utopia where you want for nothing, right?
 Wouldn\'t you be content even if George‐sama wasn\'t there?"
".....................
 ...The Golden Land is very calm, peaceful, and everything is fair and equal.
 ......But actually, happiness alone is left out."
"It isn\'t a happy world?"
"Of course, just by being peaceful, calm, and fair, it\'s an incredibly happy world.
 ......But I guess you could say that it\'s a world of zero, where you\'re released from all negative worries."
"The human world is filled with negatives, so of course a zero world is incredibly happy, ......but it\'s still zero.
 *giggle*, that\'s asking for a lot, isn\'t it?"
"......It\'s something like this.
 When you\'re nodding off on your quiet holiday morning,
 ......if the person you love the most is next to you, and they\'re holding your hand, then it can become an even greater, more wonderful happiness, .........something like that.
 ...Sorry, Nee‐san is horrible with analogies, I\'m too stupid."
"......So,
 to you, the greatest happiness would be reaching that world together with George‐sama."
"Yes.
 And I\'m sure that for you, it would be reaching that world together with Milady."
"The two will be released from their worries in a fair world...?
 .........It feels like I\'m being indoctrinated into some kind of strange religion.
 I imagined something more...worldly.
 A world where we would be given magic medicine, and that would make us be born again as {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s, or something more like that."
".........If you go, you\'ll understand.
 If {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama really is a fickle person, then surely some day, she\'ll let you get a glimpse of it too.
 ......Then you\'ll be able to understand my example."
"....................................
 Well, I\'m not holding my breath.
 ......At any rate, it seems like game over for us this time already.
 Maybe we can do better some other time."
"......You\'re right.
 If we have some strange hope, {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama will take advantage of us again.
 .........It might be best for us just to stop thinking, and entrust ourselves to fate."
".........We just need to be simple chess pieces.
 ......No matter what we think or don\'t think, we can\'t escape from the witch\'s chessboard.
 Our role is now just to wait and see how we\'ll be tortured to death.
 ......For us, the dream of the Golden Land is too unavailing."
"..................You\'re...right.
 ......Sorry......"
Kanon shrugged his shoulders, then told Shannon to leave him alone because she was interfering with his duty, distancing himself from her.
Realizing her thoughtlessness in bringing up such an inappropriate topic and instead hurting Kanon,
 Shannon bit her lower lip and stared at the ground...
She wouldn\'t bother him any more.
{n}She went off and squatted in a corner by herself.
".....................nn—"
At that moment, Kanon twitched.
{n}It was like the ears of a cat when it reacts to a faint sound.
"What\'s wrong?"
"......Shh.
 .........Krauss‐sama, somebody is coming."
"What?!"
They ended their conversation and strained their ears.
......For a while, they couldn\'t hear anything,
 but before long, they were able to hear the sounds of a large group of people walking...
"......So they\'ve come."
"The time of reckoning is upon us—or else, our first and final chance."
".........I shall talk to Kinzo‐san.
 ...I will try to find out where this place is somehow."
"We\'re counting on you.
 ..........................."
During the last phone call, Kyrie had asked what the time over at the guesthouse was.
......It had been the same as her watch, and by this she had learned that their watches hadn\'t been set back.
It wasn\'t just the clocks on the walls in the guesthouse.
{n}Several people\'s watches, including George\'s and Gohda\'s, had matched.
......If that was the case,
 then after the massacre in the dining hall, they had been transported to the dungeon in only a few minutes.
Not enough time had passed for them to be knocked out and carried away.
Then were those really pitfalls, meaning that this was the area directly under the dining hall......?
All they could do was pray that Nanjo could find out where this was...
"......They\'re coming.
 There\'s probably...four people.
 ......The Master, and three of those who appeared in the dining hall."
"OK, good.
 You come back here as well now.
 We\'ll deal with the rest."
"Shannon‐chan, sorry, but can I have you sit by the phone?
 Hide it with your skirt."
"Ah......yes...!"
The presence came closer, ......and there was the sound of a heavy door being opened at the other end of the corridor.
The light they were apparently carrying illuminated the dimly lit corridor, stroking the walls with razor‐sharp shadows.
And then, the light from the lantern they held lit up the prisoners through the bars.
......The bars\' sharp shadows divided them up lengthwise.
There were four figures there.
 .........It was Kinzo, ............Ronove, {f:5:Virgilia}, and Gaap.
"The head of the Ushiromiya family, Lord {f:5:Goldsmith}.
 Everyone, your silence, please."
"...............{f:5:Goldsmith}?"
"It\'s Father\'s pen name.
 It seems he always signs with it when writing those bizarre grimoires."
"‘Kinzo’ made English‐style?
 Shouldn\'t that be {f:5:Goldwarehouse}?"
".........Hahhahahahahahahahahaha.
 A warehouse is a place to keep things in and nothing more.
 Whereas I create gold, and use my craftsmanship to further increase its worth.
 Don\'t you think "smith" is much more fitting?"
"...............Certainly.
 I apologize for blathering."
"Kinzo‐san......
 ......Just what is going on?
 Where in the world is this...?"
"Oh, my friend.
 Can\'t you remember?
 Certainly, you may never have entered the prison, but you should remember walking through this corridor."
".........Huh,
 ............huh?
 ...............Y‐you don\'t mean........."
"......Do you have an idea?"
"But, no, .........that is inconceivable.
 ......Firstly, we fell through a pitfall, and furthermore, we were locked up in here after only a few minutes...
 ......Not only is the distance too great, that\'s physically impossible......"
"For a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}, right?
 *giggle*."
"Father... Is this the mansion?
 To think that the mansion had an underground area like this......"
"Kraussss.
 Wasn\'t there a place whose existence you all whispered of, and which you followed after me on numerous occasions trying to find?
 .........This is that place.
 No, to be correct, this is under that place.
 *cackle*cackle*...!"
"This place couldn\'t be............Kuwadorian\'s...
...basement...?!"
"......It is as you surmise.
 This is the basement of Kuwadorian."
"Kuwadorian......
 ......You don\'t mean...Father\'s rumored hidden mansion......?
 It really exists......?"
"This mansion was constructed for the sole use of my beloved witch, {f:5:Beatrice}.
 It is truly a shame that I cannot show you around the above‐ground section, as it is such a beautiful and elegant mansion."
".........How lovely, just the two of you alone in a mansion with this kind of room.
 It seems that you and I are differently inclined."
"......Kyrie‐san.
 ......It would be wise to refrain from such rude comments."
"*giggle*.
 But I agree.
 ......If a mansion I was given had this kind of dungeon in it,
 even a hundred‐year love would turn cold, and I\'d take anything of value and run for the hills."
"Pu ku ku.
 Oh? You have no interest in this sort of thing?
 And here I was thinking that you would go head over heels."
"Heheh.
 .........Of course I go head over heels.
 If I get a collar or something for a birthday present.
 ......But only if he\'s a stud."
"Puu ku ku ku ku!"
"Quiet!
 ......Don\'t you need a gag more than a collar?"
"Oh, even that\'s not off‐limits for you?
 You sure aren\'t picky, Lia.
 *giggle*......"
"Wh‐who gave you permission to shorten my name...?!"
"Enough, you noisy women!
 Are you telling me you\'d like to be locked up in the same cell?"
"I, I apologize, my lord...
 This old body of mine would not be able to stand such a cold prison..."
{f:5:Virgilia} quickly apologized, but Gaap merely laughed together with Ronove.
It was like she was saying that she wouldn\'t be captured,
 or else, that even if she were to be captured, it would be meaningless......
"A prison is a place where the captured cannot escape from.
 That implies the strong will and love to not let go for a lifetime.
 A woman who you could give up on if she ran away is not worth the word "love"."
"A woman who makes you fall so madly in love that you don\'t want to let her escape, to the point of binding her in chains...
 It is only upon reaching that level that it becomes a love worth sacrificing my life for.
 .........I will not ask you to understand."
".........I cannot be bound by anyone, and will not be bound.
 I don\'t want to be loved, I want to love.
 I feel the same as you, {f:5:Goldsmith}.
 That\'s why I understand the madness of your love."
"Love and madness are two sides of the same coin, or so they say.
 How bothersome."
".........But learning where we are so easily was a big step.
 We\'ll ask the details later, but it seems that you know about this place, right, Doctor Nanjo?"
"Y‐yes......
 ......If that corridor is the underground passage beneath Kuwadorian,
 .........then if we go straight there, it will become a long tunnel,
 ......and if we stay on that, we should be able to return to the mansion."
"......Then if we could just do something about these bars, we could go home."
"Father...
 What are you planning to do with us?"
"As I have already declared, you are the sacrifices for the later twilights.
 There are conveniently five of you here.
 You will be perfect as hostages for the five gougings."
"......I see.
 ...Then it\'s the time of reckoning for us, then?"
"Eventually.
 That\'s not why I\'m here this time, so relax.
 Besides, I believe I said it already.
 ......If one of my grandchildren is deemed suitable to inherit everything from me, then the ritual will be called off.
 In other words, your lives will be spared."
"......Wh‐what are you planning to do to the children?"
"To see if they are suitable to be my successor or not,
 I shall give them a test.
 If even one of them can impress me, I\'ll call the ritual off."
".........And if there isn\'t anyone suitable,
 ......what are you planning on doing with the children?"
"*cackle*cackle*cackle*!
 There\'s no need to worry about that.
 After all, you are the ones who will be made into sacrifices first.
 Anything after that should be of no concern to you."
"You simply need to place your fates in the hands of your own children.
 ......Your children, the fruit of what you\'ve birthed, taught and raised.
 They should truly be the most suitable to entrust with your fate...!"
"*cackle*cackle*!
 Don\'t make such a worried face, Kraaauss...
 Believe in the daughter that you brag is worth ten billion yen.
 Hehheheh, heh{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha...!!"
".........Exactly.
 Children are the fruit of their parents.
 Worthy of entrusting with the parent\'s fate.
 And Father, that applies even to you."
"......Heheh, hahhahahaha!
 This woman has guts, what a waste on Rudolf!
 Wahhaha{0}hahaha...!!"
"...Kyrie‐san, ......it would be best not to aggravate him too much."
"I agree.
 Let\'s bear with it for now......"
"That\'s right...
 ......After all, we\'re simply fish on a chopping board.
 There\'s nothing we can do now."
"Except insult me with such vigor.
 I don\'t dislike that kind of woman, you know?
 {f:5:Beatrice} was that kind of woman too, in the beginning.
 *cackle*cackle*cackle*!!"
"............My lord.
 Let us get to the main topic.
 We\'ve been getting derailed for a while now."
"Ah yes, there was that. Sorry, sorry, my friend.
 Well then, let\'s get to the main topic.
 For that, I\'ve prepared a phone.
 .......Shannon, very shrewd of you.
 You don\'t have to hide it any longer.
 I had that put there.
 *cackle*cackle*...!"
"M‐my apologies......"
"........................"
Shannon quickly withdrew, and the telephone was revealed...
"Krauss.
 Call the grandchildren in the guesthouse.
 And tell them of the test—of the start of my trial."
With a gesture that seemed to be saying "go ahead", Ronove urged Krauss to pick up the receiver.
"...............And if I say no?"
"Hohoh, and why do you think you\'re in a position where you can make a deal?
 If you don\'t call, then the grandchildren won\'t even be given a chance.
 The Ushiromiya family will end here.
 And I\'ll turn you all into sacrifices right away!!"
"You\'d be lucky to become sacrifices right away.
 ......Don\'t you think it\'d be more painful to watch the children be made into sacrifices first, before your very eyes...?"
"......Ga...ap.
 The Master is the one who decides the order of the sacrifices.
 Keep your opinions to yourself."
"Lia, you just tried to shorten my name and failed, didn\'t you?"
"I, I did not!
 And I told you not to shorten my name...!"
"......Women truly are..."
"Noisy. Pu ku ku!"
