"......I don\'t know why you\'re angry, Battler."
"You {i:should?!}
 Everyone was killed, goddammit!!
 By that goddamned old fart!
 Saying something incomprehensible about {f:5:Beatrice}\'s resurrection ritual or something!!"
"Then, that means, thirteen people have been offered as sacrifices,
 ......and {f:5:Beatrice} will have revived already, you know?"
"Yeah, that\'s perfect!!
 I\'ll take {f:5:Beatrice} too and kill them both!!"
"............We survived the ritual.
 So we\'ll receive an invitation to the Golden Land from {f:5:Beatrice}, you see......?"
"All wishes are granted there.
 If you\'re suffering because your family was killed, then you just have to bring them back to life.
 ......That\'s what I plan to do.
 I\'m going to revive my really nice real mama, the one that isn\'t possessed by the black witch."
"......So Mama will always be with me from now on.
 .........There won\'t be any more overtime or working on days off.
 ...She\'ll always be with me, and think only of me, kihhihihi, and she\'ll fight all the time against fearsome enemies for me.
 Kihhihi{0}hi{0}hihihi...!"
"......There\'s something wrong with you.
 ......How can you sit there saying such incomprehensible crap in a situation like this...?!"
"............Didn\'t Auntie Kyrie just tell you, Battler...?
 ......Didn\'t she tell you...
to believe...
...in the witch?"
".....................Sh‐shit.
 This isn\'t the time to get in an argument with you...!!
 Forget "hostages", at this point, there\'s no one left alive at all!
 This dumb‐as‐hell, screwed‐up ritual game is done now...!!"
"From here on, I\'m doing what {i:I} want.
 Someone might still be alive.
 Or someone might be hiding!
 I\'ll search every nook and cranny of this place, find them, and beat the shit out of them!!"
In a rage, Battler grabbed his hat‐stand spear and flew out of the room.
Maria watched him go, looking bored...
".........But {f:5:Beatrice} would grant your wishes soon anyway.
 ......Stupid Battler.
 ......Kihhihihihi."
Then, the phone rang out again......
Maria stood up, and grabbed the receiver.
"Uu.
 Hello.
 ......Uu?
 Uu!!!"
Of course, the sound of the phone also reached Battler\'s ears as he was about to dash out of the guesthouse.
With a violent forcefulness, he turned around and dashed into the cousins\' room...
"M‐Maria......!
 The phone call, ......who\'s it from...?!"
With a terrifying look on his face, Battler yelled at Maria, who was on the phone.
You couldn\'t blame him......
 Right now, the only humans left alive on the island were himself, Maria, Gohda, and Kumasawa.
But there was no way those two could call when they were locked up in the gardening storehouse.
......Which meant.........there was only one person.
{n}It had to be Kinzo.
As she happily chatted with the person on the other end of the phone, Maria slowly turned to face Battler.
.........And, with an unsettling expression on her face, she laughed with a "kihihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihihi".
{n}......It felt almost as though the person on the other end of the line was chatting about Battler.
"Maria...who\'s on the phone?
 ......Grandfather......?!"
Battler couldn\'t imagine that this was the case.
...After all, it was inconceivable that Maria would be having such a friendly talk with Kinzo,
 ......chatting to him about Battler with that eerie smile on her face.
Just what kind of person could be on the phone.........who could make Maria chat with a smile like that?
.........At that time, in the back of his mind, the words Kyrie had spoken to him drifted up.
Even if a witch does appear, there is no need to doubt it.
{n}......Just.........believe in its existence......
"Yep.
 Battler just came back.
 He sure is hasty.
 Kihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihihi......"
"Maria!!
 Who\'s on the phone?!
 Who?!?!"
"......Hand it over?
 Sure.
 ............Here, Battler."
After getting the consent of the person on the other end, she held the receiver out to Battler...
"..................uh."
"Here."
Maria held the receiver out for him to take, ......as though it was perfectly normal.
Battler felt just a little bit of hesitation towards taking the receiver.
......Because, .........by acknowledging the existence of the person at the other end,
 .........he would have no choice but to admit it.
.........Kyrie had said it.
......There is no longer...
...any need...
...to doubt their existence...
Battler took the receiver.
After he did so, Maria briskly headed for the door.
Battler, who was slightly fearful about finding out for sure who was at the other end of the receiver,
 questioned Maria before taking the call.
"H‐hey!
 Where are you going...?!"
"To where my test is.
 ......I wonder who the Ushiromiya family head will be, you or me.
 Kihihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihi."
".........D‐don\'t go!!
 You\'ll be killed!!"
"No I won\'t.
 The ritual\'s already over.
 ...And even if I am, I\'ll be revived.
 ......Whether one of us becomes the head or not, we\'re already invited to the Golden Land.
 See you."
"Wait!!
 Maria...!!!"
Battler stretched his hand out to Maria\'s back as she left,
 ......but the cord of the receiver that he was gripping held him back like a chain.
......He readied himself.
 ...Battler put the receiver to his ear......
"...............He‐......hello......?"
"<Congratulaatioooooooons>!!
 <And I\'m fi~ne>!!
 <And yoo{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}oouuuuu>?!
 Aaa{0}a{0}ah{0}h{0}h{0}hyah{0}hyah{0}hyah{0}hyaaaaa!!!"
Screwed up, mocking English filled his ears.
{n}......It was the voice of a woman he didn\'t know.
......Who—
the inside of his head was starting to freeze up—
............who............
"What do you mean "who", Ushiromiya Battleeeeer...?
 The answer, normally, is <ye~s, I\'m fine>!
 Is it not??
 That takes me back...you must have done that one in middle school, right?
 That thing you do in pairs!
 Uhhya{0}hya{0}hya{0}hya{0}hya{0}hyaaaaahh!!!"
"Y‐...you\'re insane......
 Who are you?!!
 Answer me!!!"
"Say it in Engliiish.
 Isn\'t that your specialtyyyyy?"
"......Qui‐quit messing with me......
 Who are you?!!
 That crazy old bastard\'s underling?!"
"‘Underling’ is a cruel description.
 Go the other way and try "captive".
 ......I have Kinzo captive!
 Ri~~ght?
 Wahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha..."
That last laugh didn\'t sound like it was aimed at Battler.
......It was almost as though Kinzo was right next to the phone, cackling as well...
"......S‐......say your goddamned name!!
 Who are you?!
 Who?!!!"
"Try and guess, you could win a invite to Hawaii!
 Ahhyah{0}hyah{0}hhyaaaah!!
 Fffinally.
 FINALLY!!
 Mmmmmmm, it was soooo looo{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}ong, the days leading up to today were reee{-}e{-}eeally long...!!"
"I seriously waited a thousand years, you know?? For this day to arrive!!
 And here it is, all thanks to you,
 my BIG resurrection!!
 <Thank you>, Kinzo!
 Just this once,
 I\'ll let you have that last takeback of yo~urs!!!"
"......Hell\'s bells, do you have to be in this much of a good mood?
 Can\'t you act a little more ladylike?"
Kinzo and {f:5:Beatrice} sat facing each other over the chessboard on the reception table.
Also on the table were expensive cheeses and the like to go with drinks.
{n}And there was a line of several empty wine bottles.
As {f:5:Beatrice} rolled around in her sofa in an unseemly way,
 she held a wine glass in one hand, in a good mood,
 ......and probably, completely drunk.
"I\'m in the {i:best} mood today, so I\'m feeling crazy generous!!
 Hey, hey, Kinzo, don\'t use a well‐aged noble rot wine like this as a decoration!
 Hooooly shit, it\'s a 1947?!"
"If you don\'t open it today, just when are you gonna open it?!
 Let\'s slosh it all over each other for fun!
 Then let\'s whack each other with the empty bottle!
 Uhhyah{0}hyah{0}hyahhya!!"
"Hahhaha, that would be entertaining.
 You are a little too excited.
 You\'re cutting loose too much."
"And what about youuuuuu?!
 Aren\'t you happy to be reunited with meee?
 Aaah, it\'s the living world! The earthly world!!
 Long live my flesh!!"
"......What......are you going on about.........?
 ...Are you saying that you\'re......B‐{f:5:Beatrice} or something...?"
"<Ye~eeeeeeeeeeeeeeess, I aaaaaaaaaamm>!!
 Thanks to Kinzo\'s thirteen‐person murder ritual, I\'ve finally been resurrected...!!
 It\'s nice having a mouth, it\'s nice having a tongue!
 How fun it is to be able to talk to you like this!"
"Come to think of it, even though we\'ve hurled insults at each other over and over again,
 this is the first time we\'ve had a conversation like this on the board during the game, isn\'t it?
 How very fresh!!"
"Oh, did you hear that pop sound?!
 He {i:opened} it, the maniac actually went and opened that vintage wine that\'s expensive as shit!!
 Do you know how much a single bottle of that stuff {i:costs}?!
 As much as a whole ten‐kilogram ingot, isn\'t that craaaaaazy?!?!
 Hiiiii‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah!!"
"C‐cut the crap...!!
 {f:5:Beatrice} my ass...!!
 You say you\'re the Golden Witch?!
 That\'s enough!!"
"Where the hell are you?!
 Is that damn old fart with you as well?!
 I\'ll beat the shit out of both of you!!
 Where are you right now?!
 Answer me!!"
"Ohhh, so you want to meeeet me?
 Uhhihihihi, sure is tough being a popular woman!
 But please, don\'t try to chat me up when Kinzo\'s around, okaay?
 The guy\'s a bad egg, he gets seriously jealous, see?"
".........But when Kinzo isn\'t around and we\'re all alone, I\'ll love you all you want in secret, alright...?
 Uhyaaahya{0}hhya{0}hhya{0}hhya{0}hhya{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}kkya{0}kkya{0}kkyakkya!!!"
"Y‐you\'re insane........."
"Kinzoo, I\'ve changed my mind.
 I won\'t do Maria\'s test.
 You go."
"How fickle.
 Then you are saying that you will do Battler\'s test?"
"Nothing wrong with that, ri~ght?!
 That guy\'s so much like a younger you, y\'know? It makes my heart race."
"Don\'t worry, I\'m not gonna cheat on yooooou.
 I\'ll only be alone with him this one time.
 ......I\'m always alone with you, riiight...?
 But no more tying me up twenty‐four hours a day, alright?
 Kuhhyahha{0}hha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha...!!!"
"So there you have it, Battlerr!
 I, the Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice}, will be running your test myself!
 As for the place...let me see.
 At the front entrance to this mansion!"
"Battlerr, this headship test, you\'ve seriously gotta full‐ass this one, okaay?
 ......I mean, Kinzo\'s practically dead on his feet.
 If you become the next head, you\'ll be the new owner of everything on this island."
"......I wouldn\'t mind letting you have me all to yourself, you know......?
 Just like Kinzo did, ......control me, okay......?
 Kuhhihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihi, uhhya{0}hha{0}hha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha!"
"Th‐the front entrance of the mansion......
 Perfect...!!
 Listen to me, you stinking drunk!!
 I\'ll sober you up.
 And I\'ve got some {i:hot punch} waiting to help you through your hangover!!
 Just you wait!!"
Battler impulsively slammed the receiver down.
{n}There was no need to talk through a receiver anymore.
......I\'ll meet her face to face and settle this!!
I took the spear I\'d made by taking apart the hat stand,
 and went outside without even an umbrella.
......It\'s hard to imagine that the young woman calling herself {f:5:Beatrice} will be waiting for me alone.
...I should probably assume that she\'ll be waiting with those supporting troops that Gohda‐san and Kumasawa‐san told us about.
Going alone would be too reckless...
"Gohda‐san, Kumasawa‐san...!
 It\'s me, it\'s Battler...!"
I headed for the gardening storehouse first.
{n}I need all the help I can get.
Gohda‐san\'s a burly man, so I can probably count on him to add some extra brawn.
{n}Kumasawa‐san\'s knowledge and familiarity with the area as a senior servant might prove to be a huge weapon.
Both of them have master keys, and they know more about the mansion than I do.
 ......They\'re pretty reliable allies.
As I banged on the shutter and called out for them to open it, I remembered that there was nothing they could do from the inside.
I would have to get the key back from them and open the shutter myself.
I went around to the side, knocked on the small latticed window there, and opened it up.
"Gohda‐san, Kumasawa baa‐chan...!
 It\'s Battler...!!
 Hey, come on, get up...............h...ey........."
The scene in the shed, lit by a dim lightbulb, .........was all too......bizarre......
"......Gohda...
sa...n......
 ......Kumasawa......sa...
......n........."
From a low ceiling beam...
......hung two thick ropes,
 ......and at the ends,
 ......Gohda‐san and Kumasawa‐san...
.........were hanging...by their necks.....
It was dim, and I was looking through a narrow gap between all the various pieces of equipment strewn about, so I couldn\'t make out any more detail than that.
......But when they showed not even a tremor after I called out to them,
 and because of the way the loops around their necks seemed to carry the full weight of their bodies, I could sense no trace of life from them......
"You\'ve got to be............kidding me......right............?
 ......Why........."
The shutter is still closed.
......And there\'s only a single key, which I\'m sure Gohda‐san took possession of.
So how did the culprit......open the shutter and kill the two of them inside......?
No wait, they weren\'t necessarily killed...
{n}If this is a suicide......
......That way, this locked room makes sense, but I don\'t know why the two of them would hang themselves...!!
Feebly, ...I slumped down on the spot.
Now, the only humans alive on this island...
...are me, Maria,
 ......and my old bastard\'s old bastard.
.........No, there\'s also that nutso woman calling herself {f:5:Beatrice}...
Maria\'s been acting like she\'s on the witch\'s side from the beginning.
{n}And Gramps is the very person who revived the witch.
{n}Plus there\'s the witch herself.
......What the hell... .........Then, it\'s just as though...
.........I\'m the only one on this island............
Using my pole as a cane, I feebly rose to my feet.
......Damn, I can\'t do it like this...
{n}I\'ve got to avenge...everyone......
"Damn iiiiiiiit...... This is no good...
 Yeah, it\'s no good, it\'s no goddamn good at all...
 Damn iiiiiiiiiiiiitt........."
I got the crying out of the way while I could...
 So that all my weak emotions would be squeezed out with my tears...
Then, ......I straightened up, and gazed into the darkness in the direction of the mansion.
.........At the entrance to the mansion, the witch is waiting.
I\'ll go, ......and settle this.
I\'ll find the source of this weird, blood‐soaked night, ......and crush her with my own hands...!
Amidst the pouring rain, ......I walked through the rose garden without an umbrella, letting myself get soaked.
......I could see the arbor in the distance.
According to Jessica, it seemed that George‐aniki had also been killed...
Well, by this point, there\'s no need to worry about the lives of any hostages.
{n}......I left the path, aiming for the arbor.
Then,
 ............I saw George‐aniki\'s weather‐beaten corpse...
"...............Aniki......
 ............Shit............"
The corpse was in front of the arbor.
If he could have died under the arbor, he would at least have been spared being beaten down upon by the rain...
There was a gaping hole in Aniki\'s forehead, as though he had been shot with a gun.
Perhaps because the rain had washed everything away, his face wasn\'t covered with blood, ......and so he looked almost like he was sleeping.
...However, the deep red his clothes were stained still provided the evidence that a large amount of blood had flowed out...
How happy I\'d be if he were sleeping, or else pretending to be dead...
......But Aniki\'s eyes remained open, even though the rain sprayed against them.
......And......the hole in his forehead was, without a hint of a joke,
 ......the real thing...
There had been a faint chance...
that Gohda‐san and Kumasawa‐san hanging by their necks in the gardening shed could have been a bad joke.
But that naive possibility had now been completely denied.
And, as I looked at this corpse, I became completely sure.
Just as Gohda‐san had once said.
 ......The enemy came to take lives as though these lives were pieces on a chess board.
".........Yeah, ......there\'s no mistake.
 ......It seems that old geezer and the witch...
......really don\'t view our lives as anything more than that......"
...That damn witch, when she was on the phone...
{n}She talked about us like we were "on the game board"......
"...Perfect......
 ......Right, she thinks this is a game, huh......
 Then, ...in the same way you killed everyone like it was a game,
 .........it\'s alright if I kill all of you like it\'s a game as well, right......?"
"............Just you wait......
 ......{f:5:Beatrice}........."
The lightning caused the mansion\'s vast shadow to emerge.
......Finally, ......the mansion.
As the massive shape came into view, there was no silhouette of any person.
{n}It seemed that there weren\'t any underlings waiting for me in a pack, or anything like that.
.........According to Kyrie‐san, there were a large number of attendants with goat heads.
At least for now, I couldn\'t sense...
any large group like that hiding and staring at me...
What\'s this......?
{n}Beneath the roof of the entrance,
 .........there\'s something set down.
"......What is this?
 .........A...box?"
It looked like the kind of small box that girls often keep trinkets in.
......Or maybe it was the same kind of extravagant cigar case you\'d find in a reception room.
Either way, it didn\'t look like something that belonged here...
{n}It clearly looked......as though I was being told to open it.
But the thought of doing what they wanted me to do was somehow irritating.
{n}......However, it didn\'t look like we\'d get anywhere if I didn\'t open it.
Could it be that it\'s set up with some trap to make it explode when opened......?
While thinking things like that, and forgetting even to go under the overhang,
 I continued to glare at the box as the rain beat down upon me.
Then, .........mixed in with the thunder, was some kind of......music?
 ...It sounded like something like that.
......It was the tone of the big clock in the hall announcing midnight.
It was also the sound that announced that the crazy day of October 4th had finally ended,
 ......and that the much more incredibly crazy day of October 5th had begun.
That sound quietened, ............and I could hear an eerie laugh coming out of nowhere......
I got the feeling that the voice was coming from the heavens, ......and I looked up at the sky.
......And there.........was a woman I had never seen before.
{n}No, it\'s not true that I\'ve never seen her before.
{n}......I saw her once today.
Yes, in the portrait inside the mansion......
The clothes were different, ......but that face was just like the witch of the portrait......
Aaah, who am I kidding... I already know who this person is...!!
"......S‐......so you are {f:5:Beatrice}!!!"
"Yooohooooooooo, Battleeeeeeeeeeeeer...!!"
Leaning over the second floor balcony, ......and waving cheerily from under her umbrella,
 ......was, without a doubt, ......the witch of the portrait, ...{f:5:Beatrice}.........!!
Was the plan for the boss to watch on from above as her goat underlings torture me to death...?!
I adjusted my grip on the spear,
 and, imagining goats creeping out of the surrounding shadows and the entrance and surrounding me, I raised my guard in all directions...
"Ahhaha, be at ease, there\'s no one here but you and me, see?
 There is no goat furniture, there are no demon butlers; Master is not here, nor my close demon friend."
"And there are none of the gold butterflies that help compose my physical form, there are no magic circles, and no summoners in attendance!!
 ......Do you know what this means?"
"Not a clue.
 Quit babbling..."
"I have in fact met you several times even in this world.
 Almost as though brushing past one another, meeting only for a moment.
 ......As you know, this world of {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s is filled with a toxin just by your existence and your doubting of me."
"Almost like solid ramparts strengthening the defense around you, the king!
 And through multiple games,
 I advanced my pieces one by one, splitting you apart, and cornering you, undermining your ramparts bit by bit."
"Then, finally, once I opened a tiny crack, I sent a bishop in, so that it could approach right up next to you.
 .........But as you know, bishops are pieces with blind spots."
"As long as you stay on the black squares, a black bishop can exert massive influence upon you,
 but if you escape just one step to a white square, then even if I close in right next to you, I will not be able to touch you."
"That is why I have progressed through these games by sending in various pieces so that you cannot stay on a white square,
 forcing you out in front of me, the one who controls the black squares next to you."
"Howeeever!!"
"There are now holes opened all over your ramparts,
 and I was at last able to send in, not a bishop, but a full queen!!
 Do you know what kind of piece a queen is?"
"A rook plus a bishop.
 ......Is this what you\'re trying to say?
 ...Now, you not only control the black squares that are the witch illusions, but have also become able to encroach upon the white squares of the human world at will...?!"
"That is correct!!
 Where there exist the gold butterflies that are my minions, you have been labeling those squares as witch illusions,
 denying them under the hypothesis that they are observerless nonreality, am I right...?
 *cackle*cackle*, I am well aware......!!"
"For that very reason, I have at last descended thus upon the squares of white!!
 Worry not, I\'ll call plenty of gold butterflies, goats, demons, and witches later on!
 If you wish, I will invite you to my Golden Land!!"
"There, I will grant you any wish that you desire...!!
 Wahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha...!!"
"......It\'s starting to look like someone knocked an ink bottle over the chessboard of this island."
"I see, that too is a pleasant description...!
 *cackle*cackle*, soon, you will be covered in that ink as well.
 Before long, you will become dyed pitch‐black, and surely become a black king...!
 At this point, you are a pitiful existence drowning in a sea of ink, are you not?"
"No, I\'m not.
 I\'ll admit that the island has been stained completely black from your ink bottle,
 ......but there\'s still a white square left."
"Hoh, and where...?!!"
"Right under my feet.
 .........Your magic ink may try to cover the entire island, but it can\'t cover the ground my feet are standing on.
 ...Even if this island seems to be stained pitch‐black at a glance, I am me.
 I am here, with my feet firmly planted on a white square!!"
It\'s strange...
 Until a second ago, I was trembling all over.
......But now that she\'s appeared openly right before my eyes like this, my terror has actually lessened.
It\'s funny.
 Ghosts are most terrifying when you can only sense them.
When you can see them, and they have a face you can plant your fist into, there\'s nothing scary about it...!!
......However, she is definitely not a funny or a friendly person.
......She can kill me instantly while rolling around giggling, just by snapping a finger.
Whether we interpret the result of her snapping her fingers as magic flying at me or underlings showing up to shoot me, it doesn\'t matter.
......In any case, whether this is fantasy or mystery,
 that queen is in a position where she can kill me just by snapping her fingers......!
...I see, ......so this is the meaning...
......of the queen of this island,
 ...who reigns over both the white and black squares......?!
"Now then.
 It might be interesting to wait until you catch a cold in all that rain, but it\'s about time to move to the matter at hand.
 .........I am sure that you can tell there is a box there?
 Your test is inside of it."
"Hold it.
 ......After all that\'s happened, I\'m not interested in some stupid game about who\'ll be the next head."
"My game is to take you and the old man, ......and all the rest of you guys who killed everyone, and give every one of you a full‐on punch to the face."
"Hoh.
 So you will fly through the sky up to my balcony?
 Very good, very good, *cackle*!
 Come on then, up you come already, come on come on, up up!"
"......Damn you, acting like you\'re hot shit just \'cause you\'re in a completely safe place...
 I\'m coming up there right now, so you better be prepared!!"
"Aah, no, no, no.
 It\'s all locked up.
 Of course, the shutters are down for all the windows as well.
 My castle isn\'t so fragile that a single knight like you could break in!"
I tried the front door anyway just in case, ......but, yup, it really was locked.
{n}When I looked around, I noticed that indeed the shutters were closed on the windows.
......Normally, they wouldn\'t be.
"......Tch.
 Looks like you prepare for everything.
 ......Where\'s the key?!"
Gohda‐san and Kumsawa‐san probably have master keys, but they\'re in the locked room of the gardening storehouse.
......I can only give up for now...!
"Damn......
 ......Guess she\'s no fool herself."
"Are you really so dying to be right by my siiiide?
 Alright, if you pass your test with flying colors, why don\'t I grant you an audience?
 If you pass, then you will be the successor, and my new master after Kinzo."
"......My body and soul will be yours to do with as you will.
 Because I am ultimately the Ushiromiya family\'s furniture!
 Ah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah!!"
"............Well,
 it looks like you want to make me take this test no matter what.
 ......Alright.
 I\'m game.
 ...If I pass, my first prize will be a punch to your face."
"Scary, scaary...
 But it\'s not like I mind being controlled by violence, you see?
 {i:Grab}...onto my head!
 Make my face twist in pain, violate me in the same way a hawk tears apart and scratches at its prey with its talons...!!"
"Aaah, remind me of Kinzo in his younger days once more...!!
 That single time in my thousand‐year life!
 Remind me of that day I was taught the joy of being controlled, of submitting and being reduced to furnituuuuuuuure!!
 Uhyaaa{0}hhya{0}hhya{0}hhya{0}hhya!!"
"......You damn drunk, we aren\'t getting anywhere."
Ignoring the stupidly smiling witch, I picked up the box.
"Yes.
 Open it.
 Inside is a letter.
 Read it."
"........................"
I opened it.
 ......There was a faint smell of cigarettes.
{n}Apparently, it really had originally been a cigar case.
{n}But there were no cigarettes or cigars inside.
Instead, there was a Western envelope with the One‐winged Eagle crest.
{n}And when I opened that too, ......there was a letter inside.
I looked up at the witch.
 She was grinning down at me.
......It seemed she was waiting in anticipation to see what kind of reaction I\'d have to the contents.
......Dammit, I\'ll show her.
 Its contents were like this...
{a:c:{e:070:Among the three mentioned below.
{n}In order to gain two, sacrifice one.
{n}{n}1. Your life
{n}2. __\'s life
{n}3. Everyone else\'s lives
{n}{n}If you do not choose one, all of the above will be lost.}}
".........The heck is this?
 Some pretty creepy stuff\'s written here.
 And most importantly, the second one is blank, so I don\'t even know whose life."
"Mm.
 That second one is where you put the name of the one that person loves the most.
 For Jessica\'s test, it was Kanon\'s name, and for George\'s test it was Shannon\'s name."
"......Since they had obvious feelings for certain people, I was able to write those names in beforehand,
 but I don\'t know who you have feelings for.
 So I didn\'t know whose name to write, and left it blank."
"That\'s perfect.
 I love you, {f:5:Beatrice}.
 I\'ll stick your name in here.
 So my choice is going to be number two.
 Is that alright?"
"Hey, hey, quit joking, quit joking.
 Come onnn, please, Battler.
 Tell me the name of the person you have feelings for.
 If you don\'t, then this won\'t be a test, right?"
"Too bad.
 I don\'t have any woman in particular.
 Even if I did, why the hell would I tell you?"
"In that case, this test will not work for you.
 Hmmm, what a shame, what a shame.
 And I was really wondering what kind of woman was your cup of tea!
 *cackle*cackle*!"
".........What if I said I like young, flat‐chested girls with long, black hair.
 You don\'t match in a single area, do you?"
"Lies, you breast sommelier!
 You prefer a blonde bombshell with a <dynamite body>, don\'t you?!
 I am precisely the embodiment of your ideal, *cackle*cackle*!"
"If guessing your three sizes is the test to become the successor, I\'ll take it gladly."
"Ah, yes.
 This was the test to choose the successor.
 Chatting with you is so much fun that I\'ve been getting a bit off topic."
"......Then let us begin the headship test.
 I will question you to see whether you are qualified to be the next Ushiromiya family head.
 Answer with care."
The witch, who had been joking around like she was drunk until a second ago, suddenly regained her gravitas.
......She looked as though she truly had stepped out of that imposing portrait...
".........I am the Ushiromiya family alchemist, the Golden Witch and the Endless Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}."
"......Do you have the qualifications to inherit the Ushiromiya family headship and all of my gold—
that is what I will test.
 .........State your name."
"............Ushiromiya...Battler."
Under that majestic gaze, unimaginable from her manner a short while ago,
 I answered without any hesitation.
......She truly was......yes, indeed,
 ......in the truest sense, she was that worthy of calling herself the queen of this island.
"Very good, Ushiromiya Battler.
 .........However, you have thrown away that Ushiromiya name for the past six years, have you not...?
 Why is that...?"
".........mgh............
 ......Because I\'d had enough of my dad, the old bastard."
"I know.
 It was because you felt your father\'s remarriage disgraced the death of your mother, whom you loved and respected, yes...?"
"I see, you have no blood relation to your new mother whatsoever.
 It is not as though I cannot understand why you would feel unable to accept that mother.
 ......However, no matter who your father remarries with, that does not change the fact that his blood runs in your veins, correct?"
".........What\'s your point?"
"I can, to an extent, understand the childishness which led you to oppose your father\'s remarriage out of a desire to have him all to yourself."
"However, was throwing away the Ushiromiya name as a means of resistance not a disgrace to your family and blood?"
".........You were born and raised Ushiromiya, were you not?
 Do you think you were qualified to forget that debt and throw away the Ushiromiya name?"
"......It has nothing to do with you.
 This is between me and Dad...!"
"The Ushiromiya name does not belong to you and your father alone.
 You are a child who simply rebelled, unable to forgive the fact that your father was to be stolen away by an unknown woman.
 ......Those six years during which you forsook the Ushiromiya register were a significantly long period where you dragged the Ushiromiya name through the mud.
 Know the depths of your sinfulness."
"..................Well, sorry I\'m so childish..."
"However.
 Even though it was prompted by the deaths of your grandparents, I do commend you for returning to the Ushiromiya register.
 Accordingly, I shall give you a chance to purify yourself of that sin.
 Now is the time to atone for your sin of six years ago."
"Come, try to remember, remember your own sin.
 Remember it, confess, and repent.
 ............That shall be my test for you."
......At that moment, a massive thunderclap rang out, making my mind go blank.
"..............................
 ......Repent? ...What?
 .........Are you trying to tell me to apologize?"
".........The test has already begun.
 You may think as you wish."
There were no signs from the witch\'s expression that she was sneering at a person unable to answer the tough question thrust upon them.
{n}......She was earnestly asking something of him, and he could even feel a quiet determination.
Even as the rain beat upon him, Battler could not shift his eyes from her gaze.
......The witch threw her umbrella away.
{n}She abandoned herself to the falling rain.
So that the rain would fall on her until Battler answered that question.
......She had chosen to join him, allowing the rain to beat down on her as well, until he reached an answer.
For some reason, Battler could tell that.
{n}......But, even so, ......he didn\'t understand.
"W‐......well, ...uh.
 ......I mean, you\'re right, I do think I was being childish...
 All things considered, just \'cause Dad got remarried, that doesn\'t wipe out what I owe him for raising me."
"......I hear Dad always kept on sending money over for my living expenses,
 ......and he even said he wanted to be involved in my school events.
 .........The only reason he couldn\'t come is......I told Grandma and Grandpa not to let him come no matter what......"
"......................................."
"......A‐and yeah, ......if you want to just be blunt and say I was being childish and rebellious, I can\'t argue with that.
 .........But you know, ...in that case,
 ......Mom, ......Ushiromiya Asumu, who\'s gonna set things right for her...?!
 Mom was so devoted to our family, and did the very best she could...!"
"But Dad was cheating with Kyrie‐san.
 He even got her pregnant with Ange...!
 And then the moment she was born, he rushed them both into his register."
"......What is that if not a betrayal of Mom?!
 Who\'s gonna set things...
right...
for her?!!"
"......But what you\'re saying is also right.
 Even though the cheating was a fact, I still owed him for raising me."
"So I thought I\'d cancel those two things out and leave the family, what\'s the problem with that?!!
 That\'s right, I had the right, ......no, the duty to wallop Dad in Mom\'s place, didn\'t I?!"
"I let him get away without that!
 I left without saying anything, as though I hadn\'t been there in the first place!!
 And Dad forgot about me and started a new family with Kyrie‐san and Ange!
 That settles everything, doesn\'t it?!!"
But six years passed after that.
 ......Time healed the anger.
Kyrie‐san understood my anger as well,
 and she tried hard to interact with me despite that, and soften my heart.
Ange didn\'t know anything about the situation,
 and she adored me, believing that I was her real big brother who just lived in a separate house.
......As for Dad, he was acting like nothing had happened, and told me I could come home any time I wanted.
"It started to feel more and more stupid keeping it all going!!
 I thought it was about time for me to cool my head as well.
 So I said to Dad that if he apologized, I\'d call it water under the bridge.
 On the day of Grandpa\'s funeral."
"And that guy, he actually put both his hands on the floor and apologized...!!
 I couldn\'t believe how pathetic he looked...!"
"My dad, who was all about looking cool, actually bowed his goddamn head to me...!
 ......When I saw that, it felt like it\'d be stupid to keep it up any longer."
"I\'m sure Mom would\'ve thought the same thing!
 Every time Dad and I fought, Mom would always laugh and mediate for us.
 "Oh, that silly thing is what you were fighting over?"
 she\'d say.
 ......I could feel Mom saying that and laughing...!!"
"That\'s why,
 ......while I couldn\'t bring myself to say "I forgive you",
 .........I thought it might be alright to start over again from zero.
 So I decided to wind everything back to how it was six years ago.
 .........And I returned to the Ushiromiya family register...!!
 I\'d cried, raged, and stressed over it for a whole six years!"
"It might have been the same for Dad, and maybe even for my dead mom.
 Maybe Kyrie‐san and Ange too.
 ......So we went back to zero, and I returned to being Ushiromiya Battler!!!
 That\'s my immediate family\'s problem,
 ......and has nothing the hell to do with the Ushiromiya family!!"
"You aren\'t qualified to judge that to be a sin, and I have no duty to show repentance to you!
 If there was anyone I should have done that for, you\'ve already killed them!!"
"So I won\'t apologize for anything!
 I won\'t repent!!!
 That is my answer for this test!!!"
"..........................................
 ......Is that all...?"
"What.........?
 .................."
I had pretty much fully responded to her provocation,
 and I was sure that I\'d vented out all the stuff that I\'d been keeping inside my chest, stuff I hadn\'t wanted to show anyone.
That was what the witch had supposedly been hoping for, too.
 ......And yet, the witch\'s blank expression didn\'t change in the slightest.
I had been sure she would start cackling and guffawing,
 sneering at my childish, foolish, and shameful past.
But to the contrary, I could feel a sense of shock about her,
 ......something you could almost call disappointment.
".........What do you mean "is that all", ......I\'ve confessed everything inside me!
 What aren\'t you happy about?"
"The atonement for your sins is still insufficient."
"Atonement?
 ......What the hell, are you asking me to prostrate myself right here and apologize like Dad did...?!"
"............No.
 I have no interest in the home affairs of your immediate family.
 Where are we?
 Rokkenjima.
 The main residence of the Ushiromiya head family.
 ......Isn\'t there a sin you should remember, fitting for this place......?"
"............Are you......saying that I have...another sin......?"
"......Remember, Ushiromiya Battler.
 .........And it is your inability to remember which is your sin.
 For that reason, I shall forgive you.
 If you can remember, I shall forgive you.
 .........Remembering that is my test of atonement for you."
".........That\'s......a lot easier said than done......"
"............Remember.
 ......That is why it is a sin."
"...Sorry, Beato.
 ......I have absolutely no memory of it."
"......You make it seem like I caused you trouble six years ago or something,
 but unless I\'m mistaken, this family conference is the first time we met.
 It\'s true that your legend did exist six years ago,
 but I\'m pretty confident that we didn\'t know each other back then."
"......Naturally.
 On the Rokkenjima of six years ago, I was not yet manifested."
"Then what kind of sin are you saying I have?
 ......Are you saying......I\'ve sinned against you somehow...?"
"Do not make me repeat myself.
 I was not manifested six years ago.
 For us to have been acquainted would be an impossibility.
 In the world you represent, it was as though I did not even exist."
......Beato\'s cold eyes......felt as though they were accusing me of some kind of sin.
It felt, on the face of it, as though she was still holding a grudge for some way I\'d treated her, and was criticizing me for it.
However, ......I obviously couldn\'t remember doing anything like that to her, and Beato had said so herself.
There was no link between us six years ago.
{p:1:Six years ago, no person called {f:5:Beatrice} existed for me}.
".........At least give me a hint.
 ......Does this sin or whatever...have something to do with...
...you and me......?"
"I had no connection to you six years ago.
 Remove me from your thoughts already.
 ......Why...do you think it is a sin against {i:me}?"
".........Your......eyes."
"Eyes...?
 ............Hoh."
"Your eyes, they\'re......whispering at me to apologize.
 ......But I had no connection with you six years ago, and even you admitted that."
"............Is it true?
 ......Is it really not a problem between me and you......?"
".........I already said it wasn\'t.
 No problem between me and you has anything to do with this."
"But still, ......your eyes are telling me differently.
 ............So I don\'t even have a clue.
 .........Can you say it in red?
 Can you declare that the sin you\'re telling me to remember isn\'t something between you and me?"
"...........................
 ......Very well."
{p:1:The sin I am now demanding that you remember is not between Ushiromiya Battler and {f:5:Beatrice}}.
".........Then why are you looking at me with those eyes......?"
"I do not know.
 .........I am simply gazing at you blankly.
 If it feels that way to you,
 ......perhaps that is because there is something that makes you feel that way."
"........................
 .........What the hell kind of sin have I got?"
"{p:1:Ushiromiya Battler has a sin}."
"......I said what kind, dammit.
 It\'s probably just some stupid sin, like hitting someone or tricking someone."
"{p:1:Because of your sin, people die}."
"L‐liar...!
 I\'ve never killed anyone...!!
 Say it, then!
 Who did I kill?!
 When? Who? How?!"
"{p:1:Due to your sin, a great many humans on this island die}.
 {p:1:None will escape, all will die}."
"Wh‐.........whaaaaat?!?!
 Wh‐what the hell are you going on about?!
 Are you saying {i:I} killed everyone?!
 I\'m a killer?!"
"You do not carry it out directly.
 .........However, because you committed a sin, the cogs of fate were sent astray, spun a full six years, and due to the deviation that resulted,
 ......tonight, this many lives are lost."
"{i:You are one of the causes of this tragedy}."
"......Oh, ......come the fuck on!!
 {i:I\'m} the cause?!
 Then what?!
 Are you saying thirteen people died because {i:I} abandoned the Ushiromiya register six years ago?!
 Are you saying thirteen people died because {i:I} came back to the Ushiromiya family after six years?!"
"Give me a fucking break!!!
 For these six years, I\'ve been the man furthest from the Ushiromiya family!
 What influence could {i:I} have had on {i:anything} and how?!"
"It\'s not like I came to the family conference because I wanted to!
 I\'d patched things up with the family after six years, so to like, draw a line under that whole period,
 I came to Rokkenjima reluctantly...!!
 It\'s not like I had some duty to come here today!"
"I came back, and because of that a tragedy occurred?
 Then what?!
 You\'re saying that if I hadn\'t come back, no one would\'ve had to die?!"
"Say it in red!!
 Can you say in red that if I hadn\'t come back, this screwed‐up murder case wouldn\'t have occurred?!
 ......There\'s no way you can, because you\'re the culprit behind everything!!"
"Repetition requested!!
 "If Ushiromiya Battler hadn\'t returned to Rokkenjima, the crime wouldn\'t have occurred".
 Go on, say it if you think you can...!!"
"......Can\'t do it, can you?
 There\'s no way in hell you can, the culprit is you, not me!!
 Don\'t you dare try to push the blame for this onto meeeeeeee!!!"
"......................................."
"......Answer, in red!!
 I said repeat it...!!
 You can\'t!
 My existence has nothing to do with the crime.
 Stop messing with my heeeaaaad!!!"
I began to remember that the raindrops pounding down were cold.
......The rain earlier had just hurt,
 ......but now I felt a tormenting cold from those raindrops......
".................................
 ......Is there nothing that you remember?"
".........Sorry,
 but I don\'t have a goddamn clue."
".............................."
"......Look.
 ......I\'m starting to get a little pissed off.
 ......If there\'s something you wanna say, then say it.
 If you have a grudge against me, you just have to come out and say it.
 ......Don\'t be nasty about it and demand for me to remember."
"............I\'ll ask one more time.
 ......Can you not remember any sin?"
"No!!
 I can\'t remember a goddamn thing...!!"
".........So...
...he says that he can remember...nothing."
With this, are your regrets at an end......?
"...........................
 ...............m...m..."
Even a hopelessly long shot will be a source of regret if not attempted.
......That will do.
The attempt itself has meaning.
".........That may be true.
 ...In that case, this is...
the end of my regrets, and my game."
What will you do...?
"...Who knows.
 .........I\'m not interested at all anymore.
 ......Sorry, but I wish to leave the game board now."
..............................
 ......I see.
 ......I understand.
"I will take over for the rest of the game.
 .........You may rest."
"......Mm.
 ..............."
"All that remains, I will finish.
 .........You may forget everything and bury your head in your pillow.
 A feather futon should gently protect you from everything."
".........Finish up the rest for me, ......please."
"Leave it to me.
 ......Leave everything else to me, and sleep."
The witch who had questioned Battler hid herself,
 and the other witch, who had appeared from behind, remained.
She was certainly identical, the same witch,
 .........but her expression was somehow indifferent and ice‐cold,
 ......a far cry from the one before, who, though apparently drunk, had at least been in high spirits.
"...............Hey!!
 Are you listening?!
 That\'s enough for that test thing, right?!
 I don\'t give a crap whether I passed or failed!
 The only thing that\'s gonna help the way I\'m feeling is bashing you in the face!!
 Get the hell down here!!
 Or else open up this door...!!"
The witch said nothing back.
Her eyes were as ice‐cold as Battler\'s shoulders.
......She was clearly a different person from the one who had first appeared on that balcony.
The witch looked hard into my eyes, ......and gave two small shakes of the head.
Even without words, I was able to gather that she was expressing some kind of disappointment...
Without saying anything, the witch turned on her heels.
After that, only Battler remained, the cold rain still beating down on him.........
The study was in the middle of a lively party.
It seemed that Gaap was making fun of {f:5:Virgilia}, teasing her over some stupid triviality.
...They were spitting "Lialialia", "Gapgapgap" at each other.
Kinzo and Ronove had opened a new bottle and were enjoying the show.
"Oh, you\'re back.
 How were the results of Battler\'s test?!"
"Maria\'s test got passing marks with no complaints, I\'ll have you know?
 I\'ve long held her in contempt as a worthless little urchin,
 but lo and behold, surprise surprise, {nobr:my oh} {nobr:my oh} {nobr:my oh} my, not bad, not bad, not bad indeed!
 Wa‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah!!"
It seemed like Kinzo was dead drunk.
{n}He laughed towards Beato with the same level of excitation as the time they\'d left for the tests.
...However, Ronove and {f:5:Virgilia} instantly noticed the change in her enthusiasm.
Gaap also froze her expression and went silent.
"Wahhahahahahahhahha, what is it, {f:5:Beatrice}, my beloved witch?
 Not enough to drink? Not enough on the side?
 Let\'s go out in the pouring rain and roast a cow whole, oohhh, not a bad idea!"
"Ronove, make the preparations right away!
 {f:5:Beatrice}, let\'s leave the results of Battler\'s test for later.
 Why don\'t we have a toast with spare ribs first, uwa‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah!!"
"..................Roast yourself whole."
"‐ha‐hah‐hah‐hah,
 ......what?"
As Kinzo doubled over laughing in a great mood, the witch who had spoken bluntly passed him coldly by.
......Then, behind the witch\'s back,
 .........the old summoner\'s body suddenly went up in flames...
"Gyuoaaaaooaahhh!!!!
 Gwohh, gah, ......gyah.........w...h...y............?!"
While spitting crimson flames from his eyes, mouth, nose...every hole on his body, Kinzo rolled around.
......Even though it was a terrible hellfire, it didn\'t burn anything except Kinzo.
Kinzo didn\'t have a clue what was going on.
......He rolled around, unable to understand why {f:5:Beatrice}, who had been in such a good mood,
 had suddenly turned so cold......
The dancing silhouettes of witches and demons created by that massive rolling torch...
looked like a group of excited spectators around a burning at the stake.
However, the eyes of the demons watching over it were indifferent......
When Kinzo finally stopped moving, the fire disappeared, leaving a pitch‐black corpse.
The inside of the room was commanded by the stillness of the sound of the rain......
"......What has happened, Milady?"
"It has lost its thrill.
 .........Clean up those bothersome cinders."
{f:5:Beatrice}\'s expression......was unbelievably apathetic.
...There was an iciness there that told the others that they risked the same fate as Kinzo if they annoyed her.
"............Y‐yes.
 I will do it..."
Gaap made a jet‐black pitfall swallow up Kinzo\'s cinders.
...If she hadn\'t carried that out quickly, Gaap might also have been burned.
 You could feel that thirst for blood.
No, a thirst for blood probably isn\'t the best way to describe it.
......Just like humans don\'t have any particular emotion when they step on an ant while walking.
......That was how much, unconsciously and mercilessly, Beato was now filled with a brutal emptiness that wouldn\'t hesitate to bury a passerby...
"......Wh‐what is it, Beato?"
"I don\'t want to answer.
 ...............No, I can\'t even be bothered to answer any more."
".........What is it? This isn\'t like you.
 ......Did something happen?
 Did Battler say someth—"
".........k...g...gyhh—"
{f:5:Beatrice} hadn\'t even responded.
 It seemed that she had even ignored it.
But there was a change in Gaap.
From her feet, a crackling, cracking sound rose, like thin ice breaking,
 ......and in an instant, turned Gaap into a glass sculpture.
"G‐......Gaap..."
"............Disappear for a while.
 I\'m in a very bad mood."
{f:5:Beatrice} spoke in a truly cold voice,
 ......which froze the heart just to hear it.
"......Certainly.
 In that case, please allow us to retire.
 .........If you need anything, call at any time."
After a single bow, Ronove turned into a cloud of gold butterflies, and hid himself.
{f:5:Virgilia} turned Gaap from a sculpture into a group of gold butterflies,
 and then turned into a cloud of them herself, which mixed in with the others and disappeared.
............In the study made untidy by drinking,
 ......{f:5:Beatrice} stood still, alone.
Since the time she had returned, her expression hadn\'t changed in the slightest...
......However, when she saw the fallen empty wine bottles and scattered cheese plates,
 her brow furrowed, and she looked a bit displeased.
And when she whispered "disappear", in that instant, the room flashed, and was tidy again, as though nothing had ever happened.
The reception chairs were neatly arranged, and there was no wine or cheese.
{n}There were no stains where things had been spilled, nor was there any scattered trash.
......To the contrary, even the air had frozen over,
 and, enough to make one doubt whether so many noisy people really had been in this room until just moments ago,
 .........the study had returned to total silence.
.........In that silent, ......frigid study where even the air had frozen,
 {f:5:Beatrice} stood still...
Then, she called him in a mutter.
"..................Battler.
 Are you there?"
"......I\'ve been here for a while.
 .........What the hell\'s going on with you?
 You\'ve been acting strange."
"Do I seem strange?
 My apologies."
"............Even though you were having such a good time drinking with that damn old fart, you suddenly burned him up,
 and your demoness friend is a glass sculpture.
 ......Even your demon butler and your master got a "disappear and get the hell out".
 ......Just how fickle and selfish are you?"
"Battler. I\'m done."
"With what?"
"............I\'ve had enough, now."
"Wha?
 .........Well, uh, you were the one who cooked up this game.
 Heh, if you\'ve had enough, that\'s great for me.
 So basically, you\'re resigning?"
"I am not resigning.
 I am just ending it.
 No, I won\'t even end it.
 The game will simply be abandoned for all eternity."
"Pretty sure they call that resigning.
 ......Man, the words "got tired of it and threw it away" fit you perfectly."
"Precisely.
 I am tired of it and am throwing it away.
 I don\'t care about the rest.
 It can remain abandoned and gather dust as much as it likes."
"........................
 ......What\'s up with you?
 You\'ve been kinda hard to deal with since a short while ago."
"......Are you still sour over that baffling test?
 If you\'ve got something against me, all you have to do is say it clearly."
"You said in red that it has nothing to do with you, but that\'s got to be a play on words, right?
 It\'s written all over your face.
 You have a grudge against me."
"How many times will I have to say I have no grudge against you before you\'ll understand?
 At the time you left your sin behind, I did not exist."
As Beato spoke with an irritated expression, her face twisted to look even more displeased.
Fickle.
 Inconsistent.
 Moody.
 Temperamental.
 ......Selfish and simple‐minded and cruel.
But even so, she had never shown an expression as strange as this even once before now...
"............Well, you were the one who instigated this game.
 I\'m a bit let down that it won\'t get resolved, but feel free to invite me again sometime if you feel like it.
 But when that time comes, allow me to politely decline, alright?
 Heheheh."
He intentionally spoke in a teasing kind of tone, but Beato showed no reaction.
......Battler hung his head and clicked his tongue...
"I\'ve circled around October 4th and 5th over and over again, but it looks like I\'m finally going to be free of all that now.
 ......This way, the boat will come tomorrow."
"...That\'s right, then the seagulls will return to the harbor.
 ......I\'ll finally be able to hear Rokkenjima\'s signature "nyaa nyaa" cries.
 After all, when I came to the island, they weren\'t there at all, maybe because of the weather."
".........‘When the seagulls cry, everything will end’, basically.
 ......Done and done, all over, the end.
 Man, what a relief."
".........Exactly what is it that you\'re misunderstanding?"
"Hm?
 What do you mean what?"
".........I said that nothing would end.
 With this, everything will be abandoned.
 The game will be forgotten, and the pieces on the board will be left where they lie.
 There will be no advancing, no retreating, no taking or being taken.
 No victory, no defeat, not even a tie.
 Just abandoned."
"............Doesn\'t that mean it\'s over?"
"Wrong.
 On my turn, the game will stop for all eternity.
 Your turn will not come.
 So there will be no victory, nor defeat, nor a tie."
".........In the past, I could not allow you to do that to me.
 That was because I had the goal of victory against you.
 However, I have lost interest in that.
 So there is no longer any point in me making any further moves."
"............What do you mean by...my turn won\'t come...?"
I\'d thought that Beato getting tired of the game meant I\'d be released, and I\'d be able to escape Rokkenjima.
But for some reason, the meaning of Beato\'s repeated words about the difference between abandoning the game and settling it...
...was starting to bother me...
.........Just what has she been saying, ...and why the bad mood......?
Suddenly, I heard a voice from behind me.
When I turned around, ......there was someone I thought I might, or might not, remember from somewhere...
......A mysterious girl, with no light in her eyes, was standing there.
".........What she means is something like this.
 ......Putting the lid back on this game, leaving the pieces as they are.
 Without ending, the game will be locked away for all eternity."
"The only way for you to return to your original world is to win against Beato.
 .........So Beato abandoning the game would mean...
 ......Get it?"
Suddenly, in another place, there was a girl wearing a bright pink dress.
......I had a feeling I\'d met her somewhere too, but I couldn\'t remember.
More important was the meaning of the words she said.
{n}......The game being abandoned means......huh?
".........That\'s all there is to it.
 No match can reach its conclusion without two opposing sides.
 .........It means that you\'ll never be able to win and escape this world for all eternity."
"In the end, ......it\'s kinda like taking the key to the cage that you\'re locked in,
 fastening it to the collar of a pigeon or something and letting it fly, I guess."
"............This isn\'t funny, Beato.
 We didn\'t come all the way here to watch a boring game like this.
 Just wrapping it up here? You have to be kidding me."
".........I\'m with Lambda.
 I came here to make Battler win, and to make you thrash about in defeat.
 I still haven\'t achieved that goal.
 ......I couldn\'t bear for the game to be abandoned here, for you to just run away on me."
"I acknowledge that the way the curtain has fallen on this game has made for a disappointing end for you ladies.
 ......However, I, the host of this tea party, am after all fickle.
 Once the fun is gone, I know no way of entertaining.
 ......I believe that to be what makes me the witch I am in the first place.
 There should be no problems with this...?"
"..............................
 ......True.
 I won\'t go against your creed."
"I won\'t stand for this...
 ......Don\'t you dare, how much do you think I\'ve supported you...
 All that preparation, and you want me just to pack it all in now?
 I don\'t think so...!!"
"I am saying that I have tired of it.
 Nothing more, nothing less."
"That\'s not happening...
 You\'re going to continue this game.
 You want to win against Battler, right?
 You want to win and make him submit, right?!
 You\'re almost there!
 Isn\'t she~?!"
".........D‐don\'t turn to me for agreement.
 ......That said, I do have an opinion too.
 If you\'ll let me say it."
"............What."
"You brought this fight to my door.
 I\'m prepared to settle this fight one way or the other.
 ......I\'ve come close to surrendering many times,
 but I\'ve never had any intention of escaping part‐way through, leaving the match undecided."
"......As long as I\'m here, showing the will to fight,
 ......don\'t you go running away, {f:5:Beatrice}."
"............I agree.
 Getting Battler involved and then leaving without giving him victory or defeat is just beyond irresponsible."
Suddenly, even Gretel was there.
{n}......And everyone was criticizing Beato for being irresponsible.
"Hoh.
 .........It seems that the greatest reason I am being called irresponsible is that Battler will be stuck as an opponent."
".........In that case, Battler.
 Will you step down from being an opponent, as I shall?
 That way, there will be nothing to criticize me for."
"If I step down, will I be able to leave Rokkenjima...?"
"Of course not.
 Just be covered in dust and let it pile up on your shoulders."
".........Stop being so stupid.
 Just how irresponsible are you?
 You\'ve killed all this many people.
 On top of that, using your witch\'s power, you\'ve done it over and over.
 In gruesome ways!
 .........There\'s no way I can allow you to escape without taking responsibility...!"
"Responsibility.
 ......Hoh, what is it I should do to take this so‐called responsibility?"
"Fight until a resolution is reached.
 Battler will sit in the chair across from you, never giving up, and fighting until he beats you.
 So you too fight until you\'re defeated.
 If you don\'t want that to happen, then try and defeat him...!!"
"I won\'t let you...leave everything unresolved and abandon Battler in this chair,
 ......lock him up forevermore and never let him return...
 .........I won\'t let you......!!"
"......Gretel."
To be perfectly honest,
 I didn\'t really understand from what standpoint Gretel was trying to save me.
......But in her words,
 I could feel a strong determination to save me from this crazy game world no matter what.
So, I also responded to that.
"Beato.
 Face this way."
"....................."
"I am here.
 Across from you, in the rival\'s seat.
 ......Get it?
 As long as I continue to sit here,
 I won\'t permit you to escape.
 ......So don\'t run away. Fight."
"You started this fight, dammit.
 All the crap you\'ve pulled, again and again and again, the total shitshow you\'ve turned this whole thing into!
 And now after all this time you think I can let you end it because you\'re {i:tired} of it?!!"
"I am your opponent!!
 As long as I\'m here,
 there\'s no way I\'m letting you escape!!"
"Are you listening, you goddamn Witch of Irresponsibility?!
 Why don\'t you say some{-}thiii{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}ing!!!"
After I yelled at her, ......Beato went silent for a while.
Whether my words had reached her, or whether she was thinking about something completely different...I couldn\'t tell.
But for a while, she was silent,
 ......gazing at me with an expression I could read no emotion from,
 ......and when she realized that I noticed, she averted her gaze.
Then she turned her back to me, ......and said this...
"So you ladies say that......since Battler will not quit as my opponent, you cannot accept my abandonment of this game."
"............In that case, I shall ask...
whether the man over there was qualified to be my opponent in the first place."
".........Qualified?"
"...Probably has something to do with that test or whatever just now."
"...............What are you planning to do...?"
"...Y‐...you aren\'t gonna—"
"I will now question you to determine whether or not you are qualified to be my opponent."
".........Listen, now, Battler.
 If those qualifications are acknowledged, I will stay in my seat and continue the game.
 And I shall promise to fight for all eternity until the outcome is decided."
"Heh!
 I was ready for that from the beginning."
"............However,
 if you are not qualified,
 ......you will disappear.
 If the opponent disappears, there is no game.
 I can leave this place openly.
 .........Are you ladies satisfied?
 I will not permit interruptions."
"..............................
 ......Go ahead, do as you like."
"......B‐...Battler...
 You......make sure you answer well..."
"The very reason I\'m here is because I\'m qualified, right?
 Heh, there\'s nothing to be scared of...!"
".....................
 .........Y‐......you couldn\'t be......"
Gretel grew suddenly pale.
 ......I\'d thought her to be the calm, collected type, so her expression surprised me.
"......Well then, Battler.
 I shall have you repeat in red."
"Y‐you\'re giving me a repetition request?
 Heheh... Damn you, stealing my signature move.
 ...But can I do the red truth too?
 How...?"
"............Ju‐just will it to be so and you can do it.
 It\'s easy."
"{p:1:My name is Ushiromiya Battler}.
 ......Wh‐......whoa, pretty cool."
"Stop it!!
 I know what you\'re after...!!
 But don\'t do it!
 He\'s......!!"
When Gretel yelled, Beato glared at her.
{n}Then, her form was wiped away in an instant.
"Shut up.
 You leave your seat for a while.
 You too, ladies.
 If you are going to interfere, I will not hold back."
"...............We won\'t get in the way.
 Go ahead, do as you like."
"B‐Bern, this is bad!!
 She\'s trying to erase him, she\'s trying to erase Battler!!"
"......What......?
 What is it she\'s......scheming here......?"
"Well then, I shall question your qualifications.
 ............Interesting.
 Attack and defense are reversed from a normal game.
 This is a very precious experience, coming at the very, very end.
 .........Ready? First listen carefully.
 I will speak with the red first."
{p:1:I am the Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}}.
{p:1:And I opened this game in order to fight Ushiromiya Kinzo\'s grandchild, Ushiromiya Battler}.
"......I know that.
 So what?"
"Repetition requested.
 .........‘Ushiromiya Battler\'s mother is Ushiromiya Asumu’."
"Whaa?!
 ...Why\'s Mom\'s name popping up all of a sudden......?"
"I do not require chatter.
 Just repeat it in red."
Beato urged me with the same indifferent tone.
......But I don\'t have a clue what she\'s trying to do.
{n}......I\'ve done absolutely nothing wrong that I\'d hate to be confronted with, and there\'s nothing that I\'m hiding.
There\'s nothing she could demand for me to repeat that would cause me any trouble.
{n}......So, why something like this...?
"Sure, I\'ll repeat it.
 {p:1:Ushiromiya Battler\'s mother is Ushiromiya Asumu}.
 ......The red sure is convenient.
 No need to bother myself with bringing a copy of the family register."
"I do not require chatter.
 I will continue.
 "Your name is Ushiromiya Battler"."
"......Sure.
 {p:1:My name is Ushiromiya Battler}."
"It was from Ushiromiya Asumu that Ushiromiya Battler was born."
"{p:1:It was from Ushiromiya Asumu that Ushiromiya Battler was born}."
"It was from Ushiromiya Asumu that you were born."
"{p:1:It was from Ushiromiya}...
{m:-5:—}—...
...hhnguh...
...{nobr:{m:-5:——}—}?!
 {nobr:{m:-5:——}—}?!?!"
All of a sudden, my throat closed...
{n}I was suddenly assaulted by a shortness of breath that felt as if I had been choked.
Wh‐.........what\'s going on......?
 O‐......one more time......
"It was from Ushiromiya Asumu that I was born...
 ...Dammit...
 It was from Ushiromiya Asumu that I was born..."
"............Wh‐what the hell?
 Even though I was doing it so easily a second ago, I suddenly stopped being able to get the red to work...!"
"........................Do you decline to repeat it?"
"I\'m not declining...!!
 It\'s not working for some reason...!!
 It was from Ushiromiya Asumu that I was born...!!
 Why?!
 Dammit, why can\'t I use the red?!
 What the hell?!?!"
"..................tch..."
"..........................."
My Mom is Ushiromiya Asumu!
{n}Why can\'t I say that fact in red?!
{n}What\'s going on...?!
 Th‐this is......gghh—!!
"If you try to forcefully speak red that cannot be spoken, you will choke.
 There is no need to strain yourself.
 .........Allow me to use the aforementioned fact to press you in blue."
"......Do you remember?
 The blue is used to proclaim a theory for the opponent to deny.
 They are then burdened with the responsibility of denying that in red, and if they do not, then it is victory.
 .........Then let me begin."
{p:2:Due to the previous repetition request, and the refusal to repeat,}
 I proclaim that you are not qualified to be my opponent.
{p:2:After all,}
 {f:5:Beatrice} opened this game in order to fight with "Ushiromiya Kinzo\'s grandchild, Ushiromiya Battler".
{p:2:This gave you the responsibility, as my opponent,}
 to declare in red that you are "Ushiromiya Kinzo\'s grandchild, Ushiromiya Battler".
{p:2:You declined to repeat that}.
{p:2:This means the loss of your qualifications}.
"......D‐......deny something about that in red...
 ...Quickly!!"
"S‐sure...
 I,
 {p:1:I am Ushiromiya Battler}...!
 Given that I\'m able to repeat that in red, that should mean that I\'m your opponent!!"
"It may be a fact that you have the name Ushiromiya Battler.
 However...
 {p:2:People\'s names are not exclusive}.
 {p:2:It is possible for multiple humans to have the name Ushiromiya Battler}."
"
{p:2:What it comes down to is this}.
 ......{p:2:You are a different person with the same first and last names as Ushiromiya Asumu\'s son, Ushiromiya Battler}."
"Wh‐......what......?!!
 Don\'t be so stupiiiiiiiiid!!
 I\'m Mom\'s kid!!
 Ushiromiya Asumu\'s kid!!"
"
{p:1:It was from Ushiro}miya Asumu that...
—...
hkkhk—
......nn\'g\'g\'gkkhh......!!!
 ............*gasp*!"
"Shit!!
 Why?!
 Why can\'t I say that I was born from my mom?!
 How could something so stupid be true?!"
"No need to suffer.
 I will not toy with you.
 ......This is checkmate.
 {p:1:You are not Ushiromiya Asumu\'s son}."
...............Wha—...............
"You\'re.........
kidding......me..............."
"Who are you?
 What person calling themselves Ushiromiya Battler?"
"W‐...wait a second...
 ......I am...Ushiromiya Battler......
 It was from Ushiromiya Asumu that I was born, and I\'m Mom and Dad\'s son...!"
"No.
 There is no way that you are the Ushiromiya Battler with qualifications as my opponent.
 And as proof..."
"Proof?!"
"You do not know of that sin six years ago."
".........Uh,
 .........th‐that\'s............"
"No, if you were the true Ushiromiya Battler, you would not commit a sin.
 But consequently, a sin did occur, a span of six years became a blank space,
 and a man who knew nothing of that time appeared on Rokkenjima calling himself Ushiromiya Battler.
 ............The truth of it all...goes like this."
Six years ago, ......the true Ushiromiya Battler, qualified to be my opponent, was already dead.
You were involved in a plot by Rudolf having something to do with distribution of the inheritance...
a body double set up in Ushiromiya Battler\'s place.
"I, ......I\'ve never heard anything so stupid.........
 .........That\'s......just......absurd............"
"......B‐Battler......!
 Get ahold of yourself...!!"
"...........................Well.
 ...If he can\'t counter back, there\'s nothing more to do.
 ...Battler did not possess the qualifications.
 That\'s how it is."
"A‐are you okay with that, Bern?!
 If you accept that, you\'ll lose too, you know?!"
"Uh, and you\'ll win.
 ......Why are you taking Battler\'s side......?"
"Mgh, ............mghhh..."
"How disappointing, Battler.
 .........It really is disappointing that you didn\'t have the qualifications to be {f:5:Beatrice}\'s opponent.
 I was careless myself.
 I can\'t believe I bet on an unqualified piece.
 ............You\'ve defeated me utterly, {f:5:Beatrice}."
"......There is no victory or defeat.
 The opponent will simply disappear.
 Perhaps I should say that he was never there in the first place."
"But then......who.........am I......?
 Am I......not Mom and Dad\'s kid......?!"
"Who am I...... What am I......?
 ............If I\'m not Mom\'s kid, ......then what, are you saying I\'m some total stranger\'s kid with no relation to them at all?!"
"If that is the case, it would mean that you do not share Kinzo\'s blood.
 Either way, you are not qualified to compete in this game."
"...............Absurd.........
.........absurd..............."
"Enough.
 ......I was slightly aware that you might not be Ushiromiya Battler in the first place.
 ......So, I had to question you.
 I had to ask about something the real Battler would have known."
"............What a shame.
 I even bet on the one in a quadrillion chance of a miracle,
 that you might really be Ushiromiya Battler.
 However, it looks like you\'re a different person with the same first and last names after all."
"............kh.........uuunghhh............"
Bit by bit, Battler\'s form......began to be clouded in darkness...
No, maybe it was the other way around.
 ......The whole world was becoming clouded in darkness, leaving only Battler behind...
Battler was down on all fours, hanging his head and repeatedly questioning himself.
......However, he would never be given an answer......
In the world stained with darkness, Beato spoke something, and {f:5:Lambdadelta} ran up to Battler yelling something very quickly,
 but it already seemed very far away, and it didn\'t reach his ears...
............Then he,
 .........not knowing who "he" was,
 ............erased...
himself............
"BATTLEEEEEEEEEEER......!! ......nn...gh........."
"Now the opponent has disappeared.
 ......Well then, if you would excuse me.
 And ladies, you should prepare for your journey.
 No more festivities are prepared for in my territory.
 It was good seeing you.
 ......Goodbye."
Without saying anything more,
 Beato clouded her own form in darkness as well, and disappeared......
"A‐.........are you......alright with this?!
 Battler......d‐disappeared, you know?!
 Someone who hates losing as much as you do is okay with this?!"
"..................Weren\'t you betting on my defeat?
 Then you should be over the moon.
 Congrats, Lambda.
 Well then, let\'s meet again in some other world, okay?"
"That said, there are endless fragment worlds out there.
 The probability of us having some connection again somewhere is probably truly less than one in a quadrillion.
 ............Alright, it was fun.
 Bye‐bye."
"Ah, ...wait up, Bern...!!!"
Chasing after {f:5:Bernkastel}, who had disappeared first, {f:5:Lambdadelta} disappeared as well...
Then, after everyone had disappeared, .........there was no one left in the study.
It returned to silence, almost as though no one had been there from the beginning.
{n}......No one was here in the first place.
The silent study told of that wordlessly, and the sound of the wind and rain began to fill the room bit by bit......
In a world where everything had sunk into darkness, Beato questioned herself.
"......The fact is............from the very beginning, magic should only have been used within Mariage Sorcière."
"............Yes.
 ...I thought that too,
 ......when Ange happened."
"The witches\' alliance began with you and me.
 Just two people.
 ......Mixing in other people was the first mistake..."
".........It was just so much fun.
 ...That\'s why we wanted to add other people close to us into that circle.
 And in that way, we wished for the witches\' alliance to grow forever larger,
 so everyone could have fun using magic together, and all become happy."
"But.........in the end, you and I were the only ones able to understand magic."
"We\'re......the only two witches in this world, brought together by a miracle.
 .........As long as I have you, Beato, I don\'t need anyone else anymore."
"............Nor I.
 As long as you are here, I no longer need anyone else."
"In the very first moment that Mariage Sorcière was formed,
 ......it was already complete."
"...............That is...so.
 That is truly so......"
It was a witches\' alliance to make everyone happy together, with magic.
{n}......I wonder when it got this screwed up?
What was I trying to do when I started this game?
{n}......I can\'t really remember even that.
No, I may remember,
 ...but that\'s a feeling I now wish to throw away to the far side of oblivion.
".........It\'s alright.
 Let\'s just forget everything, okay?
 Our little two‐person Mariage Sorcière.
 ......We\'ll accept each other.
 And no one will be able to hurt us.
 So we won\'t be hurt anymore. We won\'t cry."
"Let\'s forget everything.
 ............Okay, Beato?
 ......We...are eternal......"
"..............................Maria......
 ............uuuuuuuu, .........uuuuuuuuuuuuu...!!"
