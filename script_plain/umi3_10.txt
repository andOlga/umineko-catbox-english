The true enemy of holding a fort probably isn\'t the fear of unseen enemies.
 It\'s whether you can keep it going over a long period of time.
Maria had gotten bored and had started making a ruckus because she wanted to watch TV.
 Since there was no TV in the lobby, she decided to return to the cousins\' room upstairs.
The adults probably didn\'t want to leave Maria all on her own, among other reasons.
 They told all the children to go to the cousins\' room upstairs.
George, his heart wounded by the loss of his fiancée, had no willpower to resist that, and led the cousins upstairs.
At first, Nanjo had been reading a book in the lobby,
 but when he noticed that the relatives looked like they wanted to talk about something shady,
 he said "It seems I am in the way..." and returned to his room upstairs.
".........I\'m starving.
 And if I keep just sitting around, my drowsiness will be even worse."
"It\'s only natural.
 Because we didn\'t sleep last night."
"...We will probably end up barricaded here for a full 24 hours.
 It may be wiser to take naps in turn instead of over‐stressing ourselves."
"I agree.
 My husband and I will be here, so anyone who finds this difficult should rest without overdoing it."
"They might be expecting that, you know?
 They may not be able to defeat this many people, but if that number was reduced by a certain amount, they may plan to use that to their advantage."
"There are seven of us here.
 Two of us could rest for three hours at a time.
 ......It\'s a long time until tomorrow morning.
 We still have some energy now, but tonight\'s going to be tough."
"Sure will be.
 Anyone sleepy?
 Don\'t overdo it, rest."
Hideyoshi looked around at everyone to see who wanted to sleep first, but no one volunteered.
...Everyone was just as tired, but no one was bold enough to be able to sleep now.
 ......Their fear of the unknown culprit was just as strong as their sleepiness.
"......Nobody?
 Well, don\'t overdo it, everyone."
"If we get tired, we can think about it then.
 ......I certainly am tired, but I\'m not in the mood now."
Eva spoke sharply, and then read once more over the second letter from {f:5:Beatrice}, which had been found in the boiler room.
{f:5:Beatrice} had sent them two letters, and had repeatedly told them to solve the riddle of the epitaph.
And she had even provoked them by saying she would give up the inheritance, both assets and headship, if it could be solved...
Eva took out a notebook and opened it to a page with the epitaph copied onto it.
"............Is that the epitaph?"
"Yes.
 ......Although it\'s annoying to do as the culprit says,
 after all, we do have time to waste.
 I think it\'s the perfect way to stave off boredom."
"...Not a bad way to kill time.
 Why don\'t we challenge it together as siblings?"
"......Can I borrow that?
 I\'ll rewrite it just a little larger.
 Natsuhi‐san, do you have a slightly larger piece of paper?"
"There should be paper in the servant room.
 I will bring some."
Natsuhi immediately brought a B4 blank sheet of paper from the servant room.
Kyrie borrowed Eva\'s notebook, wrote out the epitaph on the paper, and laid it out on the table.
Straight away, everyone peered down at it.
...A fence of people naturally formed.
"I\'ve heard about it, but...
...really, this is a tough riddle.
 I don\'t have a clue what it\'s talking about."
"At one point, I also did my best to challenge it, but I was just as clueless."
"If we did know, we wouldn\'t have come all the way out here with a plan to make money.
 After all, it\'s ten tons of gold."
"............This is the first time I\'ve read it seriously, but...
...roughly speaking, couldn\'t it be split into three parts?"
"...I\'ve been thinking this since last night, but you really do seem to be a good thinker, Kyrie‐san.
 It\'s possible that you could easily solve this riddle that we couldn\'t."
"Yeah.
 Kyrie\'s sharp.
 ......She might be able to tackle it in an interesting way if we don\'t give her any strange preconceptions."
".........Yes.
 Kyrie‐san.
 Will you let us hear your honest thoughts having read the epitaph?"
"I think it probably won\'t be very useful to all of you.
 You all give me too much credit."
"No way, anything that comes to mind would be helpful.
 Let us hear what you have to say.
 ......Because your hints always help me when I\'m worried."
"Oh, so they were helpful?
 It\'s nice to finally hear about this now."
"Come ooon, don\'t I always thank you?"
"You two do get along well.
 I\'m jealous."
"And the rest of us would also love to accept your hints.
 It\'s alright, we\'re just killing time anyway, so why not relax?"
Kyrie was bewildered by all this praise she was suddenly receiving.
...But they had plenty of time.
 She realized that this was just a way to waste time, and she decided to accept that role...
"......I\'m sure I\'ll say something off the mark, but...
well, I\'ll put forward my ideas."
"Mmhm.
 ......What did you mean in the beginning, about how, roughly speaking, it could be divided into three parts?"
"Well...I just mean what I said.
 I think that overall, the epitaph can be divided into three parts."
"First, there are the five lines up to and including "There the {loghint:kagi:key} to the {loghint:ougon:gold} sleeps".
 Up until this point is the first part, which points to the location of the key."
"And then there\'s the part formed by the eleven lines up until the tenth twilight, which refer to the location of the {loghint:ougonkyou:Golden Land} itself."
"And the remaining six lines make up the part after the Golden Land has been reached."
"I see.
 The key, the Golden Land,
 and the Golden Land\'s {loghint:takara:treasure}; it can be divided into these three parts."
"Even we have been able to grasp that much.
 The three sections that refer to the key, the door, and the treasure."
"...Nii‐san, don\'t butt in any more than you have to!
 Let Kyrie‐san speak her ideas freely."
"Kyrie.
 Please continue.
 ......We recognize the same thing regarding what you said.
 So then?"
"......I wonder what that thing in the beginning, the "{loghint:natsukashiki:beloved} {loghint:kokyou:home of old}", means.
 Thinking about it normally, would it refer to Grandfather\'s home?"
"Since he explicitly mentioned that it\'s {loghint:natsukashiki:beloved}, I can imagine that it\'s a home he thought about very deeply.
 ......Didn\'t Father come from Odawara?"
".........Odawara is definitely where he was born,
 but I don\'t think this home Father loved was Odawara.
 I believe all of us siblings are thinking of the same place."
"...Yes.
 This probably isn\'t Odawara.
 From what I\'ve heard, he had a very fun time as a youth."
"Hahhaha.
 ...Dad\'s greatest misfortune in his life was probably being made the Ushiromiya family head."
"......Probably.
 Father really hadn\'t wanted to become the Ushiromiya family head."
"So where is it?
 And is there a {loghint:kawa:river} where {loghint:ayu:sweetfish} swim?"
"......Maybe there was at the time.
 I\'m sure that there has been a lot of development there by now, so the sweetfish might have disappeared.
 It would be extremely difficult to investigate whether there were sweetfish there during the time Grandfather was a boy."
"There\'s not just one river, either.
 I believe we all investigated thoroughly in a geographical sense.
 ......You even went to the actual place to investigate directly, didn\'t you, Eva?"
"That was only as a vacation.
 ......But the townscape had changed completely from Father\'s time.
 After all, there was a war in between.
 It was impossible to even figure out where Father actually lived.
 ...Probably, even if Father dragged himself to the actual location,
 by now, even he wouldn\'t be able to determine where it was that he lived."
"They\'ve had a remarkable revival over there, after all..."
"............Doesn\'t any place name come clearly to mind after hearing "{loghint:ayu no kawa:sweetfish river}"?"
"Not really.
 I mean, they\'re sweetfish, right?
 People say they live in rivers with {loghint:kirei:clean} {loghint:mizu:water}, so there are countless rivers we could guess at.
 Any {loghint:ogawa:stream} that Dad innocently went {loghint:ayuzuri:sweetfish‐fishing} in was probably buried by the development later.
 It would be different if we had a map from before the war, or a person who knew a lot about how the area was before the war, but..."
"......It probably isn\'t something like that."
"What do you mean...?"
".........Behold the sweetfish river, running through my beloved home of old.
 You who seek the Golden Land, follow its path downstream in search of the key.
 ...After these two lines, there is a single blank line."
"...Something is being presented with just these two lines.
 I would suppose the next three lines continue based upon that something."
"I wonder what it is that\'s being presented, then...?"
"......I don\'t know.
 In any case, after just these two lines, it\'s not something vague like you don\'t know which river it is...
you\'re able to narrow it down and say specifically what "{loghint:kawa:river}"."
"......It may be that this isn\'t a "river" with water flowing down it.
 ...The "sweetfish river" might be some kind of metaphor.
 ......What kind of image does the word sweetfish have?"
".........Sweetfish are like {loghint:shake:salmon}.
 They\'re {loghint:tansui‐gyo:freshwater fish}, but they go out into the {loghint:umi:ocean} right after they\'re born.
 And when they get big, they return to the river to live there,
 and then they {loghint:sanran:spawn} there and end their lives there."
"Well, they leave their home at one point, but the part about them getting big and returning there to lay {loghint:tamago:eggs},
 that might have a family prosperity type of image."
"Huh.
 They\'re freshwater fish, but they can live in the {loghint:kaisui:ocean}?
 I didn\'t know that.
 I thought they were {loghint:kawa‐zakana:river fish}, so they couldn\'t go out into the sea."
"And they are also called {ruby:kougyo:香魚} (aroma fish) because they have a pleasant smell.
 I have never eaten one, but I have heard that they are very delicious when {loghint:shioyaki:grilled with salt}."
"Whoa, Natsuhi‐san!
 You\'ve never eaten salt‐grilled sweetfish?!
 They\'re delicious!
 I\'ll treat you sometime!"
"It is a food for commoners.
 It isn\'t appropriate for your mouth."
"......This is just my wild idea,
 ...but the image I get from a sweetfish river has made me suspect a {loghint:kakeizu:family tree} before.
 The sweetfish go out into the ocean for a time, but they return to the river where they were born to spawn, right?
 .........It makes me think about myself."
"......You\'re right.
 I can confess now...
that I have sometimes suspected that it refers to you and Maria‐chan."
"I see.
 ......As you travel down it, you will see a village.
 The only "village" ({ruby:sato:里}) you\'ll find by going down the family tree is the one in Maria\'s name (真里亞)."
"Right?!
 ......But as you all know, Father has a dislike of Maria,
 and he has almost never spoken with her."
"Besides which, Father once told me to give Maria a completely different name.
 I just made it Maria on my own.
 Father was very mad about that."
"......If you think about the history there,
 I just really couldn\'t imagine that he\'d reference Maria\'s name in his precious epitaph about who would inherit his wealth and the family headship."
"Have you ever let Maria‐chan read the epitaph?"
"Um, yes. Of course I have.
 But she didn\'t seem to have a clue.
 ......She didn\'t have a clue, and she kept going on about that same occult stuff, about how it was a {loghint:fukkatsu:resurrection} {loghint:gishiki:ceremony} for the witch."
"............A connection between Father and Maria.
 ...Certainly, they do share that occult hobby, but they never interacted.
 ...I can\'t imagine it refers to Maria either."
"......What interests me is the fact that he explicitly added the word "{loghint:natsukashiki:beloved}" at the beginning.
 ......Like you all said just now,
 if Father was reluctant about becoming the Ushiromiya family head,
 would he describe it that way?
 ...I don\'t think it is Odawara, which points back to the Ushiromiya {loghint:honke:main family}."
"......I believe that this word "beloved" here at the beginning...
definitely refers to a place full of very important memories to Father."
"...............Hmmmmmm.
 ...Well, that\'s fine.
 It\'d be hard to pinpoint since we don\'t have a clue about a map from that time,
 but anyway, there were probably several rivers with sweetfish swimming in them near Dad\'s home during his youth."
"That\'s if it\'s a river with water flowing down it, right?
 And then?
 Go on, Kyrie‐san."
"......I don\'t really understand the three lines starting with "As you travel down it, you will see a village".
 ...These are probably coupled with the two lines about the sweetfish river."
"It\'s probably something that we would automatically understand if we knew what the sweetfish river really was.
 ...As long as we don\'t understand that, it\'s probably useless to try and solve those three lines any further."
"So we\'re screwed unless we know what the "sweetfish river" really is...
 And there\'s no guarantee it even means a literal river."
"...Seriously.
 The heck does it mean by sweetfish?
 Were they a {loghint:koubutsu:favorite dish} of Dad\'s?
 Or is there some special meaning?
 Is it pointless to read too deeply into it?"
"...If you don\'t have both a micro and a macro perspective, your field of vision grows narrow.
 ......Think not too deeply, about a river with {loghint:sakana:fish} swimming in it, or some kind of {loghint:nagare:flow},
 ...something you can {loghint:kudaru:go down} or {loghint:noboru:go up},
 keep those kinds of abstract images in mind, and we may be able to come up with more out‐of‐the‐box ideas."
"And via the three lines that follow, the answer for the "sweetfish river" ends up at the "key to the Golden Land"..."
"If you think about it this way, I wonder if it was a mistake to split it into three parts.
 There\'s actually four parts.
 ......‘Go down the sweetfish river’,
 "find the key to the Golden Land",
 "journey to the Golden Land",
 and "the treasure of the Golden Land"."
"Hmmm... ......Truly interesting.
 While we have this opportunity,
 would you mind continuing and telling us your opinion about the most central portion of the {loghint:hibun:epitaph},
 up until the {loghint:dai‐juu no ban:tenth twilight} where we arrive at the Golden Land?"
"......That\'s the most symbolic, ...and also the most disturbing part."
"Since it keeps mentioning the word {loghint:ikenie:sacrifice},
 I can\'t help but think it has something to do with Father\'s occult {loghint:gishiki:rituals}...
 .........How do you see it, Kyrie‐san?"
Kyrie recrossed her arms several times,
 peering into the paper with the epitaph copied onto it as though she was looking through it...
"...........................
 .........This is...very difficult.
 ...By starting with "You who laid {loghint:te:hand} upon the key",
 it probably means that you won\'t be able to continue without understanding the key.
 ...I\'ll have to give up, but I\'ll take a shot at it anyway."
"......Just like how the "sweetfish river" isn\'t necessarily a river with water flowing down it,
 it is also doubtful whether this "key" is actually something shaped like a key."
"Right.
 There\'s also the possibility that it\'s a code or a keyword.
 ......After all, this key isn\'t something to be stuck into a keyhole.
 It\'s something that selects the six people to be sacrifices for the first twilight."
"In that sense, we can state that this key isn\'t something to open the door to the Golden Land."
"......But what a disturbing key.
 A key that can select six people to be sacrifices..."
"How would a key {loghint:erabu:select} anything?
 ...Does it spin around like a roulette...?"
"This key points towards a certain specific group of {loghint:roku‐nin:six people}.
 ......No, we should say it points to a certain specific group of {loghint:muttsu:six things}.
 ......If this doesn\'t mean a literal command to offer sacrifices.
 ...For example, it could be an anagram."
"An anagram?
 Do you mean a word game...?"
"Yes.
 Ever since Rosa started talking about the family tree and how "village" was a part of Maria‐chan\'s name,
 this has constantly been going through my mind."
"......It seems as though Rudolf‐san, for example, has run with the words "beloved home of old",
 and is assuming that it has to something to do with {loghint:chikei:geography} or {loghint:zahyou:coordinates}, but that might not be true.
 This could be some kind of puzzle, ...or maybe playing with letters."
"......I\'m sorry.
 What do you mean by playing with letters?"
"Oh yeah, it\'s like "sucker merry barrellers".
 What do you get when you take out the e\'s and r\'s?
 Like that.
 Well, you were raised well, Natsuhi‐san, so you probably haven\'t heard that one."
"Take out the e\'s and r\'s? Huh?
 ???"
"Don\'t.
 It is an undignified game, inappropriate for you."
Only Natsuhi didn\'t get it and had a blank look on her face.
It seemed that she had only guessed the answer had to be something undignified,
 after hearing Rudolf and Eva\'s snickers.
"Ah, ...Natsuhi nee‐san, it\'s something like this.
 There was something like it in Maria\'s book of puzzles, okay?
 There\'s this thing called the Tanuki Notebook."
"There\'s a notebook written in some kind of code, with a lot of "ta"s mixed in,
 and if you "{ruby:nuki:remove}" all of the "ta"s, then the true sentences pop up.
 It\'s a game like that."
"Ah......oh, I see.
 .........??"
Natsuhi finally realized the answer to the undignified riddle Rudolf had posed, and her face grew red as she hung her head in embarrassment.
"...............So maybe that "remove" part is actually represented by "{loghint:korosu:kill}"...?"
"Yes.
 I was just thinking that too.
 It\'s possible that the key to the Golden Land is a word with {loghint:roku‐moji:six characters}."
"In other words, ...the "ta" from the Tanuki Notebook...is actually six characters here...?
 Hmmm, ...this is gettin\' complicated..."
"Playing with letters, is it...
 ......Hmmm.
 In Japan, it really feels like a child\'s game, but it seems that it is a stylish form of humor among intellectuals in the English‐speaking world.
 ...It is easy to imagine that Father showed interest in it."
"......But right here, I quickly lose my ability to understand it.
 Up until this point, while it was filled with mystery, it was extremely sequential."
"‘Sweetfish river’, "go down it", "then find the key" is all extremely sequential.
 And we can guess that we gain a six‐character key as a result,
 ......but in that case, we now don\'t know {i:what} we kill the six characters from."
"That\'s a point.
 What do we subtract the six characters from?
 It doesn\'t tell us."
"...On the second twilight, it says "{loghint:nokosareshi mono wa:those who remain}".
 ......Which means that, at the very least, that "something" has a finite number of characters.
 You could read it like it\'s telling you to continue with the {loghint:nokotta:remaining} characters after the six characters are removed."
".........And yet, we don\'t know what this "something" is, even though it should have been shown to us at the beginning.
 ...Were we wrong even to assume that this is playing with letters...?"
".....................hmmmmm..."
Everyone crossed their arms and fell into silence.
It felt like they were about to reach a novel understanding that they hadn\'t been able to before...but they stumbled just one step before it.
At that time, Hideyoshi\'s stomach rumbled heartily.
The silence up until then was broken by laughter.
"Sorry, sorry.
 By spinnin\' the gears in my head for a change, my stomach\'s gone completely empty.
 Looks like skippin\' breakfast really takes its toll on me...wahahahahaha."
"Natsuhi.
 Is there nothing here?"
"There should at least be enough set aside for breakfast.
 I will prepare it."
"I\'m also starving.
 I\'ll bet those brats above us are starving too.
 ...But I doubt there\'s enough for 18 people here, and for three meals."
"You\'re right there.
 It\'ll be a marathon to tomorrow.
 It might be better if we took a trip back to the mansion and fished around for some canned food or something in the kitchen."
"There\'s nothing more than crackers and snacks, but if that is alright, I can prepare them.
 But with this many people, there might not be any left for lunch..."
"That will be fine for now.
 Sorry, but would you prepare it for us?"
It looked like the men had been taken over with an appetite that stopped all thought.
The atmosphere grew more peaceful, and the epitaph investigation meeting broke up for the time being.
But Eva kept staring at the paper the epitaph was written on like she was going to burn a hole through it...
"............A word game was nothing more than my theory.
 There is a chance that it\'s mistaken.
 Eva‐san, don\'t take it too seriously, okay...?"
".........Thank you.
 This is something I\'ve decided to do myself.
 Would you mind leaving me alone?"
Eva spoke coldly.
...Kyrie didn\'t bother her any more, and went to help Natsuhi prepare breakfast.
"Nee‐san.
 Shouldn\'t we also help prepare breakfast?"
"Then you go help.
 I\'m busy solving this!"
"S‐sorry...
 Th‐then I\'ll go help..."
".........Come {i:on}.
 Why are you like this?"
"......Huh?"
"The Ushiromiya family inheritance will be given to the person who solves this epitaph.
 You seem to have given up from the beginning, as though it has nothing to do with you,
 but if you could solve it, even you have the opportunity to inherit the family headship."
"......This is a chance to steal everything from Nii‐san.
 Why aren\'t you seriously trying to solve it for that once‐in‐a‐lifetime chance?"
"...Um, .........umm, ......I......"
Rosa hung her head, troubled over how she should answer.
...She regretted, for the first time in a while, carelessly speaking to her sister when she was in a bad mood.
"If you\'ve noticed anything, say so.
 Even though Kyrie‐san and I were seriously reasoning, you just kept nodding your head, didn\'t you?
 Come on.
 Isn\'t there anything you\'ve noticed?
 Come on!"
".........Uh,
 .........umm,
 .........
 ......Isn\'t...this strange?"
"...Strange?
 What is?"
"Umm, ......this word, {loghint:ougonkyou:Golden Land}.
 The word Golden Land comes up several times."
"So what?
 Do you get some keywords by splitting up the characters in "Golden Land"?"
"Um, umm, that\'s not it.
 ......Look, isn\'t just the tenth twilight strange?"
"...............Huh?
 ......ah."
"Even though they\'re all written the "Golden Land" ({ruby:ougonkyou:黄金郷}), for some reason, this one place has the "Home of the Gold" ({ruby:ougon no sato:黄金の郷}).
 He explicitly mixed in the character {ruby:no:の}, changing the phrasing.
 It vaguely bugged me that it\'s only said differently here..."
".........ah, umm, ...it\'s not like it means anything.
 This is Father we\'re talking about.
 It could just be a coincidental change in how he said the word."
".........................................."
".........Boring."
"Oh? What is boring...?"
".........Boring, boring."
"Well now.
 I don\'t have the foggiest idea what this child is grumbling about."
"She is probably dissatisfied that you gave Battler‐sama various hints, Madam."
"......Noooope?
 I\'m not dissatisfied about that.
 I\'m actually {i:more} satisfied now that that worthless Battler has finally reached the level where he can go along with me."
"Hoh‐hoh‐ho...
 Was I a little too friendly with Battler‐kun?
 Maybe it would be better if the old people went away and left everything to the young kids."
"Pu ku ku ku ku..."
When {f:5:Virgilia} and Ronove giggled and cackled,
 {f:5:Beatrice}\'s irritation meter finally reached its limit.
"Ahhhh, the both of you joining forces and laughing at me!
 Ronove, hide yourself for a while!
 Go away, go awaaaay!"
"Certainly.
 Then, I will rest for a while.
 Pukkukukuku..."
Ronove bowed his head, still laughing, and hid himself.
After that, all that remained was the figure of {f:5:Beatrice}, who was grumpy and irritated,
 and {f:5:Virgilia}, who was coolly enjoying her tea.
"...............When you said "
There are no more than 18 people on this island}", you actually cornered yourself."
".........I thought so...
 ............I thought it might have been a {i:little} too early, but...
 ......I guess it really was......"
"If you had led him further astray beforehand, things might have been different,
 but it really was a futile trump card.
 You stirred him up instead."
In addition to his victory condition of denying the witch,
 Battler had held onto a different victory condition, since he had wanted to explain things without suspecting any of the 18.
Hadn\'t he been at his weakest when he was being tossed about by these two opposing goals?
However, {f:5:Beatrice} had used the red carelessly, and had proclaimed that there were no more than 18 people.
...Because of that, Battler had been forced to suspect one of the 18,
 .........and he had finally begun to build up the readiness that he needed to accept that.
Battler was stubborn,
 but because of that, when he was struck where he was fragile, fissures would crack all over him, like breaking china.
That itself should have been his greatest weak point...
".........Kuuuuuu.
 ......Maybe I got a bit too careless after my overwhelming victory last time......"
"Yes, you were too careless.
 ...The last game was a difficult one for Battler‐kun,
 but it seems...
this game will prove a difficult one {i:for you}."
"......A broken vase will definitely never return to its original form.
 ...So it would be more constructive to think of the next move, rather than regretfully picking up the pieces."
".........But now that Battler has all the right ideas in his head, how should I plot against him...?"
"Hoh‐hoh‐ho.
 Your troubled face is an even better treat than Ronove\'s cookies."
"......Uu.
 You and Battler and even Ronove keep treating me like a snack.
 ...Even though I\'m not sweet at allll."
With a shameful, childlike face that she would never have shown in front of Battler,
 {f:5:Beatrice} rolled her head around on top of the table.
"............Masteeer.
 .........At least a hiiint."
"Oh?
 What kind of hint?"
"If you know a skillful move that will make Battler speechless, and make him want to accept me,
 I won\'t ask you to say it outright, so, umm,
 ...even if it\'s just a hint..."
"Hoh‐hoh‐ho, I can\'t.
 I am acting as Battler‐kun\'s ally right now,
 so I cannot teach you something that would give you an advantage."
"...You don\'t have to be so strict...
 Your disciple\'s in troubllle..."
"I believe you harshly boasted that you had surpassed your master, correct?"
".........Uu...
 Please act like the old person you are and give me just a bit of your cunning wisdom...
 Pleease...
 It\'s mean if you only help Battleeer..."
"My, my.
 You\'re still a spoiled child."
"......But, it\'s true that I may have given Battler‐kun a few too many hints.
 It did serve as a scolding to you,
 but perhaps it was a little too much support for a fair game."
"You see, you see...?
 Please, Masteeer, at least just a hint to help me on..."
"..................Just a hint.
 Think about what it means by yourself, alright?"
"Yeah, yeah!
 I\'ll think about it myself, so please!
 Please, give me one that\'ll leave Battler down in the dumps, Masterrrr."
It was truly shameful how she behaved when Battler wasn\'t around, even though she acted utterly like a Great Witch in front of him.
{f:5:Virgilia} sighed, lamenting under her breath that Beato never seemed to grow up.
"Then just a hint.
 ......Do you know of Aesop\'s fable, The North Wind and the Sun?"
"Of course.
 It\'s a story about how the north wind and the sun challenge each other to steal the cloak of a traveler, right?"
"That\'s right.
 The moral is that violent or impatient methods aren\'t always necessarily the best decisions."
"......You don\'t have to tell me that.
 I have already reflected on the fact that I rushed too fast towards victory."
"...............
 Think well about what this means.
 And furthermore,
 ......although it seems that Battler‐kun had a slight misunderstanding as well, you too seem to be under a misapprehension.
 Do you understand the victory conditions of this game?"
"...What else is there, other than making Battler submit to me?"
".........See?
 At that point, you are already mistaken."
"How am I mistaken?"
"Your victory isn\'t making Battler‐kun submit.
 ......It is to get Battler‐kun to accept your existence, is it not?"
"......What\'s this?
 You want me to butter up Battler, and ask him to "Accept me as a witch, pleease?"!
 How foolish!
 I will not sink so low!"
Grrrrrrrrrrr..., Beato growled, like a dog in a bad mood.
{f:5:Virgilia} shrugged her shoulders, snickering at her disciple, who was as short‐tempered as always...
"That is my hint.
 Now you should think deeply.
 .........In any event, your moves up until now will not work on Battler‐kun.
 A significant tactical conversion will probably be required."
"...I know that even without you telling me.
 ......I don\'t have a clue what you mean by the North Wind and the Sun,
 but anyway, I understand that I will have to change my direction.
 ......I\'ll showcase a clever scheme that will surprise even you, Master...!"
"Hoh‐hoh‐ho...
 I look forward to it.
 I wonder how Battler‐kun will tackle that.
 ......I will be wishing you good luck as well."
"After Battler, right?
 Hmph..."
".........Are you going to give up and resign already?
 If you\'re that tired, why not just go into a futon and sleep forever...?"
...As my consciousness grew vague and I pretended to fight my drowsiness, sinking deeper and deeper into the sofa,
 "I" scolded "myself".
"......Don\'t you remember how much you dreamed about stealing the position of family head from Krauss...?"
"Even though I gave you that chance with my magic, you\'re already throwing it away...?"
You say that, but...
 ............This riddle is really difficult.
Even a wire puzzle would be better.
...At least in that case, you\'re assured that it definitely is solvable.
But with this epitaph riddle, I don\'t know if I\'m even assured that.
......I might just be fighting a useless battle.
...Still hazy, I looked at the notebook which I had been holding the whole time.
It was opened to the page with the epitaph, which I had stared at, almost burned a hole through, on so many hundreds of nights I had lost count.
......That...is truly a door.
On the other side...is the "Golden Land", that place which ever since I was a child I\'ve wished to reach, I\'ve spared no effort to reach,
 ...and I\'ve never been able to reach.
Here I am with both hands upon the door,
 ...and even though the book, no, the door is open, I still cannot reach the other side?
"...That\'s right.
 You already have your hands upon the door.
 Come, open it with all of your strength.
 And read the characters written on the door."
".........Open it...
with all my strength.
 ...Read the characters...
written on the door..."
Strain your eyes.
 ......See through to what lies further beyond the epitaph written in the notebook...
"...The "beloved home of old" definitely won\'t betray our expectations.
 ......The only past that Father held dear was his years as a boy."
That\'s right......
 Then what about the "sweetfish river"?
There are several rivers where they swim, and it\'s dubious whether there was one very near the place that Father lived.
...If we start wondering which river that\'s home to sweetfish is closest in a cartographical sense...
things will quickly get vague and we won\'t be able to pin it down...
"......Didn\'t you say it yourself?
 You said it didn\'t have to be a river with water flowing down it.
 ......If the word sweetfish is too complicated, why not forget it forever...?"
"Think of a river.
 A river.
 Linking it with a "family tree" wasn\'t a bad idea.
 Try thinking about how to link a river with something else along those lines......"
......Not a river?
 Even though the sweetfish can\'t swim in it if it isn\'t a river?
Oh, but maybe "sweetfish can swim in it" means it joins up with the ocean......
My husband did say that, despite being river fish, they go out into the ocean... ...............
.......................................
 ...............With the ocean.
........................No,
 ...but,
 .........
 ......Huh...?
"......Did you notice?
 But that\'s just a faint memory.
 There should be a book archive somewhere around here.
 If you investigate, you can make sure."
......If that\'s the "sweetfish river".........
 .........And if the key might be a six‐character word...
.....................Is the key really resting in that river?
I, I don\'t know, I don\'t know.
...Anyway, I have to search in an atlas...
But, even if I know that, I don\'t know {i:from what} I should take the six characters...
"......You really don\'t know?
 Think deeply.
 .........We\'re too smart for our own good, so our thoughts are inflexible."
"Don\'t think of it like it\'s something as grandiose as "The Riddle of the Epitaph", but like it\'s a child\'s puzzle.
 ......Men are always children, no matter how old they get.
 Even if Father has advanced into old age,
 that doesn\'t change the fact that he is essentially a child inside his heart."
".........Throw away your awe of Father.
 ...Think of this like it\'s a worthless, infantile puzzle game, like the ones Maria suddenly brings up on the boat."
......Puzzles.
 ......Worthless, infantile.
........................
 .....................Huh, .........ah.
.........I\'m sure that was, ...what was it, ......umm, umm......
...I\'m sure, if my memory isn\'t wrong, ......that was probably, umm...
No, I don\'t have to rely on my vague memory.
I should be able to figure that out immediately too by searching in the archive.
".........We\'ve probably already realized the answer.
 ...All that\'s left is to research whether that\'s correct or not."
"Come, Eva.
 Let\'s go to the archive and make sure no one notices.
 ......There, we should find a mountain of thick books that didn\'t fit in Father\'s study.
 ...I\'m sure that we\'ll find a book that answers our question.
 .........Quickly.
 This is our first and last chance in our life to have our dreams made true."
When Natsuhi tried to lay a blanket over her, Eva suddenly jumped up.
"...I\'m sorry.
 I seem to have woken you."
"......Eva.
 If you\'re sleepy, don\'t overdo it.
 You rest first."
"Th‐......thank you.
 I\'m just going to the lavatory for a bit to wash my face."
"You should take it easy and rest.
 ...Your health\'ll take another bad turn, you know?"
"I said I\'m fine, really!
 I\'ll be right back."
Leaving only those words behind, I left the lobby at a brisk pace.
The lobby was partitioned off by a door, so as soon as I went into the corridor, they could no longer see me.
......The archive was next to the servant room.
Father always owned a vast book collection,
 but after he started to become engrossed with his occult hobby, his library of those kinds of books grew even larger,
 so that the normal books suitable for a normal study had been forced out as his study overflowed.
This archive was where those normal books were stored.
They were all stiff books for intellectuals, like complete volume sets of encyclopedias,
 but that was very convenient for me now that I was investigating something.
I entered softly, ......and just in case, I checked the room with my gun readied, making sure that there were no suspicious people there.
Then I locked it from the inside.
I actually wasn\'t thinking that the murderer might be hiding somewhere.
...What scared me was my fear that one of the siblings might hear what I was investigating.
My heart had started jumping......
...I had been half‐asleep until a short time ago, so I hadn\'t been able to realize how significant this thing I had realized was.
But as I started to become aware, ......my heart started feeling like it was about to explode.
".........I...wonder if any of the other siblings have realized this......"
I don\'t think Krauss and Rudolf will realize.
......But I don\'t know about Kyrie.
She has extraordinarily good intuition.
.........And I don\'t know about Rosa either.
"Rosa is as dim as the others.
 She always has been, and ridiculously so."
Really...?
 I think she was wise enough to make you think she was dim, so that she didn\'t earn herself unnecessary malice.
".........Here it is.
 ...I wonder if we\'ll find it in this one."
I pulled the book out, and flipped through the pages......
"...............Oh.
 .........This is...
......
a "sweetfish river"...?"
I see...
This is what the sweetfish river means.
......Don\'t dawdle around, research further.
"Y‐yes, I know...
 As you travel down it, you will see a village ({ruby:sato:里})...
 {ruby:sato:里} is an older word for {loghint:machi:town} or {loghint:mura:village}, right?
 But it\'s a densely populated area... There\'s any number of those..."
Why have you stopped thinking?!
If you don\'t like it, why not quit forever...?
Why not just hand over the Ushiromiya headship to Kyrie forever?!
"I, ...I don\'t want to...
 I will become the head.
 ...This is my first and last chance to do that...
 ......What is {i:village}?
 What does it mean?!
 Is there a village if you go down this "river"......?!
 ............ah, .........
aaaaaaaahhh......!!"
......In {loghint:sono sato:that village}, look for the {loghint:kishi:shore} {loghint:futari:the two} {loghint:kuchi:speak} of.
......It\'s a "shore" ({ruby:kishi:岸}).
 Understand?
"Uh, ...*gulp*...
 I, I, I understand...!
 Shore, ......shore.........!"
All those pieces that I hadn\'t been able to understand at all were...
...right before my eyes, starting to...
...snap,
 snap into place, all by themselves......
I couldn\'t even remember to close my open mouth.
...My throat grew completely dry...
Is it......really alright for this to be the answer?
R‐really?
 Really...?!
"...But this isn\'t six characters at all.
 ......I\'m absolutely sure that this is the answer, but this doesn\'t reach six characters at all...!"
Did you stop thinking again?
 In that case, think of a way you could read it with six characters.
If you can\'t think of one, then research it.
......There has to be an answer.
 You must not doubt that.
If you can\'t believe that, why don\'t you cry yourself to sleep, and then just give up and die forever...?
"............One,
 two,
 three,
 four,
 five,
 six...
 ......Oooh,
 ...s‐
......
six characters...
"
"......I,
 ......I found it.
 ...This is...
......the Golden Land\'s...
k‐
......key.........!!"
Yes.
 That is...the key to the Golden Land.
 ......The key...to our childhood dreams.
......The only keyhole to stick that key in...is that place.
That...is definitely what offers the sacrifices.
You get it now...right...............?
"Uuu, ............uuuuUUUgghhHAAaaaaa...!!!"
