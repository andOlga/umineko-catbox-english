It was the largest banquet hall in this huge hotel.
The many guests that filled the room chattered and applauded the person receiving an award trophy on top of the stage.
The sign in front said "Biggs Publishing Company Awards Ceremony".
"And now, I would like to begin the novel category.
 The winner...is a novel everyone here will be very familiar with.
 The story that started a worldwide movement,
 that continues to grow in leaps and bounds, the fantasy adventure novel...
‘Sakutarou\'s Great Adventure’!"
The projector in front of the audience showed a brief summary of the series.
It was...a lengthy fantasy adventure novel that was already more than eight installments long.
The thrilling fantasy story told of the adventures of Sakutarou, a cowardly vegeta‐lion who makes friends, learns through his experiences,
 and grows in his search for the One Fragment.
The main character\'s catch phrase, "I\'ll become the King of the Beasts", was even one of the candidates for the Best Phrase to Come Into Modern Slang Award.
In addition to being a thrill to read, the books also contained many messages for children to learn from,
 earning it high praise as an adventure novel that parents and kids could enjoy reading together.
However, it hadn\'t received praise like this from the beginning.
For the first six volumes, it went almost entirely unnoticed,
 but last year, when foreign translations of the series began, it got its big break and suddenly became a huge topic of conversation.
Even before this series, the author had created quite a lot of works,
 but none of those had achieved any public acclaim.
However, after this sudden rise in notoriety, her previous works were being reevaluated one after another.
It\'s probably fair to say that recognition of her works was very late in coming.
"Miss Kotobuki...!!
 Congratulations on your award!"
"Your latest, "Sakutarou and the Witch\'s Island", was truly an excellent read!"
Publishing company executives repeatedly showered her with praise.
"Sakutarou\'s Great Adventure".
{n}The author\'s name...was Kotobuki Yukari ({p:0:寿ゆかり}).
Nearly all of her royalties were sent to a fund to support needy children,
 and she herself served as the director at several protective institutions.
Some envious people tried to call this "fake charity", but the more that people learned about her, the more those voices withered and died away.
Kotobuki Yukari.
By now, that name rang loud and clear across Japan.
She sat in a chair, cheerfully chatting with the people who came to greet her.
Last year, it was discovered that she had developed a small tumor, and after the surgery, her physical strength had dropped sharply.
Because of this, even in this stand‐up awards party, she was given a chair and sat down while greeting people.
Some people lamented, saying that if only she had been twenty or even ten years younger,
 ......she might have left her mark in history as one of the greatest authors in the twenty‐first century.
It had taken so long for her to receive the praise she deserved......
She could no longer be called young.
{n}Even so, her determination to write had not wavered in the slightest.
The story had gone around that, even during her stay in the hospital, most of her time had been spent typing away.
She always said the same thing.
{n}That she hadn\'t finished telling everything she needed to tell.
Did she mean that she hadn\'t fully completed "Sakutarou\'s Great Adventure"?
This is how she answered when this question was asked by a journalist...
If, by writing even one more book, I can teach just one more child how to find happiness...
Then I will spend the rest of my life to write every book, every page that I can.
Because I still haven\'t fully conveyed the precious teachings I was given......
"Miss Kotobuki, congratulations on your award!
 I hear the movie adaptation has been getting splendid reviews as well!
 From what I hear, you\'re set to break records with the best‐selling books of the year!"
"Thank you very much for your kind words.
 It\'s more than I deserve......"
"Oh, I forgot to tell you...!
 My name is Eks, head of Company X\'s first editorial department."
"It is an honor to meet you...
 I hope we have a chance to work together sometime..."
"......Actually, Miss Kotobuki.
 ......I, uh, apologize for being abrupt,
 ......but do you happen to know of...
the mystery writer called Hachijo Tohya?"
"Hachijo......Tohya...... ......What about her?"
She recalled that name for the first time in several decades.
{n}She hadn\'t expected to ever hear it again.
"So you do know of Hachijo?
 I don\'t suppose you\'ve ever met...?"
"No, I have not...
 I did go to visit once, but I was an unknown back then.
 And, since I suddenly barged into the publishing company office, it\'s hardly surprising that I was refused an interview......"
"Oh, I didn\'t know that...!
 Could it be that you were a fan of Hachijo\'s work...?"
"No.
 I just wanted to find out what sort of person Hachijo was......"
"I see, I see.
 .......Well, the truth is...about that novelist... ......Hachijo Tohya would like to meet with you discreetly."
"........................
 ......To meet with...me?"
"Yes.
 It would not be a formal interview or anything, just a personal meeting, off the record......
 If you are interested, we would be delighted to make the arrangements...
 Oh, and of course!
 This has nothing to do with work!"
.........Hachijo Tohya...wants to meet...Kotobuki Yukari.
Just like I realized that Itouikukuro was Hachijo Tohya,
 ......did she use my name to figure out my identity?
The Rokkenjima mystery, which was sometimes called the greatest social phenomenon at the turn of the century.
That uproar, which dragged in enthusiasts from across the world,
 had suddenly subsided after an event held by Hachijo Tohya, where she was going to "unveil Ushiromiya Eva\'s diary containing the truth".
Though she had set up the event herself, she then outrageously disappeared without releasing the contents of the diary, drawing harsh criticism for doing so.
However, at the same time, this event resurrected a very, very natural feeling within the public:
 that all of this was prying into a terrible accident with many victims only for the sake of curiosity.
And so, the frenzy surrounding the Rokkenjima mystery faded away quietly...
Hachijo Tohya.
 No, Itouikukuro.
She caught the public eye as a Forger of Rokkenjima mysteries.
She claimed to have reached the truth, and released groundbreaking works of fiction one after another.
 She became famous as the driving force behind the Rokkenjima mystery.
After realizing that Itouikukuro was Hachijo Tohya, I went to her publishing company to ask for an interview, but I didn\'t get one.
At the time, I despised her.
Back in the beginning, I thought she might have used the Rokkenjima mystery as a publicity stunt to advance herself,
 .........but now I feel a bit grateful to her.
If she hadn\'t refused to show the diary in such an outrageous way,
 the Rokkenjima cat box might still be the plaything of countless goats.
She is indeed a Forger who toyed with the cat box, and I still have an uneasy feeling about her.
However, at the same time, she is the one who, practically speaking, allowed Rokkenjima to rest in peace.
And......did she really reach the truth or not?
How is it that she reached something that {i:even from my perspective} was infinitely close to the truth?
Even now, all these years later,
 .........that\'s something I\'d love to know......if it\'s possible to find out.
"What do you think, Miss Kotobuki......?
 Of course, this is not an urgent request.
 I was told to tell you to take your time in making your decision if you wished..."
"I understand.
 ......Does Hachijo Tohya live near the city?"
"I was told that a meeting near here would be satisfactory at any time...!"
"I see.
 ......In that case, can I ask you to arrange a meeting for us in a quiet coffee shop next Sunday...?"
"Yes, as you wish...!
 Thank you, thank you very much!
 I believe Hachijo will be delighted as well...!"
"I have one condition."
"Yes, whatever you say...!"
"I am not going to discuss business, so please refrain from sending anyone from the editing department."
"But of course! We will do as you say."
"Madam Hachijo and I will meet alone, just the two of us.
 Can I count on you to keep that promise...?"
"Well, as to that.........
 ......We would, umm, appreciate it if you kept this quiet, but..."
"What is it...?"
"......Well, the truth is...
 ......The works of Hachijo Tohya are written by two people.
 To the outside world, those books were written by a single female author,
 .......but there is actually a second author, a man...
 ......The pair of them asked for a chance to meet you......"
As soon as I heard that,
 ......I felt a premonition.
......How had Hachijo Tohya, a person with no connections to the Ushiromiya family, managed to write about their private circumstances in such detail?
I already felt a premonition of a certain kind of miracle......
When I left on my journey, I abandoned the name of Ushiromiya Ange and stepped into a new life.
By now, things had settled down, but back when the Sumadera family was still a threat, I wanted to distance myself from that name.
......Thanks to that, no one was able to get in touch with the new "me" anymore.
However, this year, "Sakutarou\'s Great Adventure" had caught the public eye.
 It had made the name of Kotobuki Yukari famous, ......and maybe that name had finally reached his ears.
I used to play with a lion stuffed animal called Sakutarou, along with Maria onee‐chan.
If those who knew this connected the name Sakutarou with the hint in my own name, ......then it\'s only natural that they\'d figure out who I was.
The number of people who could recognize me from this was very, very limited.
.........This person was also well‐versed in detective novels, and a man.
I could only think of one person who matched.
After all, I had learned just how many detective novels he had kept piled up in his room......when going through his personal effects.
It was almost the time we had arranged for our meeting.
My heart was racing, ......almost like a girl in love for the first time......
At precisely the arranged time, I heard the sound of the chime on the door,
 .........and {i:they} appeared.
It was a man sitting on a wheelchair...and a woman pushing him.
My eyes immediately fixed on the man in the wheelchair.
......And, right away, ......I saw the similarity in his face...
He was, unmistakably,
 ...............my brother.
My brother, ......Ushiromiya Battler......
When our eyes met, he gave a little bow.
 I hurried to my feet and bowed back.
......It was a somewhat exaggerated and silly way for a pair of siblings to greet each other after several decades apart.
......But the miracle I had waited for all these years had become a reality, ......and my mind was now completely blank.
"......Are you Kotobuki Yukari?"
"Yes, I am...
 ......And you two must be...Hachijo Tohya."
"A pleasure to meet you.
 Thank you very much for letting us borrow your precious time today.
 ......My name is Hachijo Ikuko.
 I am mostly in charge of the actual writing.
 ......This is Tohya.
 He mostly handles the drafting."
Though the woman who called herself Ikuko was far older than me, she seemed to be unbelievably youthful.
It wasn\'t because she was good with makeup or dressed like a younger woman.
It feels strange to say it...
There was a strange mystique about her, ......as though she was immortal and never‐aging.
Then, I quickly remembered that she had introduced my brother as Tohya.
"......Pardon me for asking, ......but are you two married?"
"We are not married, but we have been together for a long time."
"True. Looking back on it, it really has been a long time......"
My brother smiled as he spoke.
......When I learned that, at least for him, these long decades hadn\'t been a period of isolation and loneliness,
 I felt an incredible sense of peace and relief.
I suddenly realized that he was staring into my face just as I had been staring into his.
After all, when he saw me last, I was just six years old.
 It must be hard for him to find any traces he can recognize.
However, ......I\'m sure he\'ll recognize something, just the same.
We kept stealing glances at each other and looking away, like a couple on a blind date.
We were both at an age where outside appearances mattered to us.
 Even though we both knew, we couldn\'t let our polite exterior falter.
This humorous exchange was extremely embarrassing.
......I thought that when fate reunited two people like this, they would hold each other and sob tears of gratitude together.
However, it seemed that the reality of it was different......
But that\'s fine.
It feels like my heart will explode with happiness......
"Let\'s take our orders.
 Is coffee okay?
 What does everyone want?"
"I\'d prefer something that isn\'t so bitter.
 ......How about you, Miss Kotobuki?"
"Oh, ......I don\'t mind...
 ...I guess I\'ll have café au lait......"
How stiff we\'re being.
Even my brother seemed to be finding it amusing by now.
".........Well, then."
When she said that, my brother and I fell silent and sat up straight.
"Should I start the conversation?
 Or would you like to be the one to do it, Tohya?"
".........I\'ll do it.
 I\'m the one who pushed so hard for this meeting, after all."
As he spoke, he watched me calmly.
"I came here today......thinking that you might be a certain person.
 Her name is Ushiromiya Ange.
 ......When I read your works and heard your name, I was sure that you were her."
"That\'s right.
 ......How long it\'s been since I last used that name.
 My true name is Ushiromiya Ange......"
I gave the exaggerated bow that I\'d gotten so used to these long years.
......We\'ve both aged, haven\'t we, Onii‐chan?
I whispered this in my heart.
Now, it was my turn.
With a quick apology, I fished around in my handbag and took out a photo.
It was a picture from a trip I\'d taken to an amusement park with Battler onii‐chan.
I had many other pictures of us having a good time, but this one had the best shot of his face.
I looked between him and the photo.
{n}There was no longer any room for doubt.
"......Mr. Tohya.
 Your true name is..........Ushiromiya Battler......san, is it not......?"
The hands of the clock inside me stopped.
I wanted him to answer with a yes...
Even though I was already so sure, ......I was still about to burst with the tension.
And then, when that instant that seemed far too long ended, my brother answered.
"That\'s right."
".............................."
Unconsciously, I stared at my brother\'s face.
With unbelievable quickness, he\'d acknowledged that he was Ushiromiya Battler.
......My eyes immediately filled and overflowed with tears...
I took out a handkerchief and wiped them away, but I couldn\'t hold them back...
Onii‐chan was alive after all...
So why didn\'t he come back to me right away?
If he had been there during my darkest days, how much it would have meant to me......
Normally, the thought would have made me curse my brother, but by now, even that emotion was softened.
Because, now that I was faced with the miracle of being reunited with Onii‐chan, ......everything I felt before now fell away with my tears.
At this moment, ......I was happy.
I wasn\'t all alone.
{n}That belief had kept me going for decades.
And, finally, .........I had been rewarded......
By now, I couldn\'t even stop my tears.
For some time, I continued to sob and sniffle...
Watching this, my brother hung his head apologetically.
......Why hadn\'t he come back to me sooner?
{n}It looked as though he was feeling regret for that.
But I was sure he must have had some sort of reason.
He had probably come here today to tell me about it and apologize.
Already, ......just by him introducing himself to me today, ......everything inside of me had been washed clean with tears.
"......I\'m......sorry......
 ......I must be......embarrassing you......"
"No.
 It\'s only to be expected.
 ......For several decades, you\'ve been waiting all alone, believing that your family would return."
"I did believe......
 .........I believed you would come home.........
 .........Onii‐chan............"
I held out my hand weakly, ......and my brother slowly held his out too.
Then, ......I gripped his hand.
Regardless of how many long years had passed, .........it was, without a doubt, my brother\'s hand.
Once more, I had to struggle to hold back the tears......
"......Aunt Eva avoided the explosion accident by escaping to Kuwadorian.
 ......How did you escape the accident, Onii‐cha—......nii‐san?"
"On that day, ......I escaped through the underground passage."
"The one that goes to Kuwadorian?"
"I was told that an underground passage led to a hidden mansion on the opposite side of the island.
 ......However, the place we escaped to was a submarine base, not Kuwadorian."
I don\'t know under what circumstances my brother entered the underground passage on that day.
At any rate, he went into the underground passage, split up with Aunt Eva there, and escaped to the submarine base.
There, he escaped the explosion...and survived......
"From there, I got away on a motorboat.
 ......However, ......it must have capsized somewhere along the way."
"It...must have...?"
"......Please forgive him.
 Tohya suffers from memory loss.
 His memory from around the time he was drowning in the ocean is hazy."
"Could it be......that he forgot he was Ushiromiya Battler for a while...?"
"That is correct."
......Yes, that explains nearly all of the riddles.
My brother escaped from the explosion, but either his boat capsized during his escape from the island, or he fell overboard.
Afterwards, he must have drifted somewhere, wandered about half‐conscious, and maybe got into a traffic accident...
"On that day, he was lying on the road."
"If she had found me even a little later, I probably wouldn\'t have opened my eyes again."
"I believe you suspected that I was the one who hit you for quite some time."
"Hey, I\'ve already apologized for that......"
This explains pretty much everything.
Either because of the time he nearly drowned, or because of the traffic accident, my brother\'s memory was damaged.
His memory must have come back eventually.
However, by that time, I had already set foot into my new life as Kotobuki Yukari.
Only a handful of people, including President Okonogi, knew where I was.
Even if my brother tried to contact me, there was a very good chance that he wouldn\'t be able to.
.........Ironically, the name I had abandoned when I decided to live in the future...
had delayed my reunion with my brother for so long.
In that sense, I am responsible.
 I did it to myself.
......However, I think I did receive the message that my brother sent me.
It was through Itouikukuro.
I realized that Itouikukuro, the Forger who claimed to have reached the truth, was actually Hachijo Tohya.
And I did request a meeting with her through the publishing company, to question her about why she was so sure she\'d reached the truth.
However, I wasn\'t granted a meeting.
In the end, I heard nothing from them, and it\'s taken all these decades for me to meet Hachijo Tohya.
......If the publishing company had only passed my message on, we could have been reunited so much sooner.
However, at the time, I was just a bourgeois girl who liked to throw money around.
Why would they pass on my message when I just barged in with no introduction and demanded to meet the famous and popular Hachijo Tohya?
We probably crossed paths several times.
If just one of those had worked out, if we had been able to meet...
{n}......Just how much would my life have changed?
But this was fate.
God had decided that a few decades were needed before this sibling reunion.
And during that time, my brother became one half of a mystery novelist.
 I became a writer of adventure novels for children.
You could say that we achieved success in society.
My brother and I were able to be reunited after becoming successful.
Now, I could do nothing but thank God for bringing about this miracle...
"Maybe it was God\'s will that we should be reunited after achieving success as novelists...
 .........Back then, I was nameless, so I never got through to you.
 We\'ve met now because we\'ve both become famous as authors...
 ......I think all of this was God\'s will......"
"We did hear through the publishing company at the time that you wanted to have an interview with us.
 .........They told us that a fan who had discovered Itouikukuro\'s true identity wanted to talk, and they asked us for a decision."
"......You must\'ve had dozens of fans dying for an interview.
 You couldn\'t possibly go to meet all of them..."
"No.
 They let us know that your name was Ushiromiya Ange.
 ......At the time, I had already realized that Tohya\'s true name was Ushiromiya Battler, so I thought you should be given a chance to meet him."
"I...refused."
Those were my brother\'s words.
".........What.........did you say......?"
"I refused......because I didn\'t want to meet you."
Once more, my brother spoke clearly.
I was completely confused.
I could only sit there in shock and silence, waiting for the words that were sure to follow...
"......I believe I already mentioned that Tohya suffered from memory loss.
 ......And then, one day—"
"Why did you refuse, when you knew it was me...?"
I cut through Ikuko\'s words and questioned him directly.
What reason could my brother have for rejecting me?
{n}I couldn\'t think of anything.
That unpleasant feeling brought up long‐forgotten feelings of anger inside me...
"You must have known that your little sister was living all alone, being crushed by loneliness.
 So why...... Why did you refuse to allow me to see you...?"
My brother hung his head.
It seemed more like he was lost for words than apologetic.
Unable to sense that he even felt any compunction about his actions, I questioned him again in an even louder voice.
When I asked for an appointment with Hachijo Tohya, Itouikukuro was already famous as a Forger.
Why did Itouikukuro\'s Forgeries reach the truth?
It\'s obvious.
My brother, Ushiromiya Battler, explained to her what happened on the island in detail.
So, the appearance of Itouikukuro proves that my brother\'s memory had returned.
Therefore, he can\'t excuse himself by saying that he didn\'t remember me.
In fact, no, ...he isn\'t trying to make excuses.
On the contrary, he\'s openly saying that he refused to meet me, even though he knew who I was.
".........Looking back, ...I regret what I did."
"You {i:regret} it...?!!
 Did you ever try thinking about how I felt?!
 For decades, ......for most of my life...!
 Do you realize what feelings I had to live with......?"
Various emotions swirled inside of me.
{n}I realized that I wasn\'t in control of them anymore.
I could only moan, to prevent myself from saying something I\'d regret...
"I feel deeply ashamed for doing something so cruel to you.
 ......That\'s why I\'ve searched for you ever since then.
 For your sake and for mine, ......I should have met you much earlier..."
".........Then why.........wouldn\'t you meet me then.........?"
"......Miss Kotobuki.
 ......As I said before, ......his memory has been damaged.
 It was an aftereffect of the accident."
"But his memory came back, didn\'t it......?!"
"......Yes, his memory came back.
 However, that did not remove the aftereffects of the damage."
"I have Ushiromiya Battler\'s memories.
 ......However, I can\'t think of those......can\'t accept those......as my own."
"............Can\'t think of those.........as your own......?"
"......Yes.
 ......It\'s true that my memory of my escape from the island is still hazy.
 However, I\'ve remembered almost everything else."
".........Things like how those pink hair ornaments of yours that you treasured so much...were something I won for you at the game corner in that amusement park."
"Yes, that\'s right.
 They\'re a treasure from when I was a child.
 ......I still keep them with me in my handbag..."
"I remember a lot more besides that.
 ......I remember you giving Mother trouble because you hated eating seaweed.
 I remember that you tried to move it to my plate and trick her.
 ......And when—"
"If you remember that much, .........then why can\'t you think of those memories as your own...?"
"...............That is......the condition I live with.
 ......I\'ve been to several hospitals, but it didn\'t do any good.
 ......You probably can\'t understand it.
 You can\'t know how painful it is to have your mind suddenly fill with the memories of a man you don\'t know..."
It was a terrifying feeling of losing his own identity.
The memories of a stranger filled his head, and they threatened to crush and overwhelm him.
They were almost certainly his own lost memories.
However, .........his brain couldn\'t accept them as his own.
"Those days were painful, terrifying.
 .........It felt like my mind was being invaded...
 ............On any given night, after I turned off the lights and went to sleep, maybe "I" would never wake up again.
 Maybe a different man would wake up the following morning and start living life in my body.
 ......I can\'t count the nights that I spent tormented by this fear..."
".........He tried several times to convince himself that they were his real memories.
 ......He told himself that he was Ushiromiya Battler over and over again."
"But...nothing worked.
 ......I am me, ...Hachijo Tohya.
 ......No matter how much Ushiromiya Battler\'s memories flow into my mind.
 ......To me, they\'re the memories of another person.
 .........I couldn\'t accept Ushiromiya Battler........."
......As "Ushiromiya Battler" said this, ......he hung his head as his eyes turned red.
"............And one day, out of the anguish of being torn between himself and the other self he couldn\'t accept, in a fit, he............"
".........................................."
"He was fortunate enough to survive the ordeal, but the injuries he sustained then forced him to spend his life in a wheelchair..."
".........How......terrible......"
Now I see why he appeared in that wheelchair.
And, ......now I know why he refused to meet with me......
He was afraid......of me calling him "big brother".
He was terrified of meeting me, fearful that the part of himself that wasn\'t him would grow still further in his mind.
"Even so, he fought.
 .........He felt that, since Ushiromiya Battler was inside him, it was his responsibility to meet you.
 Thinking that, ......he kept on fighting in the space between his two selves."
And then, .........in a fit, he............
......After something like that, it was only natural that Ikuko would tell him that he didn\'t need to remember Ushiromiya Battler anymore.
Bit by bit, he tried to forget that he was once "Ushiromiya Battler".
Doctor\'s instructions and medication.
 With that and Ikuko\'s diligent care, ......he slowly began to regain his peace of mind......
"Even so,
 .........I...
thought that I would have to meet you sooner or later.
 ......To be honest, I didn\'t get a wink of sleep last night.
 .........I was...terrified of meeting you......"
"............................................."
"If I met you, would I die?
 ......I was afraid that I would.
 ......However, here I am, talking to you normally."
"......That\'s why I regret what I did.
 .........If only.........I could have............met with you earlier......
 ......You......and the Ushiromiya Battler inside of me.........might not have had to suffer for all those years...
 ......Just thinking that makes me feel so......sorry.................. ............"
As the man who was once Ushiromiya Battler said this, he broke down crying.
......I was already......beginning to understand.
It really......{i:was} true.
{n}Ushiromiya Battler............did die that day.
After all, .........didn\'t the witches say that he was dead so often with the red truth...?
.........How pathetic for the Witch of the Future......the Witch of Resurrection......who swore that everyone would be together always......
..........................................
"......Tohya‐san.
 Please, raise your head."
"............M‐......Miss Kotobuki......"
They realized why I had called him Tohya‐san.
And by calling {i:this man} by that name, ......I myself felt the agitation in my heart subside a little.
"Thank you.
 .........You must have suffered a lot.
 ......Thank you so much, Mr. Tohya......"
"......Uugh.........uuuuuughhhgh..............uuuu......"
".........Thank you,
 nii‐san.
 .........Thanks......for pushing yourself so hard to come here today............"
Holding hands, ......we brought our foreheads close and cried together for a while.
Then, we talked of the old days.
He remembered many things vividly, even things that I couldn\'t remember myself.
Each time, they made me cry even harder, and he hung his head apologetically.
And once I realized that my tears were hurting him, I just did my best to let him speak, nodding along with a strange look on my face, something between a sob and a smile.
.........Even if he isn\'t Ushiromiya Battler.
{n}My Onii‐chan came back to me...
Welcome home,
 .........Onii‐chan.........
It had already gotten dark outside.
Even though he had come from far away, he was willing to stay as late as this.
We left the store.
It\'s probably best......if I don\'t meet with Mr. Tohya again.
It will cause him pain, ......and of course, I\'ll find myself bound to the past again.
Even so, just one more time.
{n}There was one place I felt I had to show him.
"......Mr. Tohya.
 ......Would you mind meeting with me just one last time?
 There\'s a place I feel I need to show you."
".....................
 ......Sure, I don\'t mind."
From my handbag, I pulled an invitation, which had been printed on a sheet of A4 paper and folded into four.
The pair of them unfolded it.
"My.
 Now this looks like a splendid event."
".........Come to think of it, you have been involved in a lot of things besides novels, haven\'t you?"
"On that day, would you lend me your time just once more?
 ......That way, I think both me and my brother will be satisfied.
 I think...it might also be a chance for you to free yourself from the weight of my brother\'s memory, Mr. Tohya."
"......I......don\'t believe we have any plans for then.
 As long as we can get the afterword for the book finished ahead of time."
"Okay, Miss Kotobuki.
 ......We\'d be happy to join you."
"Thank you, Mr. Tohya........."
The cold, October night was a reminder that winter was approaching.
......The two people who called themselves Hachijo Tohya visited the city once again by Ange\'s invitation.
A car stopped in front of a large building.
Ikuko unfolded the wheelchair with a practiced hand, lent a shoulder to Tohya as he got out of the passenger\'s seat, and helped him into the chair.
".........It looks splendid."
"The Gospel House.
 ......It\'s my first time coming here, ......but I know it well.
 I believe it\'s the institution for children that was funded by the Ushiromiya family."
"Madam Ikuko, Mr. Tohya.
 Allow us to welcome you to the Gospel House."
They were welcomed by Ange and some staff members.
This was...the Gospel House.
A welfare institution for unfortunate children who had lost their parents.
This institution was once dependent on the support it received from Ushiromiya Kinzo.
However, that support had been interrupted, and the Gospel House had been forced to shut down for a time.
Decades had passed.
 And now, the institution would be revived.
Revived by the hand of Kotobuki Yukari.
"......It\'s a pleasure to see you again, Miss Kotobuki.
 Thank you for your invitation.
 ......This is from the two of us.
 It\'s not much, but I hope the children enjoy it."
"That was never the intention behind inviting you here......
 I feel terrible accepting this......"
"Please don\'t let it concern you.
 ......The tales of the future are always woven by children.
 ......After all, without them, the tale of {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s will not continue."
"Children are treasures.
 So please, let this be useful."
"......Thank you very much.
 ......We have a form for donations, so if it isn\'t too much trouble......"
The Gospel House had been drastically remodeled in recent years.
In the hopes that children would one day be able to remember this as a fun place...
Ange had used her own money to massively remodel it into a beautiful establishment.
......By now, she had accumulated a lot of wealth as a novelist,
 but even without that, she had been saving the tens of millions of yen she got from the Ushiromiya Group each year under the name of living expenses.
This money had been used generously to help the children.
When they came into the entrance hall, a cheerful scene was spread before them.
Pictures and crafts created by the children.
 ......Every corner was filled with things on display.
The contrast between this elegant building and the school atmosphere was amusing.
The yells and laughter of kids running around drifted in from the distance.
".........I imagine that many children first come here hanging their heads in sorrow.
 To think that they could be here laughing like that......... You really have done something great."
"All people can use magic to create their future and find a fragment of happiness.
 ......This is a witch\'s school for teaching that magic."
"The "Witch\'s Dormitory" from "Sakutarou\'s Great Adventure"?"
"......Oh, how embarrassing.
 ......So you\'ve read it too..."
"We read straight through it right after our last meeting.
 ......I really must bow my head, not only to your talent as a writer, but to your warm heart."
"How embarrassing......
 .........This way, straight to the end."
Pushing Tohya\'s wheelchair, we advanced through the corridor and reached the great doors at the end.
The happy voices of children came from the other side.
Apparently, this was where tonight\'s party was being held.
There were several jack‐o‐lanterns cut out of origami.
Tonight...was the Gospel House\'s Halloween party.
"Here you are, Mr. Tohya."
"I see, so it\'s trick‐or‐treat."
He was handed a bag filled with candy.
A teacher warned him in a small voice...
to watch out for rampaging children.
"......Children.
 I haven\'t had anything to do with them for years."
"Please tell the children stories of dreams.
 We all welcome guests here......"
"That\'s tricky...
 What should I tell them?"
"‘When you\'re handing in your manuscript, choose your publishing company wisely’?"
"‘Don\'t pay any attention to reader polls.’"
"*giggle*giggle*.
 Then I\'ll open the doors.
 The children are waiting."
Ange opened the large double doors......
"This......place..........................."
At the sight of the hall......Tohya opened his mouth in wide‐eyed shock.
This was...the great hall of the Ushiromiya mansion.
No, that would be impossible......
They were clearly in the Gospel House.
This hall.........was an exact look‐alike of the one in the Rokkenjima mansion...............
"......What a splendid hall."
"This is......a replica......of the hall in the Ushiromiya mansion.........on Rokkenjima......"
"Yes.
 ......I\'ve reproduced it as well as my memory would let me.
 The details might be wrong though."
"......No.
 .........This really is.........the hall of the Ushiromiya family mansion......on that day......"
And then, Tohya\'s eyes fixed......on something at the other side of the room.
It was.........a portrait.
{n}A portrait of Rokkenjima\'s other master.
"......It\'s.........exactly the same as my memories........."
"The artist hired by Ushiromiya Kinzo to paint the portrait had a photo.
 ......I had him draw it again based on that."
".........................................."
I was simply frozen in shock.
The long, large table was filled with Halloween party food and surrounded with children stuffing themselves.
The teacher said "everyone, we have guests".
......The children all looked at us at once, ......then stood up and ran forward......
Their broad smiles at the arrival of this long‐awaited guest wrapped me up.
The smiles and eyes of the children.........welcomed me.
Yeah, .........I know.
 ......I know......all your faces.........
It\'s been so long, far too long...... I\'m finally here, at last......
