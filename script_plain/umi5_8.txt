......Battler did nothing but gaze lazily out the window.
The fighting between the relatives continued without end......
At first, the relatives had crowded around the study.
However, no matter how much they knocked, the master of the study did not answer even once.
Eva and several others said that they should open the door with the second key, the one Genji held.
However, in a flash of brilliance, Natsuhi said that Kinzo had been in a particularly bad mood and had taken back the key he\'d previously given Genji,
 meaning that he now had both keys himself.
 She claimed that it was therefore impossible for them to open the door.
After she promised to let them meet Kinzo tomorrow morning no matter what, they finally returned to the dining hall.
But, of course, the argument continued on even after they returned there.
Eva\'s group wanted a lot of cash very soon, and they were trying to threaten Krauss somehow and make him pay up.
......Apparently, Battler\'s solving of the epitaph, which threatened Krauss\'s position as the next head,
 had given the others a huge tailwind.
On the other side, Krauss and Natsuhi denied the very basis of their argument,
 claiming that it had never been specified that ownership of the gold would be handed over to the person who solved the epitaph.
They asserted that it hadn\'t been hidden gold, but just Kinzo\'s stockpile,
 and it was still Kinzo\'s property, which meant it was only natural for it to be distributed after Kinzo\'s death with the rest of the inheritance.
After hearing this, Eva\'s group once again started demanding that they be allowed to see Kinzo.
......It had probably been clear as day from the beginning.
This sibling fight could only be settled by Kinzo...
It was obvious that this confrontation was between Eva\'s group, which wanted cash fast,
 and Krauss, who was hiding his lack of funds but still didn\'t need money right away.
As Battler listened vaguely to this exchange,
 ......he marveled at how, despite their usual affluent airs, they were all surprisingly deep in debt...
"Didn\'t you already say that a short while ago?
 That\'s enough, let\'s take a break.
 We\'re all repeating the same things over and over again."
According to the clock, it was almost midnight.
It certainly was a perfect time for a break.
The atmosphere relaxed just a bit...
"I agree.
 It\'d do both sides some good to take a breather.
 ...Listen, why don\'t we take a record down for the rest.
 I\'ve had enough of fighting over what was or wasn\'t said."
"Seriously.
 We really can\'t do without a record of proceedings, not when Nii-san can so easily deny something he\'s said before the words stop bouncing off the walls."
"With a written record, just writing it would be a pain, and it\'d be open to forgery."
"Right.
 ......Aniki, does this thing work?"
"The tape set?
 ...I see.
 This way, we can keep a record without bothering to write it down, and forgery will be impossible.
 It\'s fair for both sides."
"Make sure you don\'t mess anything up...!
 Those are Father\'s precious music tapes!"
The dignified tape set had a sense of weight to it which matched this majestic dining hall perfectly.
On pleasant Sunday mornings, it would sometimes be used to play famous tapes or records.
However, right now, it was the most neutral and impartial conference record keeper around...
Rudolf fished randomly around the cassette rack, searching for a blank tape.
And every time he found some tape with "sophisticated" music, he would chuckle at how pompous it was.
"Excuse me.
 ......You called?"
"We\'re taking a break.
 Sorry, but could you make us something to drink?
 And maybe some biscuits would be nice too."
"Certainly.
 I will prepare it right away......"
"Also, ......sorry.
 Do you have any cold medicine?
 I\'ve been feeling a bit feverish."
"Then don\'t overstrain yourself.
 Get some sleep."
"If you really feel like it, why not get some sleep, Rosa?
 Though I wouldn\'t step out of such an important conference because of a simple cold."
"Really?
 I would excuse myself without hesitation.
 Natsuhi, why don\'t we take a short rest too?"
"............Yes, dear."
Sensing that he meant to have a strategy meeting, Natsuhi stood up.
......Even if that wasn\'t the case, she was so desperate to get out of the room even for a moment that she\'d have taken any excuse.
Krauss and Natsuhi left the dining hall, ......and the tension in the room truly relaxed.
"............Phew."
"You\'ve been doing great, Battler-kun.
 ......I imagine you feel just horrible.
 Think of this as part of growing up and just accept it."
"Just how long am I going to have to sit around doing nothing here?"
"......Who knows.
 After all, you\'re like our personal donation box.
 ......Sleepy?"
"About the same as Japanese Lit class."
"I\'m pretty sure Father won\'t show up tonight anyway.
 When Krauss nii-san and the rest come back, I\'ll propose that we might as well let you go."
"......I\'d appreciate that."
Tap-tap.
A light knock and the faint sound of china clinking together could be heard.
"Excuse us......"
"We have brought tea."
Shannon and Kanon had come by with a serving cart.
The pleasant smell of black tea relieved their tension all the more.
"......Hey.
 Did you hear?"
"What are you talking about......?"
"............We didn\'t hear anything."
"Stop it, Rudolf.
 There\'s no reason to tell them."
"......We are furniture,
 so we have no interest in the family conference."
"I see.
 That\'s a wise answer."
"......You have the midnight shift?
 That must be tough."
"That is our job.
 ......We would be happy to receive your orders."
"You could be right there.
 It\'d probably be even more tiresome to sit around awake doing nothing.
 When I was still down in the bottom rungs, I once worked as a warehouse keeper.
 Even if you\'re just staying awake, it\'s still pretty tough...!
 Right after the war, you had robbers all over the place.
 Plus you couldn\'t rely on the police back then, so it was a pretty dangerous time...!"
Hideyoshi was particularly proud of how he had started with nothing and built up assets by diverting goods from the American army.
Once the subject came up, Hideyoshi tended to get pretty talkative.
The relatives knew this and were greatly relieved to see that a perfect sacrifice had come up.
"If you got found out, you were in for it big time!
 Those Yanks are scary!
 Their strength\'s in another league \'cause of all that beef they eat.
 Get caught and that\'d be the end of ya! Firin\' squad or <death by hanging>!"
"You know that one? <Death by hanging>!
 Oh yeah, and then, I figured it out.
 It\'s all about the meat! The meat!
 Japanese people\'ve gotta eat more meat!
 And that\'s when I had the revelation - I had to start up a business to capture people\'s stomachs!"
"I, ...I see...
 That m-must have been quite a difficult task......"
"Stop it, darling.
 No matter how much you tell people born after the war, they\'ll never understand how hard it was back then."
"Oops, looks like my bad habit\'s jumped out again...!
 Sorry, sorry!
 Wahahahahaha!"
"You two should have some tea as well.
 I think it might help you if once in a while you used your own mouths to learn more about the tea you\'re brewing."
".........No, we\'ll be fine.
 There\'s no need to be concerned for our sakes..."
"Hang out with us for a bit.
 Being surrounded by only adults makes me feel like I\'m gonna suffocate."
"Hear that? That\'s an order from Battler-sama, successor to the head!
 Sit over there and have some tea with us.
 And tell us about what\'s been going on recently, your hobbies, TV shows you\'re watching, and whatever it is that\'s popular with young folks these days.
 There\'s a lot we could learn."
"*giggle*.
 That\'s a brilliant idea.
 Come on, sit down, both of you.
 And become our sacrifices now that we\'re starved of things to talk about."
"Wahahahahahaha.
 That\'s right.
 The only way I\'m gettin\' to talk to young folk at this age is goin\' to a cabaret club."
"......How long are you planning on standing around there?
 Rudolf told you to sit.
 Go on, sit down.
 ......I give you permission as well."
After getting Eva\'s permission, Shannon and Kanon looked at each other and finally obeyed, nervously.
For a while, the two were pounded by questions and became the relatives\' playthings......
Tap-tap.
 Another reserved knock could be heard.
All of the servants tended to knock in a similar manner,
 so no one noticed anything strange.
However, Shannon and Kanon turned around with surprised looks on their faces.
......The servants here today included the two of them, Genji, Kumasawa, and Gohda.
Gohda had the midnight shift at the guesthouse.
Kumasawa had gone to bed in the servants\' quarters in the guesthouse.
And they were in here, ......so Genji was the only person left,
 ...but they knew very well that Genji wouldn\'t knock like that......
"......Who is it?
 It\'s not locked. Just come in."
Rudolf didn\'t recognize the knock either.
And when he asked "Who is it?", everyone came to the same realization that they too had no idea who would knock like that......
After that, the same knock repeated just once more.
......Could it be that someone had their hands full...and was asking that the door be opened for them...?
As a slightly odd feeling began to encompass the room, the sound of the large clock in the hall could be heard.
It was the sign that October 4th had ended and October 5th had begun......
A short while earlier - 
Krauss and Natsuhi were well away from the dining hall, in a deserted corridor on the second floor......
".........So, we no longer have any other options."
"Yes...
 ......I do not think the same trick will work again tomorrow.
 ...If we hesitate any longer, there\'s a chance that Eva-san and the others will claim that we have Father locked up and call the police.
 This is......as far as we can go."
"................................."
"......Battler-kun finding the gold......was completely unexpected.
 If only that hadn\'t happened, I\'d thought of a plan which might have managed to get us through this somehow......"
"......Hmph.
 Just like every other bet I\'ve made.
 ...Something unexpected always arises, and the "guaranteed" outcome is thrown off course."
".........We\'ll have Father\'s room be empty starting tomorrow morning.
 Let\'s plan it out with Genji and have him say that he saw Father heading out into the forest early in the morning."
"I doubt Eva and the others will swallow that story of his disappearance..."
"I\'m fully aware of that.
 However, we have no other options...!"
"If we do such a thing, ......Eva and the others will doubtless make a fuss about it being suspicious.
 They aren\'t worried about appearances as long as they can squeeze some money out of us.
 ...They might strike a deal with some odd magazine and cause serious damage to the confidence placed in me."
"We can live with damage...!
 If by any chance Father\'s secret is discovered, it won\'t be a matter of mere damage...!!"
"There\'s nothing wrong with persisting until the last second tomorrow.
 If we\'re able to make it through safely, we won\'t have to lose anything.
 There\'s no need to get impatient and use up our trump card...!"
"You want to wait until after they start accusing us of locking Father up, and then reply that he\'s gone missing?
 That is far more likely to draw suspicion...!!"
"........................nnnn......"
"......Let\'s just...
put Father to rest now...
 To go any further...
......would be impossible......"
"Calm yourself.
 You\'ve just had too much exposure to the toxin from Eva and the others and have lost your composure.
 ......Only two keys exist which can let anyone into that study!
 And you have both of them right here.
 That means no one can go inside.
 That door is of a very special make.
 No matter what kind of tools they bring out of the storehouse, it won\'t even budge."
"It isn\'t a physical problem like that...!"
"Look, stop panicking, settle down.
 If you like, you can pretend to have gotten a fever and stay in bed.
 In the meantime, I will overcome all of this."
"......I can\'t leave everything to you...!
 I\'ll fight until the end too...!"
When Natsuhi could no longer hold back the tears brought on by her fierce emotions, ......Krauss held her gently.
......Just how long had it been since she\'d last felt warmth from her husband\'s embrace......
"Your headache.........is killing you, isn\'t it?
 Whenever you get those creases between your eyebrows, I can tell."
"............Dear......"
She had come to think that her husband could never understand the way she felt.
But, ......when it came to times like this.........
"......Let\'s wait for the very last moment before using our disappearance trump card.
 It\'s like a last-resort treasured sword:
 it\'s best when it remains in its sheath.
 The important thing is being ready to pull it out at any time, wouldn\'t you agree...?"
"I......understand that..."
"Why don\'t you leave that trump card with me?
 .........Of course, at the final moment, I will take all of the responsibility.
 ......I won\'t get you and Jessica involved."
"What...do you mean by that...?!"
"If the Ushiromiya family is destroyed, it is enough that I alone am crushed under the rubble.
 .........After the typhoon passes, I will prepare divorce forms.
 I will sign the papers for you to keep and use when you please.
 ......I have some assets hidden away in your name.
 Add on the settlement, and it should be enough for you and Jessica to live in comfort."
"No!!
 Ushiromiya Natsuhi is the name that should be engraved on my tombstone...!
 Please let me be with you until the last moment...!
 Even if it turns out that you are the last head of the Ushiromiya family,
 ......please let Natsuhi...
...be the name of his wife...
...your wife......"
......Krauss\'s existence was based solely upon the power of his assets and his trustworthiness as a financial fixer.
If those were both undermined, nothing would remain.
Using the trump card of Kinzo\'s disappearance would mean losing one of these two essential supports.
......It was like offering your right arm to save your head from being cut off.
It was probably better than losing your head, but you still might die from the blood loss,
 and even on the off-chance that you did survive, you would have to bear a heavy wound that wouldn\'t heal for the rest of your life......
Krauss was prepared even for death......
Natsuhi understood this,
 ......buried her face in Krauss\'s chest,
 ...and cried...
"............My apologies for interrupting."
Genji\'s sudden voice made Natsuhi jump back and hurriedly wipe the tears from her eyes.
Krauss stood in front of Natsuhi, shielding her.
"Ah, Genji-san.
 Please don\'t sneak up on us.
 ......Do you have some business?"
".........Yes.
 My apologies, but I have something to report to Madam."
"To......me......?
 Dear......"
"I don\'t mind."
Krauss left Natsuhi\'s side, went to a window a short way off,
 and gazed at the windy and rainy rose garden......
Natsuhi went with Genji to a place a short distance away.
"......What is it?"
".........Well...
 The truth is, another phone call has come for you, Madam."
At that moment, she was surprised by a sudden, eerie sound.
It was the large clock in the hall announcing midnight...
"You don\'t mean............that man......again...?"
".........Yes.
 ......What is to be done?"
"D-......did he say what business he had with me?"
".........He would not answer.
 He kept insisting that he wanted to speak to you directly."
".............................."
Again, ...a phone call......from the man who claimed to be taking revenge for what had happened 19 years ago.
19 years ago.
......That was just one year before Jessica and Battler were born.
In Natsuhi\'s eyes, the gap between 19 years ago and 18 years ago was immense.
......For a long time, she was unable to fulfill her role of creating a successor for the Ushiromiya family...and was treated very coldly.
But then, she finally gave birth to Jessica...
and became able to call herself the wife to the Ushiromiya successor with her head held high.
......So in her eyes, "Ushiromiya Natsuhi" began 18 years ago.
......So everything before that, including 19 years ago......contained nothing but hateful memories.
The last year of that hateful period.........was whispering of revenge...from the other end of the phone......
.........Once again......she heard the roar of the sea......
....................................
".........What is to be done?"
"Transfer it......to my room.
 ......Don\'t let my husband know."
"......As you wish."
From the very beginning, Genji had understood that she wouldn\'t want Krauss hearing about this phone call.
That was why he had told Natsuhi covertly......
Natsuhi ordered that he transfer the call, told Krauss that she would turn in for the night, and left at a quick pace......
She returned to her room and locked the door.
...There\'s nothing peculiar about that.
......In the Ushiromiya family, hallways are like public roads.
There\'s no special meaning in locking the door when you enter your own room...
...This is what she told herself.
Then, as though it had been waiting for her, the telephone rang.
...Genji must have transferred the call.
She took a deep breath, readied herself, ............and picked up the receiver.
"............Hello........."
".............................."
Again, ......it started with silence.
She realized that the person at the other end was trying to keep her in suspense and make her feel uncomfortable, and she got angry...
"Why are you silent...?!
 I\'m hanging up...!"
"...Hahahahahahaha...
 ......Don\'t hang up, Mother.
 I want to hear your voice a little longer......"
Again......that unpleasant voice......
"Are you trying to mock me...?!
 State your business...!"
"I want to play with you, Mother."
"...Wh-......what?
 What are you talking about?!
 I have no desire to play with you...!!"
"......You\'re tired from the family conference, right?
 I\'ll bet that chronic headache of yours is giving you a bad time."
"Th-that\'s none of your business...!"
Just the fact that he knew her headache was troubling her made a shiver run up her spine...
"You get headaches because your head\'s all stiff.
 You won\'t have pleasant dreams if you go straight to bed like that."
"Haven\'t I told you that\'s none of your business?!!
 I\'m hanging up!!"
Natsuhi forcefully yelled that she was hanging up, but in actuality, she couldn\'t...
After all, this person was choosing to call her, and that was much better than the alternative.
......If she hung up violently,
 ...this person might choose to call someone else...
"Let\'s play a bit to help you relax.
 Don\'t worry, I won\'t take up much of your time."
"I, ...I have no intention of playing with you......!"
"......Your name is Natsuhi, Mother.
 It has the kanji for a season in it.
 Pretty nice name.
 .........However, just because your name is Natsuhi, that doesn\'t necessarily mean that you like summer.
 ...Which season is your real favorite, Mother......?"
"You think I\'ll tell you?"
"If you don\'t, ......I\'ll hang up.
 .........Are you sure you want that?"
"...kh.................."
It was clearly a threat.
......It meant that if she forced him to hang up the phone,
 anything might happen......
Humiliated that she was forced to give in to a threat made by a man whose name she didn\'t even know, she gave him the answer he wanted......
".........I-.........it\'s autumn."
"Why......?"
"B-because it\'s an easy season to pass the time in...!
 There\'s no other reason in particular.
 Are you satisfied now?!"
"Yeah, I\'m satisfied.
 ......It looks like your favorite season really is the same as mine.
 ......I like the fall too.
 .........Heheheheheheheheheheheheh..."
"......Liar!
 You just made that up...!"
This man would no doubt have done the same thing no matter which season I said I liked.
......What is he after?!
What\'s so fun about making me uncomfortable like this...?!
"It\'s not nice to call someone a liar.
 ......I didn\'t make it up.
 I was already certain that you liked the fall, Mother.
 .........I can even show you proof."
"Proof.........?"
"Yeah.
 ......Is there a clock in your room, Mother...?"
"...A clock......?
 Y-......yes, there is, but what\'s your point......?"
In Natsuhi\'s room, there was a beautiful antique clock with an intricate design.
......Krauss had bought it for her as a birthday present long ago.
".........It\'s seven minutes past midnight right now.
 I\'m tired, so please get this farce over with quickly...!"
"Try lifting the clock up."
"Wh-why?"
".........You just don\'t know when to shut up.
 Stop resisting every single time I say something.
 Just shut up and do what I say."
The tone of the man\'s voice suddenly went low, turning into a threat.
It indicated clear displeasure.
Outwardly, this man had a calm manner of speaking, but on the inside, things were completely different.
If she angered this man even the slightest bit further, he would surely show his true nature right away...
"......Are you really that eager to make me hang up?
 You\'d better start realizing how lucky you are that I\'m talking on the phone with you right now......
 ...I can tell your husband and daughter about what happened 19 years ago any time I want to..."
"I, I don\'t know what you\'re talking about, but please don\'t get my husband and daughter involved...!
 I\'m listening to everything you say...!"
"Then do what you\'re goddamn told......"
Once again, the man threatened me in a low voice, as though warning me never to talk back to him again...
My head was filled with the pain from my headache, the sound of my beating heart, ......and the roar of the sea...
......I couldn\'t disobey him anymore.
.........As the man had ordered, I lifted up the antique clock...
".................................?"
There lay something that resembled a single playing card.
............?
Perhaps it was the warranty for the clock.........?
Thinking this, she took it and turned it over............
"Are you.........wide awake now?"
"Eek, ah,
 ......aaaaaaaahhhhh......
 Wh-
wh-wh-
why...
 ...Why is...
...this...?!?!"
"Well, I\'ll be happy if your headache\'s gone down a bit.
 ......Tell me you\'re happy, Mother."
"How did you...?!
 Why?!
 How?!"
"I want you to tell me you\'re happy, you murderer.
 How dare you act like a normal, neat-freak mother. You make me want to vomit.
 Do you want some of it to land on your husband and daughter as well?
 You don\'t, do you?
 You want me to keep quiet, don\'t you?
 Yeah, I\'ll keep quiet. See, aren\'t you happy?
 Aren\'t you happy?!"
"Ah, .........aaaah, I\'m happy... I\'m happy...!!
 So please...stop...
 Don\'t burden my husband and daughter...!
 What is it you want?
 Money?
 How much?!"
"I don\'t want money.
 ......My wounds couldn\'t be healed with any amount of money.
 But there is a medicine.
 ......Yes,
 it\'s like a kind of ointment.
 ......Thick, syrupy and dribbling."
"............And that is...
my hatred,
 ......my resentment towards you.
 ...Slathering myself with that...
is the only way to hold back the pain..."
Natsuhi had never had anything so hateful said to her in her entire life.
So she suspected many times that she must be having some sort of bad dream.
However, ......this definitely wasn\'t a dream...
"......Y-
...you couldn\'t possibly be...
...on this island right now, could you...?"
"I am.
 Didn\'t I promise you?
 I said I\'d be at the family conference."
"That\'s impossible...!
 There\'s no way you could have come during this typhoon...!!"
"That\'s no problem if I came before the typhoon reached here.
 ......And I\'m pretty sure this guest called Erika or whatever arrived even during the typhoon."
Her blood froze......
Furudo Erika had been brought here by coincidence...
If he knew that name, he would have to be very close by......
"Wh-
......where...
...a-
......are you.........?"
"......I won\'t appear in front of anyone until you introduce me.
 Don\'t worry.
 .........Oh yeah, it\'s useless to try and search for me.
 Your mansion is huge.
 And you have phones all over the place.
 Besides, I\'m sure you don\'t want to see me either, do you?"
"......Or are you offering to find me and introduce me to everyone...?
 Introduce me to Jessica too.
 ......Tell her I\'m her older brother by one year.
 Heheheheheheheheheheheheheheh!!"
"S-stop it...... Stay away from Jessica......"
"I guess I\'ve scared you a bit too much.
 That\'s all from me...for tonight.
 ......But don\'t forget.
 You cannot disobey me.
 Understand,
 ......Mother?"
"......Y-.........yes......"
"I\'m going to hang up for the night, ......but I have an order to be followed up until tomorrow morning."
"Wh-......what is that.........?"
"You may no longer leave that room tonight, and you may not make any phone calls.
 If the phone rings, you aren\'t allowed to pick it up, either.
 And you will turn the lights off right now, get in bed, and sleep.
 Then you will wake up at your ordinary time.
 ............Heheheheheh.
 It sure is nice to live a healthy life.
 I really am such a good son, working so hard for the sake of my Mother\'s body......"
"I, ......I understand.
 I\'ll sleep right now.
 I won\'t leave my room, and I won\'t pick up the phone...!
 So please, don\'t tell my husband and daughter......!"
"As long as you follow my orders, I\'ll keep your secret, Mother.
 ......Don\'t disobey me.
 ......I\'m already very close by.
 I can easily tell whether you\'ve turned your lights off and whether you\'re on the phone.
 ...If I wished to, I could even kiss your sleeping face."
"I\'ll keep it!
 I\'ll keep my promise!!
 So stop it, just stop it!
 Stop iiiiiiiiiiiiiiittt!!"
......As she screamed, Natsuhi crushed the card she had found under the clock into a little ball.
It had a pattern on it like a tarot card,
 along with one single word:
 "Autumn".........
We go back in time once again.
The large clock in the hall was right in the middle of striking midnight.
Wondering who the person who had now knocked twice was,
 ......the relatives in the dining hall stared at the door.
Rudolf told them to come in.
 ......But there was no answer.
Until the end of that long tone marking the coming of midnight, which had come from the large clock in the hall shortly after the knock,
 they were unable to move in the slightest......
"......Maybe their hands are full and they can\'t open it......"
"Maybe.
 ......But it\'s a little creepy that they won\'t say their name."
"......Should I open it?"
"Do it."
Kanon nodded back, then slowly opened the door......
"Ah, ......what\'s that...?!"
"......It\'s......one of Dad\'s envelopes?"
Right behind the opened door, on the floor of the hallway,
 ......lay the envelope.
"There\'s no one in the hallway.
 Perhaps they placed this here and left..."
The adults flew out into the corridor as well,
 but they could find no trace of anyone who might have knocked on the door......
Barely an hour ago, Shannon and Kanon had come in to serve tea.
At that time, everyone had seen that nothing lay in that spot.
Someone came, knocked, left an envelope with the mark of the One-winged Eagle on it, and left...
"C-......could it have been...the Master......?!"
"......It\'s not unthinkable.
 ......Father\'s pretty much the only person in this mansion who would refuse to answer when asked who he was."
"That\'s not possible.
 If that\'s so, then why didn\'t Father come in here openly?"
"......That\'s right.
 Father would probably just come in here all of a sudden without knockin\'...
 The doors and windows of this mansion are locked now, right...?
 In that case, the only people who could\'ve left the letter there are Krauss-san, Natsuhi-san, and Genji-san."
By this point, the mansion had been completely locked up.
Therefore, those in the guesthouse - the cousins, Nanjo, Gohda, Kumasawa, and Erika - could not have come here.
Furthermore, since Krauss, Natsuhi, and Genji were the only three who weren\'t in this room,
 one of those three had to have been the one who set that letter down in the corridor.
In that case, it was very likely that Krauss and the others had placed the letter there to make it seem like a message from Kinzo...
"I see...
 It\'ll have something written on it which is supposedly in Father\'s name, saying that he won\'t accept Battler-kun as the next head, or something of the sort.
 Ridiculous.
 I can\'t believe you\'d try to pull such a childish trick, Nii-san...!"
"It\'s not like I have any interest in being the next head..."
"Give up.
 This is just your fate.
 ......Anyway, why don\'t we read what\'s inside?"
Rudolf set the letter on the dining hall table and showed everyone the front and back,
 almost like a magician does before performing his act to show that there are no tricks or hidden mechanisms.
"......This envelope is without a doubt Father\'s?"
"Y-...yes, there\'s no doubt.
 Father liked to use these envelopes for handwritten letters...
 What do you think, Shannon-chan?"
"Y-yes......
 ......To my eyes as well, ......it looks like the type of envelope that the Master uses..."
"That doesn\'t mean Father was the one who wrote it.
 It would be pitifully easy for Nii-san to snatch one of these from a drawer in Father\'s study...!"
"Even Krauss-sama cannot easily enter the study...
 It might be hard for him to steal an envelope......"
"Let\'s try opening it.
 We can think about this later.
 ......There\'s something in it.
 I wonder what."
Rudolf opened the envelope a bit roughly.
Then, a folded letter...
...and a glittering object fell out.
......It was a ring.
"Huh?
 ............Wait a second, ...that ring is......!"
Eva noticed it immediately and grabbed it...
"Th-
......this is...
...Father\'s ring...!
 I-it\'s the Head\'s Ring!!"
"......Wh-...what in the...!!
 Seriously?!"
"Are you sure it\'s Father\'s ring...?
 Could it be a replica...?"
"No, this is the real thing!
 I\'ve always dreamed about wearing this ring on my finger someday.
 Even though Father wore this on his finger, I know more about it than anyone else.
 ......This is Father\'s ring, no doubt about it!
 Why is it here?!"
"Then it really was Father who wrote this letter...?!"
"......Heh, heheheheh.
 The sender isn\'t Dad.
 ...It\'s someone much more interesting."
"Then, ......who is the letter from?"
"It\'s from the Ushiromiya family alchemist!
 .........The Golden Witch, BEATRICE-sama......!!"
Rudolf showed everyone the part of the letter where that was written.
It really did say that......
"I-......it\'s from BEATRICE......?!"
"What\'s it say......?"
"I\'ll read it.
 .........<Congratulations>...
 I acknowledge that Battler-sama has spectacularly solved the riddle of the epitaph and reached the Golden Land.
 .........The gold belongs to him in its entirety.
 Furthermore, he is also the new head of the Ushiromiya family.
 ......As proof, ............I send the Head\'s Ring, which Kinzo-sama left in my charge...
 ......Battler-sama, I beg that you put on this ring, become the new master of the gold, and lead the Ushiromiya family into the future.
 ......I pray with utmost sincerity that you flourish as the new head............"
"......Hah, ......hahah!
 What the hell...!
 I see, Dad just won\'t come out of his study, so BEATRICE, the witch of the forest, has acknowledged Battler directly...!
 Hahaha, hahahahahahahahaha!"
"......Battler-kun.
 You should hold onto this ring.
 ......This is a special ring to be worn by the family head.
 .........I don\'t know who this BEATRICE is,
 but she\'s watched the whole thing and sent you this ring after acknowledging you as the true successor."
"I-......is that alright...?
 It\'s such an important ring......"
"Yeah, it\'s fine.
 You should wear it proudly on your finger.
 ......Got it? Even if Aniki and Natsuhi-san tell you to take it off, you better not do it no matter what...!"
With creepy smiles on their faces, all of the relatives urged Battler to put the ring on his finger...
It looked like things would get pretty nasty if he refused, so Battler reluctantly decided to put it on the middle finger of his left hand......
The ring was heavy and stiff......
At that moment, Krauss returned.
......Genji came back as well immediately afterwards.
"My apologies.
 It looks like my wife isn\'t feeling so well, so she\'s gone to bed early.
 ............Did something happen?
 You all seem incredibly flustered."
"..................Battler-sama, ......that........."
Immediately, Genji keenly spotted the thing that Battler had just put on his finger...
"Your eyesight\'s pretty good, Genji-san!
 ......Looks like you know whose ring this is."
"What...?
 What are you talking about......?"
From Krauss\'s questioning look, it was very difficult to imagine that he could have been the one who set that letter there......
Furthermore, his expression quickly changed into one of shock.
"Eheheheheh!!
 That\'s right, it\'s the ring of the Ushiromiya family head!!"
The family conference took up this new topic,
 ......and the storm came once again.........
The rain was still pouring down as hard as ever.
......This weather was supposed to continue all day tomorrow as well, which was making me feel a bit depressed.
......Oh wait...given the time, that\'s today, not tomorrow...
But that doesn\'t really matter now.
.........I\'m sleepy...
With half-asleep eyes, I opened my umbrella.
The large drops of rain pounded against it mercilessly.........
Technically, they had called an end to the family conference at 1 a.m.,
 but the post-match scuffles were still dragging on.
I was really jealous of Auntie Rosa, who managed to slip out of there at that time.
She cleverly got away by saying that she\'d check on Maria, who might have been staying up too late.
Thanks to Dad constantly involving me, I missed my chance to escape,
 ...and they made me stick around until now, ......3 a.m....
What on Earth did they spend all that time deciding...?
Nothing got decided at all.
......They just kept on arguing about who said what, like elementary school kids.
......They must be tired too.
I\'m sure that\'s why they keep dragging on with the same pointless questions.
I no longer felt any shock or anger towards them.
I guess no painkiller works better than drowsiness...
......I left them behind and finally returned to the guesthouse.
When I returned to the guesthouse, the lights were on in the lounge downstairs.
Not only that, I could even hear people chatting inside......
Apparently, some people were still awake even at this time of night.
Despite the late hour, Gohda-san and Doctor Nanjo were still awake and chatting.
Plates and cups were lined up on the counter,
 and it looked almost like a bar with Gohda-san as the bartender.
After noticing I\'d come back, it looked as though Doctor Nanjo finally realized how late it was.
As Gohda-san made to top off his glass, he declined with an exaggerated gesture.
"No, that\'s enough, that\'s enough.
 ......It\'s already too late to be up."
"Look how late it\'s gotten...
 You were such a good person to chat with, I hardly noticed."
"No, no, it was your skill at entertaining that made the difference.
 We\'ll have to do this again sometime."
"Yes, gladly!
 Battler-sama, welcome back.
 Is the discussion with Krauss-sama and the others still continuing?"
"......The way things were going, they\'ll probably drag it all the way out until dawn.
 None of my business..."
I spoke carelessly, with a big yawn.
".........You all have more stamina than I expected.
 It\'s quite a surprise."
"Oh, ......so you\'re here too..."
"......Yes, a humble little night gathering had begun to form quite naturally here,
 so I took it upon myself to join.
 .........Don\'t worry, I haven\'t said a word about you-know-what."
"..........................."
Erika could be seen on the sofa.
She had taken her shoes off and was lounging around as though she owned the place.
"And you too, Erika-sama - you are very knowledgeable on a variety of subjects.
 I enjoyed listening to you immensely."
"Your knowledge truly is extensive.
 Very impressive for one so young..."
".........You\'re very welcome.
 It\'s merely the trivial knowledge of Furudo Erika."
Erika posed by picking up the hem of her skirt.
She was lounging on the sofa with her feet up, so it didn\'t look remotely elegant.
"......Where\'s Auntie Rosa?"
"She returned around 1 a.m., but she went straight upstairs to sleep."
That was probably the right choice...
She\'d been going along with that conference for so long.
 I feel like flopping down in bed right away myself.
......I\'ve had it.
I\'m tired enough that I might flop over right here...
".........Well then, let\'s call it a night.
 Don\'t you have to get up early tomorrow morning to make breakfast, Gohda-san?"
"Preparations for breakfast have already been made.
 As always, I have full confidence that you will enjoy it greatly, so please look forward to it."
In Gohda-san\'s eyes, the family conference is an open stage on which to display his culinary skills.
He\'s probably so pumped up he won\'t even get sleepy.
As she laughed at how youthful Gohda was, Erika stood up.
This acted as the sign that it was time to disperse.
"I will clean up here.
 Please enjoy your sleep, everyone."
Leaving the clean-up to Gohda-san, I went to the bathroom and then climbed the stairs to the second floor.
"Goodnight, everyone.
 These old bones have stayed up a little too late."
".........Good night, Doctor Nanjo.
 Good night, Battler-san."
"Yeah.
 .........Night..."
Then, in the upstairs hallway, we split up.
Doctor Nanjo went to his own room.
Erika went to her room.
And I returned to the cousins\' room.
I couldn\'t hear any sounds of playing coming from the cousins\' room.
......Could they have already gone to sleep?
No surprise, at this time of night.
If they were still playing, they would have been staying up way too late...
When I opened the door quietly,
 as expected, the room was already pitch black except for a small nightlight.
Everyone was already sleeping in their beds.
I bet they all had a great time horsing around.
......They probably had a ton of fun staying up late and talking about their youth.
......If only I hadn\'t found the gold, I could have had fun spending time with them...
I\'m already...
tired...
...so tired.
Forgetting even to change my clothes or brush my teeth,
 I crawled into bed,
 .........and immediately started to sink into the marshes of sleep.........
Aaah, ......today\'s been so insane......
I wonder if that old bastard is still in that family conference now......
......How does he not get tired............?
Come to think of it......
......what was it that old bastard said when we parted company......?
 -  Tomorrow, there\'s something important I want to talk about, as a family.
 It\'s about you.
......I\'m sure it\'s more stuff about being the successor.
...I don\'t even want to hear about it......
 -  If I tell you about this,
 ......I\'m probably gonna get murdered.
I\'ll murder you whenever you want, you old bastard......
And then, ......what was it he said next......?
 -  It\'s about your birth.
My...
............birth......?
......Probably just something about the noble Ushiromiya lineage......
Not interested......
.........Just let me
......sleep.........
