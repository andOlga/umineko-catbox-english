There was no way to notice the coming of morning without opening a window and looking at the cloudy sky, which had become a tiny bit lighter.
It wasn\'t a refreshing morning.
 All that could be heard was the sound of the rain, which had kept falling since last night, and the howl of the wind...
"......It\'s hard to imagine that it\'s morning.
 This horrible weather reflects our hearts."
"Then I\'d say it\'s pretty gentle, considering.
 We should count ourselves lucky it\'s rain that\'s falling and not spears."
"Wahaha.
 Whether it\'s rain or spears, bring it on, I say."
".........Is it already six o\'clock?
 Fuaaaaaa...
 Isn\'t this enough?
 Can\'t do much else until the mystery 19th person, {f:5:Beatrice}, takes action."
"That is correct.
 ......However, I believe we have thought of almost every trick they could use against us."
"Yes.
 As long as a traitor doesn\'t appear among us siblings, we should be able to deal with most situations."
"......Haven\'t we talked about this enough?
 We ended up staying up all night.
 ...I\'m tired."
"You\'re right.
 How about taking a little rest after eating breakfast?"
"...A good plan.
 Staying up all night is trying at my age."
As they all stretched, they enjoyed this unrefreshing morning as best they could.
"Let\'s go wash our faces or something.
 I probably look horrible."
"..................?
 What is that horrible stench?"
As soon as they exited into the corridor, Kyrie made an openly disgusted expression.
"...What\'s the matter?"
"Hey, don\'t you smell something awful...?"
".........Hm.
 ...What is this stench?
 It\'s unbearable..."
Because of that fuss, everyone stuck their heads out into the corridor.
...It was a faint stench, but after the complaints, they clearly noticed it.
Each of them went into the corridor, relying on their own sense of smell to tell them where this strange odor was coming from...
"What in the world could it be?
 Let us have Genji deal with it.
 I believe he should already have arrived in the servant room to begin the morning preparations."
"Mmhm, please.
 It is difficult to imagine that Gohda, of all people,
 could be making a breakfast that would cause this kind of stench..."
Rudolf\'s group searched for the source of the smell, and determined that it was coming from underground,
 from the boiler room.
But the door was locked, and they couldn\'t check inside.
Meanwhile, Natsuhi\'s group were on their way to search for someone in the servant room, when they noticed something strange about the parlor.
"......What is this...?!"
"Wh‐what a horrible prank...
 Who would do something like..."
Drawn on the door to the parlor, in a paint that reminded one of blood, there was a strange...
magic‐circle‐like thing.
"No one has come to the kitchen yet.
 ......Wh‐what is...that?"
Eva\'s group, who had thought the smell had been coming from the kitchen,
 had returned, having observed that no one was there and that preparations for breakfast had not yet begun.
......And they noticed the unusual state of the parlor.
"It\'s no good, the boiler room is locked.
 Wouldn\'t it be bad if something\'s broken down in the boiler room?
 Was there a servant anywhere around?"
".........!
 Is that vulgar graffiti here too?
 There was also one on the door to the boiler room."
"What\'s that?!
 This creepy graffiti isn\'t just here, it\'s in other places as well?!
 Haha, you don\'t think that this is the witch of the forest {f:5:Beatrice}\'s declaration of war, right?"
Hideyoshi tried to make fun of it, but staring at this creepy magic circle while listening to the wind and rain really made it seem like it was a message from a witch.
...The dripping bright‐red paint made one think of blood, and it made things even more eerie.
Hideyoshi tried to open the door, but it was locked.
...As a general rule, the parlor was never locked.
Someone had gone out of their way to lock it.
"......What does this mean...?
 Did someone secretly leave this graffiti while we were talking in the dining hall?
 On the doors to the parlor and the boiler room?"
"...I\'m sure the servants are behind this.
 We were together the whole time.
 We all have alibis.
 ......They probably did this prank on some strange orders from Father."
".........Considering the incident yesterday with Maria‐chan\'s letter,
 it\'s more than possible to suspect that the servants are acting on Dad\'s orders and planning something.
 ......Where the hell is everyone, anyway?
 They can\'t be playing hide and seek.
 Let\'s look for them."
"B‐...before that, I\'m worried about the children.
 They\'re alright, aren\'t they?
 I\'ll go and check, and while I\'m there, I\'ll see if there aren\'t any servants there."
"Then let\'s split up.
 While you go to the guesthouse to see how the brats are doing, we\'ll check around inside the mansion.
 .........I don\'t want to think about it,
 but maybe these creepy magic circles aren\'t just where we\'ve found them."
"......We might have become involved in a bizarre game of Father\'s.
 ...I will go to him and ask about the situation.
 ......Though I doubt he\'ll be good‐natured enough to listen to me."
The adults split up.
As a result, they confirmed that the four children were safe in the so‐called cousins\' room, on the second floor of the guesthouse.
It appeared that they had stayed up late last night playing.
All of them were snoring loudly, so Rosa decided not to wake them.
Furthermore, Nanjo, who had returned early the previous night to rest, was also alright.
It seemed he believed in the phrase "early to bed, early to rise", and had awoken refreshed.
During that time, Kyrie and Hideyoshi searched for the servants.
But they didn\'t find them.
...The servant room in the guesthouse was also empty.
"......The children are alright.
 All of them stayed up too late last night."
"The servant room is empty.
 ...I looked at the shift chart, and the mornin\' shift was supposed to begin at six.
 They should have started workin\' by now..."
"The nap room was also empty.
 There were signs that the futons had been used, but they weren\'t warm."
"Y\'know what, I think Krauss nii‐san and the others might\'ve hit on it, don\'t you?
 ......This is probably a game planned on Father\'s orders.
 I\'d bet my bottom dollar, he left those creepy scribbles and hid himself somewhere,
 tryin\' to make us do somethin\'."
"......Are you saying that he\'s trying to see who is fit to inherit his wealth and the family headship?
 ...Isn\'t that a bit..."
"No...
 ...It might not be strange if Father was behind something like that."
"After all, Father loves big tricks.
 ......He might have had this plan brewing ever since that epitaph was hung in the hall."
"...In that case, I wonder whether he will make an announcement of the game or an explanation of it.
 ......It also seems possible that another envelope with the crest might appear, like the one handed to Maria‐chan."
"............You\'re right.
 Maybe Nii‐san and the rest have found that in the mansion."
"Doctor Nanjo.
 Have you heard anythin\'?"
"......M‐my apologies, I do not have any idea what is going on.
 And yet, ......yes, I see,
 I could easily imagine that Kinzo‐san is planning something big."
"...Why don\'t we go back to the mansion for now?
 Maybe they found somethin\' over there."
"If I will not be in the way, I will come too."
"I, I\'ll stay here.
 ...The children are sleeping upstairs.
 We don\'t know what\'s happening.
 We can\'t leave them alone."
"......Yes, you\'re right.
 I\'ll stay with Rosa‐san and watch over the place.
 Would you tell that to my husband?"
Rosa and Kyrie remained in the guesthouse.
Hideyoshi went with Nanjo, and returned again to the mansion.
Meanwhile, in the mansion...
Unbelievably, ...or maybe we should say that bad feelings have a tendency to be right...
Rudolf\'s prediction was right on.
...Because the same magic circle graffiti that had been drawn on the doors to the boiler room and the parlor had been found in multiple other places throughout the mansion.
"Aniki...!
 How\'s Dad?"
"No, no good.
 There was no response at all.
 I did try putting my ear against the door, but I couldn\'t sense anyone."
"...I cannot find the servants anywhere.
 ...Where in the world did they disappear off to..."
"This isn\'t funny.
 Father and the servants are hiding, and there are strange magic circles all over the mansion.
 ......What in the world is happening...?!"
There weren\'t only magic circles on the door to the boiler room and the door to the parlor.
There were also two on the second floor,
 and one on the third floor, for a total of five.
They were all the same magic circle, and all of the doors were locked, so they couldn\'t check inside.
"...Anyway, let\'s do something about the boiler room first.
 It would be bad if some kind of breakdown caused a fire or an explosion.
 ...So we need the key."
"I believe there was a key box in the servant room."
They fished through the key box in the servant room.
Because each servant individually carried their own master key around, those weren\'t kept here.
However, all of the individual room keys should have been here.
"............It\'s so packed with keys."
"...It isn\'t here.
 I\'ve looked and looked, but I can\'t find the key to the boiler room."
"Look, Aneki.
 ......Only the keys to the rooms with those magic circles drawn on them...
are just neatly missing."
"......It\'s true.
 ...How troublesome......"
"It\'s as though someone doesn\'t want us to go in the rooms with the magic circles.
 ......No, they went to all the trouble of making them obvious using the magic circles, so perhaps they do want us to enter...?"
"I think it\'s the latter.
 ...Breaking down the door is probably impossible, I mean, this isn\'t a movie.
 Smashing a window might work."
Krauss had a little trouble deciding whether this was a situation that called for smashing a window.
At that time, Hideyoshi and Nanjo returned.
There was nothing strange in the guesthouse, and the children were safe.
They told the others that Rosa and Kyrie had stayed to watch over the place.
"Good morning.
 ...I hear that something strange has happened."
"Good morning, Doctor Nanjo.
 ...I apologize for waking you so early in the morning."
"What is it?
 Didn\'t you find a letter or somethin\'?
 I was sure you would have found somethin\' like that by now..."
"......You\'re right.
 I also believe that this is a massive joke or game of Father\'s...
 But if that was the case, there should be some letter telling us about that.
 Like the letter that was given to Maria‐chan."
"What if the announcement of the game actually was Maria‐chan\'s letter?
 The details of the game—‘try to solve the riddle of the epitaph’—have already been shown."
"Then, what could the five magic circles we found in the mansion mean?
 ...And the missing servants."
"......Natsuhi nee‐san.
 How many servants were there total today...?"
"Huh?
 .........Genji, Gohda,
 ......five of them, why?"
"......Five servants.
 And five magic circles.
 ......It may be a coincidence, but it worries me."
"...Nii‐san.
 Let\'s break a window.
 We should check and see what\'s inside."
"............We have no choice.
 Do it neatly."
Krauss made his decision, and gave permission to smash a window.
And they decided that the first room they would break into would be the parlor on the first floor, where the windows would be easiest to reach.
They had hoped to peek in through the window,
 but the curtains were drawn, so they couldn\'t see inside.
Rudolf wandered around the garden, trying to find something that would be good for smashing the glass.
Eventually, he found a rock bigger than a fist, and came back.
"You don\'t have to smash the whole thing.
 Just open it enough so that you can reach the lock."
"Don\'t get your hopes up, alright?"
Rudolf raised the rock, and hit the glass with it several times.
Before long, he succeeded in skillfully opening a hole big enough that he could unlock it from the outside.
...Covering his hand with a handkerchief, he stuck his hand through that hole, and cautiously unlocked it.
"We should probably cover it with duct tape later.
 The rain\'ll get blown in."
When he threw the window open, the wind and rain made the curtains dance around violently.
 He swiped the curtain to the side.
...They could see the parlor they knew well.
They were a little relieved.
 ......Because they had thought that maybe, the room would be filled with more bizarre magic circles,
 or possibly the traces of some creepy ritual.
In any event, they didn\'t want to hang around out in the rain,
 so the six of them—Krauss, Natsuhi, Eva, Hideyoshi, Rudolf, and Nanjo—entered the parlor as a group.
"......It seems...that nothing in particular is out of the ordinary..."
".........mmh—"
"Wh‐what has happened, Shannon...?!"
"Wait, wait, are you alright?!
 What happened to you?!"
"Blood, blood!!
 D‐D‐Doctor Nanjo, take a look at this!!"
"Hey, Shannon‐chan!
 Are you okay?!
 Answer me!"
"Y‐you mustn\'t shake her...
 I will examine her condition now..."
She had been in the shadow of a sofa, so they hadn\'t noticed her until they entered the room.
Shannon was lying on the floor, her chest stained bright‐red with blood......
"He~~y,
 Battleeer, where are yoooou?
 Look, look, Shannon\'s corpse has turned up, see~~~?
 I won\'t bully you anymore, so come out."
"......Hmmmm?
 Oh, there you are.
 What are you doing, holding your head in a place like that?"
".............................."
Battler had his head pressed to the table, and was clutching it with his hands...
 His pitiful figure made it plainly clear that he didn\'t want to see anything, didn\'t want to hear anything...
Had he heard {f:5:Beatrice}\'s sneering voice?
...Could he not hear, or was he pretending that he couldn\'t hear?
 In any event, it was clear that he had closed up his heart like a shell...
"Pu ku ku ku...
 ......I wonder if you have tormented him too much, Milady.
 After showing him that much and demanding a counterargument,
 I can understand why he wants to mope around."
"Hey, Battleerr.
 If you can\'t argue back, resign, would you?
 It\'s your turn.
 If you don\'t make some move or pass,
 or else give up, we won\'t get anywhere."
"..............................et."
"......Huh?
 What\'s that?
 I can\'t hear you?"
"I said BE QUIET!!
 Aaaah, shut up shut uuuuuuuuuup!!
 Witches? Magic?!
 Can\'t you just do what you want, I don\'t believe, I don\'t believe any of it,
 damn it damn it damn it damn it damn it!!"
"Don\'t talk to me, don\'t show me anything, go away, go away, go the hell away!!
 Get your goddamned annoying face AWAY FROM MEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!"
"........................!!!"
{f:5:Beatrice} instinctively winced at Battler\'s sudden rage.
"......E‐even if you say that, um...
 If you don\'t finish your turn, then my turn won\'t come.
 I feel like saying, don\'t make me too bored—"
"You think I give a crap, be quiet, SHUT UP!!
 I don\'t give a damn about your game,
 I can\'t take this bullshiiiiit!!
 If your turn won\'t come until mine is finished, then you can just wait for all stinking eternity, can\'t you!!"
"Aaaah, I don\'t care I don\'t care I don\'t get it!!
 I won\'t accept witches or magic, I won\'t accept something that fucked up!!
 Uuooooooooooohhh, I said DON\'T TALK TO MEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!"
......I don\'t know what\'s what anymore.
After being shown something that screwed up, how could I continue to resist...
I wandered aimlessly through the rose garden.
......It was raining and windy, but that didn\'t mean my body got wet.
 ...There was just a feeling of isolation as I wandered amidst the wind and rain without an umbrella.
"..................Maybe I...
lost to her game a long time ago."
...Actually, I wonder whether we hadn\'t reached a clear resolution in the previous game.
After all, I had submitted to her for a time.
So the world had been tinted with witches and magic.
......Right now, Rokkenjima is a different world, where witches stride around openly and fire off strange magic.
...It isn\'t a matter of accepting it or denying it.
Maybe I had mistakenly assumed that I was playing a game on an even footing with Beato.
I had already been defeated in the last game, ...and this may just be the signing ceremony of my surrender.
Just now, a mighty battle had unfolded in this rose garden.
I had seen it with my own eyes.
I kicked the ground.
 ......Obviously, the ground was hard.
And a puddle splashed.
Several towers had split this ground, sprouting like high‐rise buildings.
......The more I kicked this ground,
 .........the more it felt like that really couldn\'t be possible.
But, because of that, I couldn\'t explain it with anything other than magic anymore......
"......I get the locked rooms with the key shut up inside,
 they\'re probably just an extension of what you always see in detective novels.
 ......But, ......that stuff, though...
 All that big flashy stuff......
 Damn iiiiit........."
"...............It seems that my disciple has caused you much trouble."
"...Huh?
 .........It\'s you..."
I was suddenly spoken to, so I turned around,
 ...and in the rose garden arbor,
 ......was the Predecessor {f:5:Beatrice}, who {f:5:Beatrice} had supposedly defeated a short while ago.
".........I was sure you\'d died.
 So, you were alive."
"No, I died.
 ...Now, I am nothing more than a captured chess piece loitering outside the chessboard."
"You\'re Beato\'s master, right?
 So, in other words, you\'re a witch too."
"......Yes, that is correct."
"Tch.
 So, in other words,
 ......that means witches really do exist?
 And I\'m not the one who can defeat her.
 That\'d be you, since you can use awesome magic, wouldn\'t it?
 ...I\'m just useless now.
 There\'s nothing I can do anymore..."
"............Oh, my.
 Have you submitted completely?"
"What do you mean, submit?!
 How the crap should I explain that?!
 Towers sprouting and falling!!
 Huge giants holding shields and throwing spears!"
"Aaah, just remembering it makes me feel like I\'m going insane, reasoning isn\'t worth a damn anymore, is it?!!
 We\'ve left the level of tricks and explanations with human culprits!!
 Aaaaaaaaaaahh, shit shit shit shit!!"
"Calm yourself.
 ......I am nothing more than a piece on that child\'s game board.
 After being removed from that board, I am no longer a being who can do anything."
"But you are that child\'s opponent.
 As long as you do not give up by yourself, you will always have the power to strike back at that child."
"Shut up!
 Weren\'t you also reciting strange spells and summoning towers and spears?!!"
"What do you mean, strike back?!
 Are you saying you\'ll teach me magic too, telling me to fight her in one of those massive magic battles?!!"
"......If you wish,
 I could teach you a bit about magic."
"Oh, just what I wanted!
 Please, give me some awesome magic to smash her chest in one blow...!!
 Hah, don\'t screw with me!"
"I hear that in Japanese magic, there is a ceremony to pray for rain.
 Do you know of it?"
"Rain ceremony?
 That thing where you throw stuff into the fire and offer a dance?
 ......That\'s not magic.
 The fire causes a thermal, and as a result, rain clouds gather.
 I\'m pretty sure that\'s an accepted scientific phenomenon."
"Oh?
 ...I had believed that it was a form of eastern magic,
 but it isn\'t magic?
 I had believed that people offered sacred fire to the heavens, as well as a dance of respect,
 so that your entreaty for rain would reach the hearts of the gods."
"Maybe people did that long ago.
 But most occult things like that have a scientific explanation."
"Why do things burn?
 Isn\'t that because phlogiston is contained in the material?"
"......No, things burn because of an oxidation reaction.
 Lavoisier abolished the phlogiston theory."
"Why does heat transfer through objects?
 Isn\'t that because caloric is contained in the material?"
"......I\'m pretty sure that was abolished by Joule.
 Heat is energy, not a substance."
"You have studied well.
 Your knowledge is correct."
"...It\'s just some random facts."
"Phlogiston, caloric, and eventually ether and God\'s love.
 ......All are powerless before a scientific explanation.
 In the past, I was told that an apple falls from a tree...
thanks to God\'s love, so that humans would be given food."
"Even gravity was explained by God\'s love?
 ...Well, that\'s probably a leftover from a period when religion rather than science was used to explain everything."
"That is correct.
 In the past, humans called the limits of their knowledge...
...no, ignorance itself, "magic".
 ...Just like the rain ceremony we were just talking about."
"Did the people of ancient times...
understand the science of fire giving rise to heat to cause a thermal which calls forth clouds?
 Even without understanding, they at least knew of the result."
"......That probably happened a lot.
 The wisdom of ancestors.
 Even without understanding the reason, through long experience, they knew that they would obtain that result.
 ...Phenomena whose principles they didn\'t understand were probably the same as magic to them."
Just like this person had just said, ancient people who didn\'t understand the principles had probably believed that,
 through the rain ceremony, their wish had reached the heavens and made the rain fall.
To them, that was certainly magic.
As long as they didn\'t understand thermals...
"If you press a light switch, the light turns on.
 ......Children do not know the scientific principles behind why the lightbulb lights up;
 they press the switch knowing only the result.
 If they can obtain a result without knowing the principles, isn\'t that "magic" to them?"
"...............That\'s pretty interesting.
 ...Well, logically, that\'s true.
 ...For example, I don\'t have a clue why the Braun tubes in a TV show a picture."
"However, I think it\'s completely normal for things to be displayed on the TV.
 Even if I don\'t understand the principles behind Braun tubes, I at least know that "if I push the switch I can watch TV"."
"...It\'s exactly the same as having a rain ceremony without understanding thermals.
 ......In other words, if I don\'t know the principles, even TV is the same as "magic",
 no, could you say it is magic?"
"Do you know how Braun tubes are constructed?
 Have you ever taken one apart and looked inside?"
"......Nope.
 I think I read about it in a book or something once, but it was complicated and I didn\'t have a clue.
 I think that when electrons hit a fluorescent material, it creates luminescence or something like that..."
"That book was a fake.
 Actually, there are small people called gremlins shut up inside the Braun tubes,
 and they do their job with magic."
"Huh?!
 That\'s stupid, there\'s no way...!"
"How can you deny it if you have never looked inside a Braun tube?"
"......I\'ve never looked inside, but I can state with confidence that small people like that definitely don\'t exist!"
"Since there is no Braun tube here, that is impossible to prove."
"Y‐yeah, it is impossible to prove right this very moment,
 ...but later I can take apart a TV somewhere and show you, and instantly win the argument!"
"So, in other words,
 my "magic theory", that gremlins are shut up inside the Braun tubes and display the picture with magic,
 is impossible to disprove until we can verify the contents of a Braun tube, correct?"
".........Hmm,
 .........what the hell, one of those?
 Are you trying to say it\'s a "Devil\'s Proof"?
 That\'s your favorite trick, you witches."
"The "Devil\'s Proof" is sophistry exploiting the impossibility of proving a negative fact.
 However, it is different from what I am talking about with Braun tubes.
 That could be resolved just by taking apart a single television."
"......You\'re right.
 It really isn\'t a "Devil\'s Proof"."
"The scientific theory you propose, and the magical theory I propose.
 ...One of those is the truth.
 And which one it is can be ascertained as soon as you look inside the Braun tube.
 However, until the instant that happens, we cannot deny each other\'s theories."
"So, despite the fact that there is only one truth,
 until the moment you look into the Braun tube, two conflicting truths can exist at the same time.
 ......A bizarre space where two truths, of which only one is permitted to exist, may exist simultaneously."
Is the cat in the box alive or dead?
If you open the box, you will know the answer.
 You will know the truth.
However, until you open the box, you can claim that the cat is alive, and you can also claim it is dead.
Each of the two parties makes a claim that according to them is the "correct" truth,
 and even though the two sides are conflicting, neither can win the argument as long as the box remains unopened.
In other words, two truths can exist at the same time.
Even though there can only be one cat in the box,
 it is packed with a living cat and a dead cat, in a strange parallel world.
That is what Rokkenjima is now.
......This island is now a different world where a science theory and a magic theory exist at the same time.
...To a resident of the world of science such as yourself,
 at a glance, it may feel as though this island has been sucked into a world of magic.
While that may be correct, it is not accurate.
Strictly speaking, it has moved from the world of science, to the midway point between that world and the world of magic.
So at a glance, it appears to you as though the world is tilted towards the magic side.
......But actually, this island is now in a perfectly impartial position with relation to the two opposing worlds.
"......I don\'t really get it...
 Midway between reality and magic?
 A perfectly impartial world?
 How\'s that?
 Hasn\'t everything been going really bad for me the whole time...?!"
"Then perhaps you could think of it this way.
 This is a trial.
 Think of it as a court where you and {f:5:Beatrice} are laying out opposing claims.
 We could describe it as a Braun tube trial."
"That child claims that there are tiny people inside the Braun tubes.
 And she explains about the lives of the tiny people, what they look like,
 what type of magical power they have, on and on.
 ......And you?"
"......Well, I study in a library, and argue back by explaining how Braun tubes are constructed, I guess."
"At that moment, both your claim and that child\'s claim exist in the court at the same time.
 ......If you lend an ear to that child\'s claim,
 you may hear it as though it were the truth. See it as though it were the truth.
 That is precisely what you were shown."
"..........................."
"At this moment, on Rokkenjima, witches and magic certainly might exist as truth.
 ...However, that world is an uncertain wavefunction, existing only until the moment that the cat\'s box is opened.
 All states can be justified simultaneously.
 However, there is one truth."
"That is collapsed by observation,
 and countless truths are weeded out to become one truth.
 It is like when, in court,
 the judge makes his judgment.
 The two truths from the prosecutor\'s and the defense\'s claims...
collapse by the judgment, and become one."
".........So to say it in your words,
 ......this island right now is the world right before looking into the Braun tube, right...?
 Therefore, neither the science theory nor the magic theory can be denied.
 ...And since they cannot be denied—"
"Both can exist as truth.
 That is why both witches and magic can exist.
 ...However, at the same time, your opinion which denies them can also exist simultaneously as truth."
".........It is a world where two conflicting things can exist at the same time.
 And, it is a world where the conflicting truths cannot disprove each other.
 .........Is it starting to make sense to you...?"
"..................In other words...
...no matter how much awesome magic Beato shows me...
...that is only a claim from the "magic theory", and it doesn\'t disprove mine."
"So, it\'s like, "no matter what kind of magic Beato shows me,
 in this world, that cannot become proof that magic exists"."
"That\'s right.
 That child will probably even try to explain an apple falling from a tree with magic.
 That child might shake her staff and pluck the apple with magic,
 and claim that she dropped it to the earth."
"However, that would be nothing more than another one of her claims.
 None of her claims can block your opportunity to make a claim.
 ......In that sense, this world is quite "impartial" to both sides."
".........I...get it...
 ......Still.
 By that argument, even if I show a sound argument with my "science theory",
 all it will do is collide head‐on with her "magic theory", and I can\'t win against her either.
 Furthermore, there won\'t be any final judgment unless we peek into the Braun tube."
".........Where is the Braun tube in this world?
 ...It means there\'s no reason for us to argue.
 ......Wouldn\'t it be alright if we just got along and peeked into the Braun tube?"
"If there really is a tiny person in there, I suffer total defeat.
 Otherwise, I win.
 ......Why do we have to hold this debate without looking into the Braun tube?"
"That itself is the "game" which that child has challenged you to.
 Perhaps, instead of a court, I should use chess as an example.
 Victory and loss is not determined by a judge.
 You who are fighting will decide it yourselves."
"......Can you win an argument with an opponent in a screwed‐up world where multiple truths can exist at the same time?"
"But do you not realize, in point of fact, you were beaten in an argument, and are sitting here right now submitting...?"
"...............Heh.
 ...Heheheh."
"That is all the advice I can give you now.
 If you wish, I can occasionally give you advice."
"......Sure.
 Thanks, that really helps.
 ......I\'ll avenge you."
"Hoh‐hoh‐ho, thank you.
 I am looking forward to it."
"What\'s your name?"
"...{f:5:Beatrice} used to be my name, but now that I have surrendered it, I do not have a name."
".........So, I shall take a temporary name.
 ......{f:5:Virgilius}.
 ...No,
 what about {f:5:Virgilia}?"
"{f:5:Virgilia}.
 Valkyria?
 Wasn\'t that the name of a legendary goddess?"
"No.
 It means the one who is a guide to {f:5:Beatrice}.
 ......I will guide you to that child who waits at the summit of Mount Purgatory.
 It should be a fitting name for that kind of guide."
"To think that I\'d accept help from a witch when I\'m trying to deny witches.
 ......I see.
 If this is a contradictory world where different claims can exist at the same time, that also works.
 ...Ihihi, it\'s almost funny."
"I am borrowing that child\'s words, but you truly are like a phoenix.
 ......Your will to fight has already been revived."
"...Come, if your heart is prepared, return to that child,
 ......return to the chessboard that child is sitting at.
 ......I look forward to seeing how far you can fight my disciple."
"Yeah, you just watch.
 ............I won\'t listen to her babbling anymore.
 I\'ll coolly fight to the end.
 I definitely won\'t get provoked by her anymore."
"Then let us return.
 To the seat of the battle."
"...Oh, ......oooh, Battler...!
 Where did you hide yourself?
 *cackle*!
 I thought the sore loser wouldn\'t show himself again, you see?"
"......Sorry to keep you waiting.
 I\'ve cooled my head a little."
"Aaand?
 Did you think of a response to that pleasant, thrilling, refreshing, highly acclaimed, wonderful fantasy battle between Master and meeeeeeee?
 Isn\'t that impossible to explain without fantasy?
 Hihhyahhahahahahahahahahahahahaah?!"
"...Milady.
 You have only just promised to be kind and act refined, remember?"
"Ahhyahahahahaha, oops, my mistake.
 I just get in such a good mood when I see Battler\'s face, you see?
 C\'mon c\'mon c\'mon, c\'mon then Battler, that battle just now, how will you respond to it?
 Hmmmmmm?"
".................................
 ...Battle?
 Did something happen?"
"......Whaat?"
"Where in this rose garden.
 Where are all those spears and towers that you grew?
 Where have they all fallen to?
 ............They\'re not here, are they?
 ......In other words, this is what we see inside the Braun tube."
"......Inside the Braun tube, you say??
 *cackle*, what in the world are you talking about now...?"
"In this very moment,
 there is nothing at all in the rose garden.
 ...Sure, towers may have been sprouting with magic a short while ago.
 But that\'s only until we learn what\'s inside the Braun tube.
 ......It is your interpretation that it was a magical battle, and that\'s nothing more than a claim.
 And the fact that there\'s nothing at all here right now is the proof of that."
"This is how I argue back about that witch\'s battle just now:
 Right now, there isn\'t anything here, and that proves that nothing happened...!"
"..................
 ......Hahaha, hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐ha!
 You know, obviously I can\'t make a huge mess right on the first twilight, and I do like that rose garden, you see?
 To prevent any damage, I fought inside a barrier.
 So it\'s only natural that it wouldn\'t have any influence on reality."
"......That is your "claim"?
 Well, I guess that works."
"However!
 My claim that, at this point in time, there is nothing in the rose garden,
 and therefore there was no magic, has not been obstructed in any way!!"
"W‐wait, wait, can you deny my magic with that mess?!
 It is impossible to prove that magic "does not exist"!
 It\'s a "Devil\'s Proof"!!"
"The truth is this garden at this very moment!
 The instant you look inside, the tiny people inside the Braun tube will vanish.
 And there are no traces of magic here at all!
 So that battle between you witches did not take place!!"
"Wh‐
......what the,
 th‐that counter......?!
 That power,
 ...c‐could it be...?!"
"...Have you forgotten, Milady?
 It is the Multiplanar World Collapsation Technique.
 The power of a Finite Witch, which is the pair to the power of an Endless Witch.
 Only an Endless Witch would be able to understand it, and it causes the strongest effect for an Endless Witch."
"Sch‐‘Schrödinger\'s cat box’?!
 .........Th‐......that old hag of a witch...what an uncalled‐for hint!!"
"We\'ve lost time.
 With the five servants and Grandfather, there are six corpses!
 Let me check the scene.
 I\'ve been trudging along wasting time.
 From now on, I\'ll speed things up, okay?"
"Take a seat, {f:5:Beatrice}!!
 It\'s finally the first twilight, isn\'t it? Let\'s start the real thing.
 Show me what you\'ve got!!!"
