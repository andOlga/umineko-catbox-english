"...I see...
 So, not a witch, but a mistress by the name of {f:5:Beatrice} did exist on the island..."
"......So there can be more than 18 people!
 Which means I can defeat that line of reasoning which says that, if it was impossible for all 18 people, it must be a crime involving magic.
 ......That\'s some big information."
"Excuse me.
 Battler‐sama, would you care for some black tea and cookies?"
Beato\'s butler, who called himself Ronove, appeared out of nowhere in particular.
Placed upon the silver tray that he held was a plate filled with delicious‐looking, steaming black tea and cookies.
...I really don\'t like this guy\'s smile.
{n}For some reason, it doesn\'t look like a smile used to warmly greet a guest.
{n}It feels like he\'s making fun of me for some reason.
...I don\'t know whether he really takes me for an idiot,
 or whether it\'s just a joke or something, but it\'s really irritating me.
"......I don\'t want any.
 I\'m busy right now.
 Leave me alone."
"Oh, my.
 That is a shame, when the cookies have turned out oh so very delicious.
 Cooked so wonderfully it is a shame to waste them on a simple {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}, truly wonderful cookies."
"I\'ll eat some when I feel like it.
 Set it down somewhere over there and get out of here."
"Will that be acceptable?
 Then I shall do so.
 You may eat them when they get cold and stale, and then regret as much as you like that you did not eat them when they were freshly baked."
".........You really are annoying.
 ...Well, you\'re a lot better than that Beato, who keeps doing that creepy cackle right next to my ear."
"Oh, yes, yes, that is quite true.
 There are times when Milady\'s laughter becomes quite undignified.
 Every time I hear it, I think of my noble rank,
 and struggle to comprehend why I must have such a person as my master.
 Pu ku ku ku..."
"......Man you\'re weird.
 If you don\'t like it, then couldn\'t you just not work for her?"
"To continue serving despite that is furniture\'s joy.
 One could not serve as furniture without such an attitude."
"......Let us set that aside.
 How has the game been proceeding?
 Just now, I believe I heard you say that you had found some good information, and were quite pleased by it.
 Well now, I wonder what your shallow wit has thought up."
As Ronove made fun of me and giggled,
 he followed my earlier words to the letter and placed the black tea and cookies somewhere arbitrary nearby.
"......I imagine it is because you have gained increased confidence in the existence of a 19th person?
 Would you be gracious enough to allow me to hear your opinion?"
"..................
 ......Yeah, sure.
 I\'m just going to say it again in front of Beato anyway.
 No reason to hide it."
"......Alright.
 It looks like there\'s a hidden mansion somewhere on this island, and that Grandfather had his mistress living there.
 In that case, the question that\'s been torturing me, about whether there are 18 or 19 people, can be easily resolved."
"Although you deny witches,
 you hold a double standard by refusing to seek a culprit among the 18, and have driven yourself into a dead‐end."
"...The easiest way to deny the witch would be to doubt one of the 18.
 ......It\'s not so easy for every one of the 18 to have an alibi.
 You always find at least one person with a fragile alibi.
 ......I could probably continue to deny the witch forever if I just used that person as a sacrifice."
"However, I will steadfastly refuse to do that!!
 Yeah, that\'s no good, that\'s no goddamn good at all!
 Every one of those 18 people is either a parent, a relative or a cousin to me!
 And those reliable servants, who are sometimes serious and sometimes funny.
 I won\'t let myself use any one of them as a sacrifice!!"
"In the past, my resolve wavered.
 That\'s how Beato hit me where my heart was weak."
"......Accepting and understanding your own weaknesses.
 That is not something which can often be accomplished.
 Battler‐sama, you are using this theory about a 19th person as a spear.
 ...Or should I say, a shield?"
"In any event, unlike how unprepared you were in the games up until now,
 let us call the fact that you now have a compass bearing on how to fight...a dramatic leap forward.
 With this, you need not doubt any of the 18 you love and respect,
 and can easily suspect a 19th person, and pursue your theory that the culprit is a human."
"That\'s it exactly.
 Like in the first game, when Kanon‐kun was killed in the boiler room,
 ...and a bunch of other places,
 there are countless tricks I can use without hesitation if a 19th person existed."
In the very first game, Kanon‐kun had been killed in the boiler room.
One might think that he was attacked by Kumasawa‐san, who had gone down into the boiler room with him,
 or maybe that someone who had appeared to be dead earlier was actually faking,
 and had ambushed Kanon‐kun in the boiler room.
 Either way, it was a move that forced me to suspect one of the 18.
However, by simply proposing that a 19th person exists,
 there\'s no longer any need to suspect one of the 18 for that murder in the boiler room.
"In short!
 "Impossible for any of the 18 = The culprit is a witch"...
 is an equation that I can now deny."
Using this argument, we can take, for example, the question which has been raised once again in this game,
 "who gave Maria the letter?",
 and come up with an easy explanation.
 Even if all 18 people have alibis,
 I can easily explain everything by saying that a 19th person visited her and gave her the letter.
".........Hmm, hmm.
 I think that is quite a good move.
 How would I strike back?"
"......Battler‐sama, despite your understanding, there are still plenty of weak points.
 Perhaps the "18 people attack" will be an effective move.
 As an attempt to judge how strong your defense is, it may be interesting to attack from that angle again."
"Then how would you do it,
 demon butler...?!"
"......I believe it would be appropriate to attack this 19th piece that you have played.
 Battler‐sama, have you ever met this 19th person?
 May I ask you for some proof that this 19th person exists?"
"How naive.
 Of course, I knew you\'d probably try that move...!"
"My, my.
 Please respond to it."
"Witches and demons and the like...
 There\'s no move more appropriate for you than this one.
 ......And that is—"
"The "Devil\'s Proof"!"
When we humans are accused of something, we always counterattack by saying to show some evidence.
 Because that\'s a human move.
But I\'m fighting with a witch.
{n}I\'m taking part in a battle with someone who isn\'t human!
And some moves exist which can only be used in a game against a witch.
{n}There are cheap moves!
And that\'s what this "Devil\'s Proof" is.
{n}Therefore, evidence is unnecessary!
Let\'s take the assumption that there is a hidden mansion on Rokkenjima separate from the Ushiromiya family mansion,
 and that a woman named {f:5:Beatrice} is living there.
In order to prove this, one must find this mansion and actually bring {f:5:Beatrice} out of it.
That\'s called actual proof in the human world.
However, if we follow the rules of the "Devil\'s Proof", you can\'t disprove that she exists, even if there\'s no evidence that she does.
Because it\'s impossible to prove that something doesn\'t exist.
......That\'s right, this "Devil\'s Proof", which tormented me so much before, I\'ve finally managed to use to my own advantage.
Those guys were always trying to force me to accept the existence of the witch by using the "Devil\'s Proof".
That was because, in response to Beato\'s professions that witches do exist,
 I physically could not offer any proof that "witches don\'t exist".
That is why I have been subjected to this nonsense that witches exist, and why I have been unable to counterattack.
And that\'s why I\'ll flip over the chessboard right now!
If I can\'t disprove that witches exist, then that means,
 if I suggest that a 19th human exists, you can\'t disprove that either.
In other words, the enigmatic mistress in question is craftily hiding herself, so it\'s perfectly natural that you can never find her no matter how hard you look.
So you can\'t say that "The 19th person can\'t be found = The 19th person doesn\'t exist".
Therefore, it is impossible to disprove a 19th person.
{n}Beato used the "Devil\'s Proof" to make denying her existence impossible,
 but this time it\'s become my weapon.
If we can get away with this argument, then never mind a 19th person,
 this island could be full of people we don\'t know about,
 and even if there are ten or a hundred of them hiding, she still can\'t disprove that they exist.
In the last game and the one before that, among the murder scenes that showed up, there were several that were extremely intricate and must have taken a lot of effort to set up.
It\'s very difficult to imagine that a single culprit could have set all of those up.
However, if not just a 19th person, but ten or a hundred people were hidden somewhere, that wouldn\'t be any problem at all.
If they all split up the work, they could handle any job in a short period of time.
Of course, doubts will naturally arise at whether a large group of people like that could sneak around the mansion without being noticed,
 but those are all settled by the "Devil\'s Proof".
Because not seeing or not noticing a hundred people inside the mansion does not disprove that they were there.
Even though I\'m saying it myself, it\'s such a stupid argument that it makes me wanna throw up!
 However, it\'s because it\'s such a dirty‐as‐hell move that makes it the perfect one to use against a witch.
Well, we\'re only imagining here,
 ...but the thought of about a hundred suspicious men wearing goat masks hiding in the shadows......
 That goes beyond "funny", makes me think of cockroaches.
If you see one, it means there\'s a hundred hiding in the shadows.
"......Well, I do think this is a ridiculous argument that\'s horribly twisted.
 If my opponent was human, I\'m sure they\'d yell at me like I was out of my mind."
"......But my opponent is a witch.
 And after all, that is the kind of competition we\'re having, isn\'t it?
 I\'ll use any kind of reckless argument to explain it using humans, and deny the witch!!"
"......Anyway, with this move, I\'ll never again have to doubt any of the 18 who are close to me.
 I will never again repeat the defeat I suffered last time...!!"
"......I see.
 You have learned from your defeat last time.
 That is good.
 It is no surprise that by the third game you have become quite devious."
".........You first strengthen your own defense.
 That is truly a solid first step.
 Quite a spectacular move, I think."
"Well, even if we do assume that there is a 19th person,
 there are still a few tricks left that I can\'t get past no matter how many humans I add, like the number of master keys.
 ...Still, it isn\'t bad as a first step, for the time being."
"This is your trump card, the important piece known as the 19th person.
 ......You countered my move of asking for evidence by using the "Devil\'s Proof".
 ......A good skirmish."
"Although I have no excuse for making moves by myself when Milady is absent,
 .........I find that I too have become slightly interested.
 ...I wonder if you would permit me to make yet another move on Milady\'s behalf?"
"......Go for it.
 I don\'t care if you\'re a witch or a demon, I\'ll take you all on!"
"The move that you made, the "Devil\'s Proof".
 It is a specialty of us demons, but there are also various other moves available to us.
 ......Do you know of a move called "Hempel\'s Raven"?"
"Hempel\'s Raven...??
 What are you talking about?"
"...*cackle*cackle*.
 Ah‐ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hah‐ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hah‐hah‐ha...!"
Just then, ...aah, that laugh, which gets on my nerves every time I hear it, started echoing around.
The room was filled with dazzling golden butterflies, and in the center of that whirlwind, the Golden Witch appeared.
"Why, if it isn\'t Milady.
 Good morning."
"I thought you might be doing something interesting while I was away."
"......‘Hempel\'s Raven’, was it?
 What an amusing and nostalgic move.
 To think the day would come when it would be introduced to Battler.
 It\'s a classic move to use against the "Devil\'s Proof"."
"......Ronove, I will make this move.
 Do not get in the way of my fun."
"So you\'ve finally shown up, you guffawing witch.
 I see you still have that undignified laugh.
 ......This guy was talking behind your back just now, telling me about how your laughing lacks class.
 Right?"
"I am offended.
 Is that true?"
"By no means.
 I have only words of the highest heartfelt respect for Milady;
 why would I speak such gossip?"
"...I can\'t believe you can say that so brazenly.
 Doesn\'t look like we\'ll be getting along well together..."
"*cackle*cackle*cackle*.
 Well, that is fine.
 Let us return to the conversation.
 "Hempel\'s Raven" is used to show proof using the contrapositive."
"......Essentially, it is a move like this:
 What must you do to prove that ravens are black?"
"Huh?
 What are you talking about??
 Prove that ravens are black...
 ...Wouldn\'t you just have to catch the ravens and check to see if they\'re black?"
"That is right.
 You must simply prove that "if it is a raven, it is black".
 And do you see that, if you prove that "if a bird is not black, it is not a raven", you would reach the same argument?"
"If you go throughout the world and examine all birds that are not ravens, and prove that none of them are black,
 then as a result, you can claim that "therefore, birds that are black are ravens".
 This is called an argument by the contrapositive.
 ...Is that difficult for you?"
"Yeah, no kidding.
 ...I have no idea what you\'re saying."
"Battler‐sama.
 What about this example?
 Let us say that you have two boxes, and one of them is the winner, with a cookie inside.
 Of course, the other one is the loser, and is empty."
For example, let us say that we have two boxes here,
 one being the winner with a cookie inside, and the other being the loser, which is empty.
Now, it holds that "if there is a cookie inside, it is the winner",
 and at the same time, it also holds that "if it is not the winner, there is no cookie inside".
When such a relationship exists, we call the latter the contrapositive...
When "if A then B" is true, then at the same time, "if not B then not A" is also true.
"...Well, that\'s obvious.
 If the one you picked was the loser, then you would automatically know that the other one was the winner."
"...In other words, if you choose the box at random, whether it\'s the winner or the loser,
 you\'ll be able to figure out which box has the cookie in it after your first move."
"That is correct.
 If the cookie is in the box you open, then the "Devil\'s Proof" is satisfied.
 You can prove directly that "this box is the winner = this box has a cookie in it"."
"However, if the box that you open is empty, then the reverse, "Hempel\'s Raven", is satisfied.
 Because then, it holds that "this box does not have a cookie in it = this box is not the winner"."
"And that means, as long as we accept the premise that there are no more than two boxes,
 the contrapositive shows that the other box is automatically the winner."
"......Well, I think I\'m starting to see your reasoning.
 Only poison can stop poison, and only twisted logic can stop twisted logic."
"...Then what?
 How does that overturn my claim that "no doubt there is a 19th human hidden on this island,
 so even if all of the 18 people have alibis,
 that does not amount to an acceptance of witches"......?"
"Very well.
 I will tell you my move.
 First of all, you are stating that "if the culprit is not among the 18, then the culprit is a 19th person"."
"*cackle*cackle*!
 ...So if you use the contrapositive, it ends up like this.
 In short, "if the culprit is not a 19th person, then the culprit is one of the 18"!"
"Whaah?!
 What the, what does that mean?!"
"All I have done is turn your move on its head.
 It shouldn\'t be that difficult to understand.
 Ronove, explain.
 It seems your cookie‐in‐a‐box analogy from before will be easy for Battler to understand."
"Then forgive my presumption.
 Allow me to explain using my earlier example once more."
Allow me to repeat once more my earlier story,
 about two treasure chests, one of which has a cookie in it.
In this situation, one of the boxes represents "the 18 people", and the other box represents "the 19th person".
So the cookie would represent the "culprit".
Battler‐sama, you open the 18 box.
{n}Because the cookie is not there,
 you have proven from the opposite direction that "therefore, the cookie is in the 19 box".
In that case, if we reverse things further, we can also say the following.
Namely, if it was first shown that the 19 box was empty,
 it would prove in just the same way that "the cookie is in the 18 box".
Battler‐sama, this move you played in order to avoid having to doubt any of the 18,
 has in fact been used against you to launch the "18 person attack"...!"
"......Huh,
 ......what did you say........."
"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!
 If I go first and prove that the inside of the 19 box is empty,
 automatically,
 you will be forced to accept that the cookie is in the 18 box.
 All you have done is say this the other way around, you see?"
"So, ......that move that I was so confident in, ...was actually a double‐edged sword?"
"That\'s right.
 Your move to explain everything with a 19th person carries the risk that, if it is thwarted,
 you will be forced to accept that you can only explain things by using the 18."
I see...
 "Hempel\'s Raven".
{n}......So this is a countering technique?!
...Wait, if I really think about it, this countering technique is far more disadvantageous for me than for her.
The problem is in thinking about it like a cookie.
{n}If I imagine that just one of the treasure chests is a "losing" chest with a bomb in it, I can begin to understand it quite well.
And if I think of it not as two treasure chests,
 but as 18, one for each person, plus one more for the 19th person,
 for a total of 19 boxes, it gets even easier to understand.
First of all, one of the premises established by the human culprit theory was that the bomb would definitely be in one of those boxes.
Because I hadn\'t wanted to place that bomb in any of the 18\'s boxes, I had used the "Devil\'s Proof",
 and created the 19th box so that I could throw the bomb in there.
 ......That much was alright.
But Beato had struck back like this:
If, then, the 19th box was empty inside,
 that would automatically mean that the bomb was set in one of the other 18 boxes.
If I could examine the contents of each of the 18\'s boxes,
 and show that the bomb was not in any one of those boxes,
 I would be able to safely show that the 18 people were innocent.
If that was possible, I would be feeling confident!
However, in reality, that\'s as close as you can get to impossible.
The police wouldn\'t come here in this typhoon.
{n}There would be no scientific investigations, no autopsies, no nothing.
{n}In short, I can\'t show anything decisively!
It\'s impossible for me to find any proof other than simply gulping down whatever alibis each of the 18 give.
In that case, I have to confirm their innocence both personally and perfectly.
Like staying with someone the whole time, never letting them out of my sight for a second.
If I do that, I can probably be sure of that person\'s innocence,
 and that the bomb is not in that box.
...However, in reality, something like that is impossible!
{n}In other words, I have to expend an incredible effort just to check the contents of one box.
And there are 18 of them!
 In other words, unless I bind all 18 of them in chains and watch over them,
 it\'s impossible to prove that all of them have empty boxes.
However, Beato only has to open one box, the 19th box,
 and show that it is empty, to prove that the bomb is in one of the other 18 boxes.
 (Furthermore, there\'s no need for her to show {i:which} of the 18 boxes has the bomb!)
I have 18 times more work to do to explain my pet theory than Beato does for hers......
"Just as you know from the "Devil\'s Proof",
 there are many cases in this world where refuting something would take a vast amount of effort that is impossible in practice."
"However, "Hempel\'s Raven" turns that problem around, and makes it possible to prove things easily!"
"By using "Hempel\'s Raven", various reckless arguments become possible to prove."
"......For example, let us say that I make the proposition "All humans except me are foolish".
 Normally, in order to prove this, I would have to examine all of humanity except myself and show that they are all foolish."
"...However, in reality, it would be impossible to investigate billions of people.
 It is exactly the same kind of effort you would need to open all 18 boxes."
"*cackle*cackle*!
 However, by using "Hempel\'s Raven", the contrapositive of that proposition would change it as follows."
"Essentially, take this "All humans except me are foolish", and to use your style of phrase,
 flip over the chessboard, and you merely need prove that "not foolish = me".
 ......And what do you think that means?"
"*cackle*cackle*!
 As soon as I know the fact that "I am wise",
 I finish proving in an instant that every one of the billions of people in the human race is foolish.
 In less than a second, I can finish proving that the entire human race is more foolish than me!!"
"It\'s the strongest and fastest QED in the world.
 This...
is "Hempel\'s Raven"!"
"Wha‐.........what a ridiculous argument.........!!!"
"It is a very, very convenient move.
 Not only demons, but gods also use it.
 When you propose "blessed = God\'s servant",
 the contrapositive is "if a human is not a servant of God, then he must not be blessed"."
"So in order for servants of God to prove that they are granted fortune by their divine protection,
 they only have to prove that those who don\'t receive that divine protection suffer misfortune."
".........Therefore,
 by bringing misfortune down upon those people who don\'t believe in their own god, they prove their own blessedness."
"It takes an enormous cost to give humans happiness.
 ...However, the necessary cost to bring humans misfortune is much cheaper."
"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*.
 So by using "Hempel\'s Raven", gods can actually give believers the joy of divine protection at the lowest cost."
"Y‐......you demon.
 It\'s a demon\'s argument...
 ...That\'s messed up...!!!"
"It seems that we\'ve gone off‐topic.
 Let us return to it."
"I have finished describing the move for my counterattack.
 ......The counterattack to your claim that "a 19th person is the culprit; therefore, the 18 are innocent and the witch doesn\'t exist" is:
 "In that case, if I can prove that the culprit is not some 19th person,
 do we agree that the culprit must either be one of the 18, or a witch?".
 I await your answer."
For a while, I just stood there, shocked, completely forgetting to close my mouth...
Just when I\'d thought that I\'d got my own back on them by using their favorite move against them,
 the counterattack to that had been this reckless argument that I could not even have begun to imagine...!
Was it really...impossible...?!
To continue denying the witch on an island with no more than 18 people,
 and yet still believe in the innocence of those 18 people...
 .........Was that just a delusion?!
 Was I just trying to escape reality?!
Not yet...
 ......Don\'t give up this struggle yet.
Who cares about "Whoever\'s Raven"?
{n}They\'re just trying to speak in riddles by bringing up some weird bits of trivia...
I had used the "Devil\'s Proof".
{n}Don\'t feel doubt in something once you\'ve used it.
{n}Believe in the spear you\'ve lunged forward with.
Apply even more force......and gouge it in......!
"......The game is still in the opening.
 Do you already intend to spend this long thinking?"
"........................
 Ah,
 ......wait a sec,
 I want to be sure."
"While yes, I did use the phrasing of a "19th person" to make it easy to understand,
 if I can use the "Devil\'s Proof" to raise the number of people above 18,
 then what I mean is an unspecified large number of extra people—you don\'t know if it\'s ten or a hundred."
"{i:Always one more than you assume}.
 ...Understand?"
She had returned my twisted logic with something even more twisted.
{n}So the only thing that could counter that would be even crazier twisted logic...!
"Hmm, I see.
 .........Even if I somehow prove an alibi for the 19th person,
 as soon as I do, you will think up a 20th person, and claim that they are the culprit.
 By repeating this infinitely, you would make it so I kept searching for their alibis for all eternity."
"......I see, I see, *cackle*cackle*!
 Just like a demon king summoning a plague of locusts.
 I wouldn\'t expect anything less from Kinzo\'s grandchild.
 It looks like you have been gifted with a talent in summoning."
"......In short!
 It is impossible to continually prove an alibi for the "X" existing outside of the first 18!
 ......How do you like that, Beato...?!
 Now that I know we\'re having a battle with twisted logic, I won\'t lose!"
"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!
 How foolish...
 Who do you think I am?
 I am the Endless Witch, the Infinite Witch!
 For you to challenge me at infinity is absurd.
 Having control over infinity means also that I am able to kill infinity."
"......When your 19th person folds, you will call a 20th,
 and when your 20th person folds, you will call a 21st,
 and when your 21st person folds and your 22nd person folds,
 you will call a 23rd, a 34th, a 64358223579673204th,
 you think you can trifle with me for all eternity?!"
"I laugh at "infinite regress",
 the {i:infinite} doesn\'t affect me!!"
"Hoh, well then, how will you kill my "infinity"? Just try and show me!!"
"
{p:1:I have the power to speak the truth in red}!!!"
".....................!!
 .........Here it comes............"
"When I speak in red, it contains absolutely no illusions.
 If I say once in red that there are no more than 100 people on this island,
 you will no longer be permitted to create a 101st person."
"*cackle*cackle*!
 Come now, Battlerrr.
 What truth shall I tell in red this time?
 Where shall I strike for the kill and force you into hopelessness?
 *cackle*cackle*cackle*!
 Come, show me your usual frightened face......"
".............................."
"..................What?"
"......Ihihihihi."
"...Why...are you laughing...?"
I wonder what kind of creepy look I had on my face as I laughed right then.
{n}That red sure is scary.
 ...Every time it jumps out, I\'m driven into the depths of hopelessness.
But......I had already realized it.
{n}...There was no need to be unnecessarily afraid of the red.
".........You\'ve brought out your secret weapon again.
 So...?
 What and how will the great {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama speak in red this time?"
"......Hoh.
 What do you mean by this?
 Suddenly looking so relaxed..."
"Sorry, but I\'ve been waiting for you to take out that blood‐red treasured sword.
 ......Let\'s see, what will you proclaim in red this time?"
"You aren\'t going to say "the culprit was one of the 18", are you?
 Let me warn you, that would be self‐destruction, remember?
 That would be the same as throwing away your own witch theory yourself.
 A complete resignation."
That\'s right.
 The red isn\'t always necessarily to Beato\'s advantage.
 On the contrary, if she used it the wrong way, it\'s dangerous enough that she could bring about her own death.
 If she used it carelessly and said something which ended up denying herself, that would be exactly the same thing as self‐destructing.
"Of course,
 it would also be sad and difficult for me to accept if you told me in red that one of the 18 was the culprit.
 ......No matter who the culprit actually was, it would surely bring me some tough emotions..."
"But before that, it would mean your defeat!
 Saying in red that the culprit is a human is equivalent to your proclamation of resignation!!
 If you want to strike me a blow so badly you\'re prepared to die at the same time, I think that\'s a pretty interesting move.
 However, this battle will end in my victory!!"
{f:5:Beatrice}\'s red was truly her secret weapon, her treasured blade.
 The things she spoke in red would become solidified as the truth, and no amount of evidence or counterarguments could change them.
They had cut me down to size many times now, rending in two any supports my heart had to lean on.
However, if she used it carelessly, then I could also find a little information about the truth.
...In the last game, especially during the chapel\'s locked room trick, I had taken advantage of that,
 and had once closed her in almost completely.
But she was also pretty sly.
 She had learned from experience, and since then, had started using discretion in the timing of the red...
This feeling of tension was almost literally like a battle with real swords.
...This was a battle of high intelligence.
{n}......No, not of intelligence.
{n}It really was twisted logic.
This was the world\'s craziest and worst battle of twisted logic...!!
"So, now it\'s your move.
 ......That\'s right.
 To use your "Hempel\'s Raven",
 first, you\'ll have to confirm in red how many humans there are other than the 18."
"And after that, if you proclaim in red that none of the people in that group are the culprit,
 ......that\'s right, that might be a fatal wound to me."
".........I\'m surprised that you no longer have even an atom of fear for that red which you feared so much...
 You\'re quite sturdy."
"Unsheathe it.
 Your treasured blade.
 ......A single perfect swing, and you might be able to break me this time, who knows...?"
"......*cackle*cackle*cackle*.
 ...Interesting.
 I wouldn\'t have it any other way..."
Agitate her.
 Provoke her.
{n}Drive her into a corner to make her speak in red...
Of course her red has always cut right through my only threads of hope.
 But......don\'t be afraid of that.
On this island overcome with falsehoods and illusions, the only thing I can trust...
is the information that she speaks in red.
It is my only way across the chasm of Hell.
 Just a single tightrope.
Her merciless blood‐red blade is the only way I can survive.
...This isn\'t just walking on a tightrope, it\'s literally like walking on the edge of a blade...
Of course I\'m afraid.
 In terms of her contrapositive, my victory condition—the denial of the witch—meant that the culprit was a human.
But I didn\'t want to search for the culprit amid the 18.
...Therefore, I held on to a weak point, since I had to deny the witch and the 18 at the same time.
 Since I had been unable to understand that last time, that was where she had hit me, leaving me tattered and defeated.
......But that\'s alright.
{n}Let her hit me.
 Let her attack.
 No problem...
Someone said it once in an old sword‐fighting movie.
{n}That "a good fortress has one, and only one, intentionally weak point".
The enemy would gather there.
 They would be lured there.
{n}And that would be where the actual battle took place.
...As long as I understand my weak points,
 and as long as she wants to attack those weak points,
 ......it\'s as if I\'ve induced her to attack there...
Carefully judge the distance from your enemy, ...and retreat step by step.
 Make them draw their sword first.
The more she recklessly flourishes that red, the more chances I\'ll have to strike back.
Don\'t be afraid of the red.
{n}Keep the pressure on, so that she is forced to refute with the red......!
No matter how oppressively she speaks in red,
 ......yes, that red itself is the same as fresh blood spurting from her wounds.
"Come on.
 ...What\'s wrong?
 ......First of all, why don\'t you tell me in red how many people are on this island total?
 If you don\'t, your raven can\'t cut me up......!"
".....................Hmph.
 ...How surprising that you can be this desperate and yet this difficult.
 ...One cannot make light of someone putting their life on the line, no matter what the era."
"......It\'s no surprise you\'re Kinzo\'s grandchild.
 The more cornered you are,
 ............the bolder you become!"
"...Ihihihi..."
Ronove cleared his throat.
"You appear to be at a standstill.
 That black tea I worked so hard to make is getting cold,
 Milady."
".........kh."
Ronove, who was supposed to be her ally, roguishly rushed her next move.
Beato smiled back, probably intending to demonstrate that she was still relaxed, ......but she couldn\'t hide the sweat building up on her forehead.
By now she had completely lost that relaxedness which had allowed her to turn her nose up at her worthless opponent.
Of course, she probably wasn\'t really cornered by something like this.
 ...She was just...being cautious.
Until now, I had been inexperienced.
{n}I didn\'t have a good grasp on how to fight, and I was underpowered as an opponent.
However, now that we had reached the third game, she realized that I was starting to become skilled,
 and she had grown more cautious, thinking every move over carefully......
Sure, that\'s just fine, {f:5:Beatrice}.
{n}And sorry to have kept you waiting.
{n}Are you happy now...?
"......Now things are starting to get interesting, right......?
 Hihihihi!"
"*cackle*cackle*cackle*!
 ...Battleeeeerrrrr......"
"This isn\'t going anywhere...
 Then, should I just dive right in and go with the usual?"
"......Hoh.
 The usual, you say.
 ...Then by all means.
 If I don\'t hear that, I guess I just won\'t get the sense that we\'ve started..."
The first move was mine......
"Here I come, Beato."
"Repetition requested.
 ......‘There are only 18 people on this island’."
"....................."
"...If I hear you say this in red, I will have no choice but to doubt one of the 18.
 ......Since it could no longer be the work of a 19th person, all doors will be closed to me."
".........But I believe that the culprit is definitely not one of the 18!
 There\'s no way that any of those 18 could commit such brutal murders...!!"
"....................."
"I\'ll say it again.
 Repetition requested!
 "There are only 18 people on this island"."
"..............................
 .........I decline.
 I won\'t say why."
Whew...!
 I had avoided what would have been the worst red for me.
If she had repeated that,
 I would have been faced with those two worst choices of accepting the witch or suspecting one of the 18,
 like last time all over again...
But Beato had not proclaimed my ultimate and greatest weakness in red.
She had declined to repeat it—even though there was no reason why she shouldn\'t have struck—even though it was a weakness she should have been drooling at.
She hadn\'t sliced me up with red by using that move, which should have been as good as forking a rook and the king...!
......This was a big sign of my advantage.
That\'s right.
 The culprit isn\'t one of the 18 people.
{n}I won\'t doubt anyone...!
And since the culprit isn\'t a witch either,
 .........it means that a 19th person exists on this island.
And that\'s you.
A person who, as Grandfather\'s mistress of thirty years,
 has been living secretly in a hidden mansion in the forest for a long, long time.
The {i:human} {f:5:Beatrice}.........!!
"That\'s right.
 You aren\'t a witch or anything like it.
 ......You\'re just a human...who\'s been living on this island in hiding for several decades...!"
".........*cackle*cackle*.
 *cackle*cackle*cackle*...
 ...Did you just call me, the Endless Witch who has lived for over one thousand years, a mere human?
 ......*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!"
For a while, {f:5:Beatrice} continued to laugh unpleasantly, gloating or maybe spiteful.
"...Are you ready? I\'ll keep going.
 ...Again, repetition requested."
"‘There are at least 19 people on this island’!"
".............................."
{f:5:Beatrice} fell silent once again.
The feeling that confirming the number of humans on this island...
might possibly stand to give her some large disadvantage,
 was probably making her extremely cautious.
The red had already become a foothold for my counterattack.
 With that in mind, the red had become a risk for the witch.
But if she couldn\'t repeat this, her "Hempel\'s Raven" wouldn\'t work.
In order to break my "Devil\'s Proof",
 first, the existence of and number of people outside the 18...
needed to be confirmed in red.
That\'s right.
 She couldn\'t break the existence of a 19th person unless she used red.
I had {i:closed Beato in}, giving her no choice but to speak in red...!
There really was...
.........a way to fight,
 ......in this witch\'s game!
"It\'s alright to decline.
 ...If you can\'t say it in red, then that will mean the total number of people on this island will be 18+X."
"......That X is a pretty huge piece to allow me to have on the first move, isn\'t it?
 After all, from then on, all of the tricks with the basis "it was impossible for any of the 18"...
will become explainable with a human X outside of the 18 people.
 ......This is a huge piece that can break open any locked room hinging on everyone having an alibi...!"
It was just like...
a bishop in chess, which can cut a thin line through enemy forces as long as there\'s a slight gap.
 It only exerts an effect over squares of the same color, but it has a great ability to control the board.
"..............................
 ..................kh."
It looked like Beato also well understood her current plight.
She couldn\'t just let such an important piece go, especially this close to the beginning of the game...
If she pulled out her red treasured sword, it wouldn\'t be that difficult to save that piece.
......But Beato was completely aware that I was expecting it.
 She was afraid that a careless red truth might end up strangling her own neck...!
Because, ...in the first place, a witch was something which should be {i:denied} in red.
Believe.
 Don\'t doubt!
 Witches don\'t exist!
{n}Something like that can\'t exist in this world.
They can only exist in the cracks in reality.
...They are a fragile existence, curled up in these cracks, frantically trying to protect themselves from the brutal winds of truth,
 and they can only barely exist like a mirage by surviving on falsehoods and fantasy.
In other words, the red, which only witches can use, is the very reality by which they risk denying themselves.
......The more they brandish their red words...
the more they begin to lose, bit by bit, that crack in reality inside which they can endure.
That is why they don\'t want, through the red,
 ......to carelessly lose that crack in reality which is based on fuzzy information, or in other words, fantasy.
Because they understand that they would be gradually cornering themselves.
Of course, she would never admit it.
Because, if she did,
 it would be the same as admitting that she is something that can\'t exist in this world, like an imaginary number.
Don\'t be afraid.
 Stay strong...!
{n}She knows this deep down, and better than anyone.
That her red treasured sword can\'t easily be used without considerable resolve...!
"...What\'s wrong.
 I\'ll say it again.
 ......Repetition requested!"
"‘There are at least 19 people on this island’!"
"........................
 ......Hmh.
 ...I decline."
At the end of a long, long time spent deliberating,
 ......letting a single deep breath escape, she quietly proclaimed her refusal.
......I had thought that she\'d use it.
But Beato refused to speak in red, even though it would cost her victory in the opening part of the game.
"You declined, yes......?
 Which means that, from now on,
 I can create as many fictional character Xs outside of the 18 as I want...?"
"Do as you wish.
 ...I have declined your repetition.
 Isn\'t that enough for now?
 ......The reason I declined was...
......
 ...No, I will not reveal that for now.
 You will know soon in any case."
"...Ihihi.
 Still acting tough, I see..."
"......Red that I deliberately don\'t use is in itself a fitting use of red.
 You called it my red treasured sword.
 A pleasant analogy.
 I will use it too.
 ......A treasured sword is at its best when it is sheathed.
 In fact, there are times it can instill even more fear because it is sheathed."
"That\'s right.
 ...As I fight, I always have to keep in mind when you might turn everything over with those red words.
 It\'s some pretty serious pressure."
"......And there are times when having a repetition declined makes things harder for me.
 ...Those times, I can\'t tell whether you can\'t repeat because my guess was right,
 or whether you\'re just misleading me and letting me think whatever I want."
"...In that sense, yes, I see.
 A sheathed treasured sword."
"............What does it matter?
 If I\'m going to push you off a cliff anyway, I might as well let you climb a little higher first.
 ...We have still barely begun.
 Much is left to come..."
"I\'ll resign from this challenge.
 ...Go and get drunk on your faint victory for now.
 ......Only for now."
That bitter comment did, in fact, appear to have marked the end of the game\'s opening battle.
 Even so, I couldn\'t relax my guard at all.
...I was unable to relax my feeling of tension until I was greeted by the sound of Ronove\'s applause...
"......Spectacular, Battler‐sama.
 I suppose we could say that this game has started with at least the opening unfolding to your advantage?"
"No idea...
 I still don\'t know whether this piece was something I tore from her with my own hands,
 or whether she guided me into taking it."
"......After all, knowing you...
you probably know that I\'m being led into a trap, and that clapping is just a barefaced lie, right...?"
"How could you think that?
 I am innocently celebrating your ability that has enabled you to take one shot at Milady, though granted it is only the opening.
 ...After all, Milady is a person who is quick to become arrogant.
 I believe that a little stimulation such as that makes for a good medicine every once in a while."
"...This butler of yours sure has a vicious tongue..."
"Isn\'t that so?
 Sometimes he enrages even me."
"My, my, how incredibly rude of me."
"Well then, Milady, Battler‐sama.
 Would you care for some more black tea?
 The game has still barely begun.
 Please leave any tea or pastries that might adorn this game to me.
 Please, do not hesitate to advance further in the game."
"I will.
 Let\'s move forward.
 Now is when it really starts."
"............Hmph.
 Very well.
 Let us advance the clock.
 Ronove, black tea, please."
"Certainly.
 What about a cookie?"
"No need.
 Give it to Beelzebub to keep her happy.
 ............Remain silent for now."
While listening to the sound of the demon butler pouring tea, the witch closed her eyes slightly and fell into silence.
......For some time, she was deeply lost in thought, but eventually a roguish glint came into her eyes.
"Very well.
 ............Why don\'t I inform you now why I declined to speak in red for the first move."
"......What...?
 Bring it on.
 Show me what you\'ve got."
"*cackle*cackle*...
 It really is a big piece that you\'d hate to miss."
"......It may be hasty, but allow me to move.
 I won\'t use red, but from here on, Rosa will explain on my behalf.
 Listen."
"Of course, I agree as well.
 You too, right, Rosa?
 ...............Rosa?"
"Huh, ah, sorry...
 M‐me too.
 I agree."
".........What\'s wrong, Rosa‐san.
 ...You\'ve been really quiet for a while now.
 Are you feelin\' sick...?"
From the beginning, Rosa had never been one to willingly cut in on the siblings\' fights.
...But even so, she seemed unmotivated,
 and had said almost nothing at all during this night\'s conference.
The whole time, she had been hanging her head, and appeared to be thinking of something else...
"You\'ve been in a daze for a while now.
 Do you think you can protect the inheritance like that?
 You are also the mother of your child, so get a stronger hold on yourself."
"I, I\'m sorry......"
"I imagine you woke up quite early this morning?
 If you feel sick, you shouldn\'t overdo it."
"......The beds have been prepared in the guest rooms.
 How about taking a rest?
 I will guide you."
"No, ...I\'m fine.
 Thank you."
"...What is it?
 Is there something you\'re worrying about?"
".........No, not really........."
"Are you sure...?
 It feels like your mind has been elsewhere this whole time.
 ...I wonder if that has anything to do with what we\'ve been talking about...?"
At those words, everyone stared at Rosa together.
As if in response, Rosa\'s shoulders quivered.
Apparently Kyrie\'s guess hadn\'t been wrong.
{n}...Nor did Rosa deny it...
"..................No, umm...
 ................................."
She swallowed whatever it was she had been about to say, and went silent again.
By now, even the other siblings were also beginning to realize that something about her demeanor was different from usual...
"What is it?
 ...You\'ve been weird for a while.
 Do you have something on your mind...?"
"All of us\'ve just sworn to remain united, haven\'t we?
 Don\'t be all unfriendly now, worryin\' by yourself.
 Let\'s talk it over."
"......Rosa.
 Tell us."
Pressed by the men one after the other, Rosa made up her mind, and nervously began to open up...
It was almost...
as though she was trying to confess to some modest prank which had inadvertently brought about a serious situation...
such was the atmosphere in the room.
"No, umm......
 ......Th‐this mistress of Grandfather\'s, this {f:5:Beatrice},
 ......is she really, um,
 .........still alive, I was wondering..."
"Huh?
 Obviously she\'s alive.
 She\'s sending letters to us, what more do you want?"
"Whether she\'s healthy or not is a different story though.
 The lovely woman in that portrait must be getting up there in age by now."
"I\'d think she\'s healthy.
 People who are crafty when it comes to money are healthy no matter how old they are!
 Evil plans might even be the best rejuvenating agent.
 Wahahaha."
"......She can\'t be...
......alive."
"Huh?
 ......What did you just say?"
"{f:5:Beatrice} is...
...dead...
 .........I,
 ...I killed her...!"
"Wh‐......what did you say......?!"
"...Wh‐...what do you mean, Rosa...?!"
"B‐but, it\'s not like I was the one who kill—
 ......But, but I was the one that brought her to a place like that!
 ...I really did kill her...
 I tried to make myself believe it was a dream!!"
"......But......it really wasn\'t after all!
 Which means this is......a letter from {f:5:Beatrice}\'s ghost!!
 Uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!"
It was so sudden that everyone was lost for words.
 Rosa kept on talking, unable to stop, holding her head as her hair flew all about...
"Please, calm yourself...!
 Rosa‐san...!"
"I, I have absolutely no clue what\'s goin\' on...!
 Already dead?
 What do you mean...?!"
"......I think it means two things.
 First, ...its literal meaning.
 ...And second, it substantiates that our earlier guess was correct."
"Which means......
 .........Rosa, ......you have met with {f:5:Beatrice}?"
"I, I\'ve never heard Rosa speak about that once.
 ...Rosa, when was it?
 When could you possibly have met {f:5:Beatrice}?!"
"Long ago!
 Long, long, long ago!!
 We had just moved over to the island and I was young!!
 It wasn\'t my fault, it\'s not like {i:I} killed her...!!
 Uuuuuuuuughhhuuu!!"
"...Calm down!
 Nobody\'s blaming you for anything, alright?
 First, drink some water.
 Okay?
 Natsuhi‐san, the pitcher, please."
"Y‐yes.
 .........Here you go, Rosa‐san.
 Please, calm yourself......"
".........................................."
Until Rosa was able to regain her calm amidst her ragged breathing, ......no one was able to speak a word...
