.........The eerie sound of the wind and rain.
Once again, I hazily regained consciousness on top of the bed...
The finger that the witch had bitten off...
...was still attached.
I didn\'t say "it was all an illusion"...
...just that it was still attached.
...After all, the pain and the teeth marks as though a witch had bitten it...
......were still there.
And yet, the window, which I had supposedly smashed, had been fixed as though it had never been broken in the first place...
.........How can I escape this creepy room?
Why am I locked up in this eerie room......all alone...?
I want to get out.
 ......I have to get out.
 ......Let me out of here.........
......The door was sealed with a firm chain.
I could open it a crack, but only enough to peek out into the corridor at best.
......It would probably be hard even to get just a fist through it.
The windows wouldn\'t budge either.
They were no better than barred prison windows...
The bathroom didn\'t even have a window.
......The only thing that could get out through there was the water that flowed out if you turned on the tap.
......No matter how hard I tried, ......I couldn\'t think of any way out of here.
Shut in here like this, I was no more or less than a prisoner.
Unless someone came from outside to save me, ......I wouldn\'t be able to get out for all eternity.
.........In that case, couldn\'t I just call for help?
Yes, the tiny gap I could make in that door had to exist so that I could call for help.
But......could I make the words come out...?
I had tried to call out for help before,
 but for some reason, the words couldn\'t escape my mouth.
......I might have made some kind of mistake.
I might have just lost my voice in my haste and confusion.
I cracked the door open one more time.
The warm light of the hallway flowed in, making the darkness of the room stand out all the more...
Though I couldn\'t hear any voices, I did feel something peaceful.
......I was sure that everyone was in a room at the other end of the hallway, chatting happily about something.
If I could just call out, someone would surely come to save me......
".........Haah, .........haah, ............nng..."
Holding back some indescribable fear, I tried yelling once more...
"..................!!
 ...............!!!
 .....................!!!!"
But the result was the same.
It was like trying to yell underwater.
 ......All I did was get out of breath, unable to call out in the slightest.
".........Haah!!
 Haah, ......haah, ............haah............"
Even though I could say as much as I wanted if I just grumbled to myself inside the room,
 ......whenever I tried to make my voice reach outside, I choked and was unable to say anything.
I understood.
......My body wasn\'t the only thing imprisoned in this eerie locked room.
......My voice was, as well......
Thinking that I could use some other kind of sound to call for help, I tried opening and closing the door violently, making the chain rattle.
It did sound as though it was making a noisy clanking sound, ......but I was sure it was no good.
Even this sound......was imprisoned within the locked room.
No matter how harsh a sound I made, ......I was certain it would be quieter than a leaf falling by the time it reached the other end of the corridor......
I tried using the hateful chain that sealed the door to make a sound to call for someone,
 but that only deepened my despair...
"..................?
 ......This......chain......?"
That\'s insane...
Even though just a second ago, it was a stiff chain that looked like it was used to seal a monster away......
At some point, .........
it had transformed into a normal chain lock.
This changed everything.
Now I could just undo it from the inside...!
I tried to undo the chain, but I couldn\'t pull it off, the chain not being long enough for that while the door was still open a crack.
 Of course.
"......C‐calm down......
 .....................*gulp*..."
I swallowed, ......and calmly closed the door.
Then, ......when I saw that the chain had slackened enough, ...I touched it with my finger to make sure.
......When I was little, ......I hated chains, because I could never get them undone right.
However, ......that was a long time ago.
I could unfasten them normally now.
......Anyone could... It was easy...
Clink......
At that moment, that terrible thought,
 that the demon who had locked me in this room might have been using this as a trap to give me hope and then make me despair even more,
 ......finally stopped haunting me.
The chain lock unfastened,
 ......and the chain dangled there right before my eyes.
......Now,
 ......there was no lock sealing this door.
Please,
 ......don\'t torment me anymore...
...and just...
......open normally......!
......Slowly......the door opened.
I had closed the door in order to undo the chain,
 ......so the warm light from the hallway had been cut off.
What if......I opened it again and that warm light was gone this time?
 ......I was even afraid of that.
However, that was............
......just me over‐imagining things.
Slowly,
 ......expanding before my eyes,
 ...no, this is normal for a door......
As the door let out an annoying creak,
 .........the exit from this cursed locked room finally opened......
"...............!!
 ..................!!!"
Ha...hahaha, I did it......I did it......!
Even my cry of joy was strangled.
......But that didn\'t matter anymore.
All that mattered was that I could get out!
I poked my head out and looked left and right down the corridor.
The warm corridor.
 I can sense people having fun at the other end.
 ......Everyone\'s right there.
 Let\'s go, right now.
"............Gyeh...k.........?!?!"
At that moment, something cold and heartless crushed my throat.
It was as though an iron loop had been fastened around my neck and pulled on hard from behind.
No...not "as though".
......Without my knowing,
 ......at some point...
...a thick, metal collar had been fastened around my neck.
When had this happened?!
 And when I turned around, I despaired even more.
From the inner side of the door I had just opened,
 ......a thick chain extended...
...which was connected to my collar.
I pulled on it, but it didn\'t even budge.
When I shook it, the whole door creaked.
......What...
...th‐...
......the hell.........
The chain that connected to my collar......was attached to the inner side of the door.
Yes.
 The same heartless chain that had secured the door a short while back...had suddenly become a chain holding me in place...
That\'s insane... That\'s insane...!!
Dammit, what\'s going on here?!!
I pulled with all my strength, trying to tear the whole door off,
 but I already knew from repeated experiments that it wouldn\'t even budge.
......I was sure this chain would disappear once I went back inside the room.
But it would never let me leave it.
Though it had appeared to revert to being a normal chain lock, ......nothing had actually changed.
The fact that a "chain lock" bound me to that room was just as true now as ever...
"......Uuu......nnngh......aaaaaaaaahhhh......!!!"
Tears flowing down my face, I pulled with all I had.
......It was completely useless.
 No matter what I did, I\'d never tear it loose.
And I wasn\'t even permitted to call out for help.
......I felt a confused anger at how the demon had mercilessly made me think for just an instant that I\'d escaped.
But no matter how much I yelled, no voice came out, and no one on the other end of the corridor could hear me...
Then,
 .........I noticed...
...an odd stain on the wall of the corridor.
It wasn\'t a stain.
 ......They were letters, traced out by a finger that had been covered in red paint.
".........?!
 ............?!?!"
Those letters, ......which looked like they had been drawn in blood,
 answered my biggest question...
The chain lock must be set.
You may unset it, but it must then be reset.
Unless it is set, this exit of yours will be unusable.
I instantly understood the meaning of that unsettling message.
Then I tried it out, and understood completely.
When I return to the room and reset the chain lock, ......the binding around my neck disappears.
When I undo the chain lock again, ......that heavy feeling around my neck returns.
In other words, I cannot escape this room while the chain lock is still unset.
But that means all I need to do is set the chain while outside the room...!
I undid the chain one more time.
The weighty collar and chain appeared around my neck again.
I stepped out into the corridor and closed the door behind me, leaving only the slightest of cracks.
I stuck my hand through that crack, grabbed the dangling chain, and tried to reset it somehow.
......D‐......dammit......
......It\'s so easy to do from the inside...
......so why...
...is it so hard to do from the outside...?
The gap needed to be wide if I wanted to manipulate the chain well.
However, that made the chain too short to reach.
To bring the chain even close to reaching, I had to close the door as much as possible.
But doing that meant that there wouldn\'t be enough of a gap to fit my hand in.
......Of course, that was perfectly natural.
Chain locks are made to be done from the inside.
They\'d be completely pointless if you could set and unset them from the outside.
That\'s why the length of the chain is specially chosen...
to prevent anyone from setting or unsetting it from the outside.
Maybe I could manage it with some kind of hard and thin tool?
If the gap of the door was just a finger\'s width across, the chain would have enough length to reach.
......If I could just bend a wire hanger so that it fits through the crack...
and work the chain with that......
That\'s right, there\'s a closet just to the side of the door.
 Could there be some hangers in there?
".........Found one...!!
 O‐......ohh, thank God...!!"
A single, cheap‐looking hanger, like one you might find in a laundry room, was hanging there.
......Really?
I\'m pretty sure that when I last looked a short while ago...
...nothing like this was in the closet...
Ah, who cares...!
 Quickly......quickly......!!
I twisted the wire hanger, bending the end with the tip around.
I formed a loop at the end to grab at things with,
 ......making for a sort of burglar\'s tool.
I then dashed out into the corridor again and closed the door almost as far as it would go.
My wrist could never pass through this.
But with the door closed this far, the chain should have extra length to spare...!
And this crack is large enough for me to stick the hanger through...!
Now it\'s just a matter of technique...!
I\'ll definitely be able to do it if I try enough times... I\'m certain of it!!
".........Hah......haah.........haah.........haah...!"
It\'s harder than it looks...
.......But the chain is long enough.
......It isn\'t impossible...!
I had finally gotten my hands on the one way to escape.
......It was hard, yes, but it was theoretically possible.
If it was possible, then I would be able to get out.
I would be able to escape from here...!!
""......Hihi......hihihihihihihihihi......""
"......! ...?!?!"
At that moment, ......I felt a heavy weight on the far side of the door.
It felt as though someone inside the room had leaned against the door...
...with their forehead.
And she...
...the witch...
...had laughed.
Then, I felt a powerful and strange force on the wire hanger.
......Is she trying to grab it away from me?!
Yeah right, like hell I\'ll let go!!
Like hell I\'ll let my one key out of here get stolen while my guard\'s down!!
Fortunately, I had stuck my wrist through it so that I wouldn\'t drop it if my hand got tired.
You won\'t be able to snatch this out of my hands...!
""Hihihi, hihihihihihihihihi......""
The witch on the other side of the door watched me and laughed once more......
Then, ......I noticed something weird.
I looked at my left hand, which I had pressed against the door to hold it in place,
 ......and between the fingers of that hand,
 ......I could see something red.
.........It was...
......red...text.
I realized immediately.
At some point in time, even more bloody letters had been written on the door,
 and my left hand had been covering them up.
Still fighting against the vice‐like strength of the witch beyond the door, ......I moved my left hand to the side.
Where that hand had been...
...bloody letters had indeed been written.
It read.........as though someone had predicted that I\'d struggle this way from the very beginning...
...a message directly from the witch to me.
No matter the method,
 it is impossible to set or unset the chain lock from the outside.
All tricks done from the corridor......had been sealed by the red letters.
"N‐.........no way..............."
""Hihihihihihihi.
 ......Hihihihihihihihihi...!!""
There was suddenly a terrible sound, and the force that had been pulling on the hanger was suddenly released.
And....when I looked at the hanger that was finally free, I lost all hope.
As though it had been hit by the acid of the room\'s darkness,
 .........the tip of the hanger...
...had burnt and bubbled...
...and melted away.
Now it was pitifully short.
 It couldn\'t be used for anything...!
It would be useless to search for a substitute.
......All schemes to fasten the chain from the outside...had been sealed...!
Dammit...
...dammit, dammit, dammit...!!
I threw the remnants of the wire hanger against the floor,
 .......faced the hallway filled with a warm light,
 ......and called for help.
However, I just choked, unable to speak at all.
Everyone\'s just down the corridor.
And everything\'s peaceful there!
I can\'t hear their voices, but I know!
I\'m sure they\'re all having a good time playing cards!
Please, someone notice me!!
 Someone...save me!!!
""Hi...hihihihihihihi...
...hi
hi
hihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi!!""
Aaaaaaaahgggyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh...!!!
"""......Ahahahaha, hahahahahahahaha."""
This time, it wasn\'t the witch\'s voice.
 ......It was the happy voices of everyone else, which I could hear from the other end of the hallway...
Someone, come over here...
...and save meeeeeeeeeeeee......
"Sorry, but I\'m out!"
George slammed his last card down, ending the game with his victory once again.
Everyone gasped in unison.
The cousins\' room was filled with laughter as they enjoyed their card game...
"Whoooooooa, so you really did have it, George‐aniki!
 Damn you...damn you, six of spaaaaaaades!"
"Your eight of diamonds was pretty nasty too.
 Aah, I was so close, ahahahahaha!"
"Uu‐uu‐uu!!
 You\'re incredible, George onii‐chan! You won again!!"
"Yep, looks like we\'ve won again.
 Ahahahahaha."
Maria couldn\'t really hold her own in an all‐out battle.
So, she had teamed up with George, which was why she was celebrating his victory.
"......Gah.....................
 ......Utter defeat."
Kanon winced and let his cards drop to the table.
The game of sevens that Kanon and the cousins had been playing had been a fierce battle.
Normally, they would take things easy since Maria was there, so this sort of game was rare.
Kanon had started taking the game seriously, unwilling to lose,
 so George and Battler had responded and the battle had grown fierce.
Unlike Battler, who was carefree enough to enjoy it whether he won or lost, Kanon\'s mood changed drastically with every victory and defeat.
......It was less of a dislike for losing and more that he just wasn\'t used to playing games.
He wasn\'t used to the idea that "you win some, you lose some",
 so even a loss in a game played for fun was something he took very seriously.
Since he had resolved to win and had unfortunately challenged the veteran players George and Battler,
 the result was plain to see.
As Kanon slumped his shoulders, Jessica slapped him on the back.
"Hey, you almost had it...!
 Ahaha, but man, I love this stuff!
 Fighting all‐out!"
"......Whether I go all‐out or not, it\'s all meaningless if I lose in the end..."
"Are you kidding me?
 If you really give it your all, you can feel good about yourself even if you lose.
 If you lose after hardly trying, then you feel like grumbling and complaining about how you\'d have won if you\'d taken it seriously, right?"
"That\'s right.
 People who really give it their all never complain.
 Those guys are always cheery no matter what the result."
"That\'s right.
 And those people are scarier than anyone else.
 They always learn something from their experience and grow."
"......Very true.
 ...I was a coward, so I could never learn anything.
 ...So even now, I am yet to mature."
I am furniture, so it is useless to dream.
Because he had rigidly believed that, he had distanced himself from everything and shut himself away.
However, during that time, Shannon had undergone many life adventures.
And now, her hand rested on the door separating furniture and Humans......
The old Kanon would only have seen this card game as a way to pass the time.
However, ......the new Kanon was now capable of gaining something new from this experience.
That could probably be called...growth.
Furniture does nothing but rot with the passage of time.
Being able to grow......is a privilege given only to Humans.
"Thanks for playing with us.
 You probably had work to do, like filling in the log, right...?
 Seriously, thanks for going along with us."
"......Not at all.
 I had fun too.
 ......Or perhaps I should say......I now understand why doing things like that is fun.
 Thank you very much for forcing me to come."
"Let\'s challenge ourselves more and more.
 And let\'s go and find more and more things you didn\'t know about."
"......O‐
oh,
 so,
 about what we were talking about...
 Do you wanna try, like, ...g‐guitar?
 I, I mean, it\'s not like you have to or anything, but..."
".........It must be very difficult."
"Y‐yeah, I guess.
 But I\'ll do a good job teaching you, and I\'ll even practice with you.
 Well, I guess I\'m not that much of an expert myself, hahaha..."
At first, Kanon was scared of touching a musical instrument for the first time in his life, certain he would make a complete fool of himself.
......He knew that screwing up like that would make him feel bad.
......However, Kanon was starting to learn.
"It\'s only natural that I\'ll be bad when I first start.
 ......If I just try to run away from that, I\'ll never learn a thing for all eternity.
 I\'ll never achieve anything."
"Yep.
 Isn\'t that why people love it when they feel themselves improving?
 Even I sucked at making my left and right hands move at the same time when I first started...!
 But I slowly got the knack of it, and it started to feel more and more natural...!"
"........................
 ......I\'d like to reach that level too.
 If one path to that goal is playing music with you, Milady, ......I would love to do that with you."
"R‐really...?!"
"Yes.
 ......I\'m sure I\'ll be horrible when I start, and I might even make you lose hope in me at times.
 ......But if I\'ve given it my all, I can take failure in my stride.
 ......That\'s what I learned from you all just now."
"......Hahahahahahaha,
 you\'re embarrassing me..."
"Now, .........I love you even more, Milady.
 Because I averted my eyes for so long, even though you shone like the sun,
 I never noticed you when you were right there next to me..."
"Eheheheh.
 Then I\'d better work even harder to make you love me even more...
 Ehehihi, hahyahyahya..."
Kanon\'s serious and competitive words were more than enough to make Jessica shy.
However, Kanon\'s expression unexpectedly clouded......
".........Milady, the reason I love you is so clear.
 ......That\'s why...I can\'t bear not knowing."
"N‐not knowing what......?"
"......Why you would start to like me.
 .........Unlike you, I do not shine in any sense.
 ......Even now, I\'m just clinging to your back as you shine the way.
 ......I can\'t think of any reason why you would like a wretch like me."
"Th‐......that\'s not true, okay?!
 There are all kinds of good things about you, Kanon‐kun..."
"......Let me swallow my pride and ask.
 ......What about me made you like me, Milady?"
Kanon hung his head.
......He had never learned anything, so he had never been able to take the lead with her.
It made him sad and frustrated that he had always been the one‐sided recipient of her affection...
...and could do nothing but respond to it.
Jessica was lost for words.
......After all, compared to the reason that Kanon had fallen for Jessica,
 .........Jessica\'s reason......was a lot more vague.
She had listened to Shannon talk about her love with George,
 ......and at school, she and her friends always talked about relationships with boys.
There was nothing strange about a girl fascinated by the idea of romance developing an interest in a nearby member of the opposite sex.
......However, if she were to put that into words,
 she would be misinterpreted as saying that any nearby boy would have done just as well......
However, ......if nothing else, she knew what she felt at this moment.
She really did love Kanon, ......and she truly wanted a relationship with him.
They might end up together as a result, or they might not.
But whatever the outcome, she could accept it as long as she held nothing back.
That allowed her to stay true to her feelings, what she knew she felt right now, and act on them seriously.
However, ......she couldn\'t find the right words to tell Kanon this.
When Kanon saw Jessica bite her lower lip in frustration,
 ............he finally realized...
"......I\'m such a fool."
"Huh?"
"What about me do you like?
 ......That very question is foolish.
 It\'s proof that I\'m not serious about myself, and that I haven\'t been able to understand myself.
 ......It\'s horrible of me to try and make you say it for me."
"Th‐that\'s not true...!
 A‐after all, it\'s the first question any girl would like to ask after being given a love confession...!
 Th‐the question "What part of me do you like?"..."
"It was immature of me to ask you that.
 How could anyone like someone so immature?"
"W‐wait, that\'s not..."
Jessica panicked, trying desperately to explain how she felt.
However, Kanon was calm.
 And then, he spoke.
"In that case,
 .........I want you to grow to love me...
...the way I already love you.
 ......I\'ve decided to change myself so that can happen.
 I can\'t possibly hope for you to love me the way I am.
 ......But someday............no matter what..."
"......Yeah.
 I\'m absolutely sure you\'ll become a wonderful person, Kanon‐kun.
 A guy so cool that I can\'t keep my eyes off you.
 Until then, I\'ll stick by you all the way.
 ......We have all the time in the world...!"
"..............................
 ......Unfortunately, there isn\'t that much time left."
"......What about time?"
"When I talk about furniture......it usually saddens you.
 ......But this is something I must talk to you about.
 And it is also something I must fight for with all my soul."
"What are you talking about...?
 I don\'t want to hear any more of that "I\'m furniture so I can\'t fall in love" talk.
 You\'re a Human, not furniture...!"
"I understand.
 That\'s why I intend to become Human.
 But at the moment, I am furniture."
"Just do it, then! Become Human...!"
"The witch taught me once.
 ......The single element of this world.
 She said it was love.
 ......It\'s something that Humans born into this world can take for granted."
"......However, it is not something that those not from this world, who were born as furniture, can take for granted.
 .........In order to gain it for themselves, they must have magic or a miracle."
......In the same way that Nee‐san and George‐sama...
...would never have ended up as they have without borrowing the power of that golden butterfly brooch.
"I don\'t really get this last part."
"......What is it that you do not understand?
 ......Let me hear it."
"Since this game began, ......a large portion of the time has been spent on Shannon and Kanon\'s determination to fall in love.
 ......I have no problem with interpreting that as a story of growth and teenage determination for a girl and boy who call themselves furniture.
 However, one of the assumptions they make feels really out of place to me."
"...............‘Why is magic necessary?’
 ......Is that it...?"
"Both Shannon and Kanon—no, I\'ll purposefully refer to them as "furniture".
 ......The furniture has always claimed that there cannot be love between furniture and Humans.
 That\'s where the magic of the golden butterfly brooch came into play—it was the miraculous result of that magic that love was established between Shannon and George onii‐chan.
 That\'s what they claim."
"Surely it would not be a stretch if they thought that forbidden love across class boundaries...
...could never bear fruit without a miracle of magic......?"
"Oh, I agree.
 Shannon and Kanon are both servants in love with members of the Ushiromiya family,
 so it makes perfect sense to me that they might disparage themselves as furniture while suffering from their forbidden love."
"......Then what is it that does not make sense to you...?"
"‘Without the power of magic once more, marriage will be impossible’.
 ......Shannon and Kanon both seem to share that view.
 ......That\'s the part that I just can\'t understand."
After meeting in secret for quite some time, George and Shannon had finally gotten engaged.
Both were fully prepared for it emotionally,
 and though there would be some trouble with the relatives, it had gotten to the point where it would probably be impossible for anyone to prevent their marriage.
".........Trying to stand between two who wish to be wed is as foolish as standing in the path of an arrow in flight and trying to catch it."
"Exactly.
 George onii‐chan has sworn to protect his partner for the rest of their lives and no longer fears opposition or disinheritance from his parents.
 ......On the contrary, he even considers them to be the perfect tests to demonstrate his love for her."
".........In other words, they will be married no matter what.
 No one can stop them.
 And they have both consented to the engagement."
"No one can stop them or impede them.
 Trying to break apart lovers is a foolhardy venture..."
"Yeah.
 And that\'s what\'s strange.
 There\'s no need for magic."
If George and Shannon...
...had wanted Eva\'s approval for their engagement...
.........then magic really might have been necessary.
After all, Eva had forbidden his relationship with her.
No matter how much George spoke on Shannon\'s behalf, the chances of Eva being convinced were virtually zero.
If that were the case, it would be understandable if they wanted a magical miracle to make Eva acknowledge their engagement.
"But George onii‐chan has already sworn to it.
 He doesn\'t care whether his parents approve of the engagement or not.
 ......Yeah.
 There\'s nothing standing in the way of their engagement.
 And Shannon should know that well herself.
 So why is it that now, on this night where the proposal went so smoothly, she\'s still praying for a miracle of magic?"
"......Without such a miracle, she will not have the right to marry,
 is what the furniture claim..."
"And there you go.
 It means that Shannon has accepted George\'s proposal,
 ......but she knows that there\'s still some kind of obstacle remaining that can\'t be overcome without a magical miracle.
 And that obstacle isn\'t something that they can overcome by their own efforts.
 That\'s why they need this miracle called magic."
"Why do they need magic?
 If two people love each other, what other miracle could they possibly need to be together?!"
"............Hmm, I see..."
FEATHERINE listened to Ange\'s interpretation, smiling in a satisfied way.
......Apparently, she had already reached that conclusion and was enjoying watching Ange finally manage to do the same.
"And that same question applies to Kanon as well.
 ......The love between him and Jessica onee‐chan has just begun, but their emotions are pure.
 There\'s nothing standing in their way."
"They\'re already in a loving relationship even without the golden butterfly brooch.
 ......It\'d be no surprise if the relationship they\'ve started lasts for years and eventually results in marriage.
 There\'s nothing standing in their way either."
"......As long as they do not seek approval from Krauss and Natsuhi, it seems that they will not need a magical miracle either..."
"Exactly.
 ......Kanon watched how Shannon lived, and changed his own way of life.
 Then, he let his true feelings be known and started a relationship with Jessica onee‐chan.
 ......There\'s no need for magic anymore."
"......If it were a one‐sided love, then he might need a love charm or something.
 But their feelings are already mutual.
 They\'ve already communicated their intentions to one another.
 ......So why do they need a miracle on top of that?"
Both pieces of furniture are in relationships of mutual love.
There shouldn\'t be any need for a miracle any longer.
So why...
...do they still desire a miracle of magic?
And on top of that, the single brooch is portrayed as bestowing only a single miracle.
It feels almost as though Shannon is hesitating because, if she uses up that miracle for herself,
 Kanon\'s chances at love will be automatically sealed away for eternity...
"So the question is this:
 ‘Why is furniture not allowed to love?’"
"......So, you ask why love is not permitted without the miracle known as magic."
"And also,
 ......there\'s that golden butterfly brooch that can allow the lamenting furniture to have the love they insisted they were incapable of.
 Just what on Earth is that?"
"Of course, it is a crystallization of magic.
 However, like most magics, it can be burnt by the anti‐magic toxin."
"......So, it can only have an effect for those who believe in magic and witches."
"Correct.
 So, Shannon, who was capable of interacting with me, was able to make use of its benefits.
 However, if Shannon had dropped it in a sandy beach and someone who knew nothing picked it up..."
"......If that person was shrouded in the anti‐magic toxin, they wouldn\'t be able to make use of the brooch\'s magic power..."
"Precisely.
 A witch\'s magical items often lose their power if they are not handed over directly."
"However, in just the same way that a witch can manifest herself if her existence is acknowledged by a great many Humans and the anti‐magic toxin disappears,
 the power of that magical item can also be preserved if it is believed in by a great many people."
"That\'s ironic.
 ......No matter what kind of magic we witches give out, everything depends on whether the Human we give it to can accept it."
"I have heard that the same goes for medicine.
 Even with the exact same medicine, Humans who know of the medicine\'s effect experience it to a greater degree."
"......Oh, I think I understand.
 When taking cold medicine, I\'ve gotten the feeling that it\'s more effective when you read the description on the bottle."
As she listened, Beato thought that magic sounded a bit like a charm.
When most Humans think of magic,
 they think of incredible miracles being performed one after another in front of a crowd.
However, this true magic that the older sister spoke of sounded almost like a charm,
 something that had no effect if the person using it didn\'t believe.
......Shannon\'s heart was captured by George bit by bit as he grew by leaps and bounds.
However, she had given up, thinking that one of lower status such as herself would never find love with him.
That was when BEATRICE had given her the golden butterfly brooch and encouraged her.
Giving up means that you have zero chance of success.
But if, with the power of magic, you think there just might be some chance of your wish coming true,
 the probability then rises to something greater than zero at the very least.
Zero remains zero forever, but if even a faint probability were to exist,
 ......it would be no exaggeration to say that an impossible miracle had occurred, compared to the time when the probability was zero.
Humans can use magic to take "resignation", by which they themselves make the probability of success zero, and cancel it out.
When a Human does not give up, though their chances of success may be small, those chances do exist.
And the stronger their belief, the more those odds rise.
It was easy to imagine that Shannon had made earnest wishes upon the brooch, believed in its effect,
 ......and made many little efforts to get George to like her.
"The power of belief becomes magic......"
"And those who make others believe are witches."
Those who make others believe...
...are witches.
......That\'s an interesting way to put it.
 If you think about it, it\'s true.
Let\'s say a witch steps out into a spotlight, waves her staff in front of a crowd of onlookers,
 and makes a rabbit appear out of thin air.
The many people who see it will surely think that it was a sleight of hand.
They might wonder at how it was accomplished, but they would be sure that it wasn\'t magic,
 and they would applaud the splendid trick that had appeared to be magic.
But what if...
What if they conducted a sacred ceremony inside a great ancient temple in front of a crowd of believers...
culminating in the exact same thing?
......Would any of the people there think that was a sleight of hand?
In fact, in the ancient past, when magic tricks as a form of entertainment didn\'t even exist and divine spirits were worshiped,
 this would doubtlessly have been a miracle of magic...
"I‐in that case,
 ......would this...
...count as magic?"
"Oh?
 Will the witch who cannot use magic now perform it for the first time?"
"H‐......here I have an empty tea cup.
 There is nothing inside it."
"Mhm, it is empty.
 *giggle*, go on."
"I will take this cup,
 ......turn it like this,
 ......and place it upside down on the table."
"Heheheheheheh.
 And then? What next?"
"Umm,
 ......le‐let\'s both close our eyes and chant the incantation."
It was......the same magic that had been used to give Maria candies.
Beato the Elder grinned and closed her eyes.
When she saw this, ......Beato slowly chanted the incantation.
"C‐come, try to remember.
 ......What was inside the cup?"
"Hmm.
 Come, try to remember.
 What was inside the cup?"
As she chanted,
 Beato slowly opened her eyes and made sure that the older sister was repeating her with her eyes closed.
Then, a single gold butterfly appeared out of nowhere,
 ......fluttered down onto the overturned cup, and scattered away in a spray of gold.
"May I open my eyes now?"
".........Y‐yes.
 Please open your eyes and inspect the contents of the cup."
"Well now.
 ......Let us see how well your first bit of magic has worked."
Taking her time and dragging out the suspense a little, the older sister......lifted up the cup.
".........Aha."
"H‐how is it......?"
When the cup was lifted up,
 .........there lay......a single golden rose petal.
"D‐...does this count as...magic......?"
"*cackle*cackle*cackle*......
 Yes, it most certainly does.
 
You used magic to create a golden flower petal inside an overturned cup.
 It was a splendid bit of magic}."
"‘Without love, it cannot be ‘seen’’.
 That much I understand."
"It may be viewed as a trick.
 It may also be believed to be magic.
 ......It all depends upon the toxin of the individual..."
"Then again, ......while this can explain some of the magic that\'s been used in the past, it can\'t explain everything."
"To get back to the point, none of this stuff about believing in magic and charms can answer the question:
 "What is the golden butterfly brooch that can allow the lamenting furniture to have the love they insisted they were incapable of?"
 It\'s not enough for an answer."
"......To take what we heard from the two Beatos at face value,
 ......would it not make sense to consider that magic has the power to cancel out the furniture\'s "resignation"?"
"‘Why mustn\'t furniture fall in love?’
 "Why is the power of the magic brooch necessary?"
 ......Yes, it does seem at a glance as though what you and the Beatos are saying provides an answer, though a vague one.
 However, let me say this as a Reader.
 ......I can\'t accept this as you\'ve presented it."
"You cannot accept it, you say...?"
"......The fate that those pieces of furniture were fighting to overturn was something much more immense than this would allow for.
 I doubt they could reform their way of thinking just because they were given a charm for making relationships."
"It\'s true that the brooch gave Shannon the chance she needed to get together with George onii‐chan,
 but after that, she said she wanted to deepen their relationship without borrowing the power of magic, and she even tried to give the brooch back to Beato.
 She put the miracle of magic behind her at that point.
 ......In that case, why is she once again in need of its power?"
"Well now.
 ......Perhaps there is no way to say it except that love and marriage are very different things."
FEATHERINE laughed lightly.
......She had probably formed a theory of her own and was laughing at Ange, who hadn\'t reached it yet.
"Let me hear it.
 What\'s your view?"
"I\'d like to keep that to myself for just a while longer.
 ......And of course, watching you form doubts and let your mind race is one of the joys of being read aloud to.
 If I gave you my views, you would accept them and stop thinking.
 Then, having you read aloud would be no fun."
".........So, you\'re having me read a mystery novel you already know the answer to, just so you can enjoy watching me blunder about."
"Well, I am the Witch of Theatergoing.
 ......If you wish to laugh at my bad taste, please do not hold back, my miko."
"‘Wa‐ha‐ha‐ha.’"
"Pft, ......*giggle*giggle*, hahahahahahaha..."
I understand that a part of magic is created by a believing heart.
And that magic probably permeates deep into the world of us Humans as well.
However, though it does permeate so far, the power that dwells within magic is small.
Visiting a shrine before an important exam to pray that you\'ll pass is something that many people do.
However, not many people will actually credit that visit as the reason for their success.
Praying like this contains no power except as a calming influence.
In love, where even a small chance and a little bit of courage can cause a major change,
 this power might cause a massive upheaval...
However, .........would the insurmountable fate that those pieces of furniture claim to be in the middle of...
really change because of something like that......?
I think that in the past, the magical power of the brooch as it joined Shannon and George was little more than a good‐luck charm.
However, at this point,
 the magical power that the pieces of furniture are seeking from the brooch, praying for their love to succeed...
......It\'s not something as vague as a charm.
It feels much stronger, like a whole different interpretation of magic.
If you believe in a sleight of hand, it becomes magic.
......But that\'s no more than a child\'s trick.
And that only explains one part of magic.
They...are hoping for something.
They\'re hoping for something with much, much more power...
...for true magic, not a sleight of hand.
"......So then, just what kind of magic...
......are the pieces of furniture expecting from that brooch......?"
".........A golden butterfly...brooch...?"
"The Golden Witch BEATRICE...
......gave a magic charm to Shannon in exchange for smashing a mirror—a charm that makes love succeed.
 ......That\'s what this is."
From his pocket, ......
Kanon pulled a wing of a gold butterfly.
Though it was just a single wing, it was easy to tell from its distinctive shape that it had originally been part of something with a butterfly motif.
"The magic of this brooch gave Shannon the chance she needed to start her relationship with George‐sama.
 ......However, before that magic was fully realized, she left it to me.
 ......So, thanks to the power of this brooch,
 .........I gained your affection, Milady."
"That\'s not true...
 I started liking you because of my own honest feelings..."
"......Thank you very much.
 ...You are Human, so you do not believe in witches or magic.
 It\'s only natural.
 ......However, as furniture created by magic, my very existence here...
...is proof that the miracle of magic exists."
"S‐sorry,
 what are you talking about...?"
Jessica tried her hardest to grasp what Kanon was trying to say.
However, she couldn\'t understand it, and had to ask him to repeat it with a bitter smile...
"...........................
 ......Both Shannon and I...
...need magic to succeed in love.
 The key for that is this brooch.
 ......I stepped on it and crushed it, so we each have one part."
The brooch had lost its power when it was split in half.
However, if it was ever joined together again, ......its magic would be revived.
It would revive the miraculous power that could join furniture and a Human together...
"However, a single brooch can only grant one person\'s wish.
 ......Only one of us furniture can be joined by this single brooch."
It was the single spark of love that the old BEATRICE with her shrill laugh had sown on a day long ago.
That BEATRICE had likened humans who were tormented by this spark to ripe fruit and taken evil pleasure in their suffering.
However, the magic infused within this spark...was real.
It was the only crystallization of magic that the Golden Witch BEATRICE ever left in this world......
Its shine......grew brighter.
"Huh? ......Wh‐...what the...?!"
"It\'s okay.
 ......But please don\'t look right at it.
 It\'ll blind you."
"Gh, .........ghhh.........!"
It grew more brilliant still, shining like the sun.
Jessica didn\'t need Kanon to tell her to put her hands over her eyes......
As the light grew stronger, ......a sound like the roaring of the wind or the tide also grew in intensity.
It already drowned out the sound of the wind and rain outside...
Jessica could no longer even stand, and she crouched on the floor......
It was a flood of sound and light...
 And until it withdrew, Jessica could do nothing but moan......
