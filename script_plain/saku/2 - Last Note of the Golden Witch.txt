"For both black tea and green tea, the taste is always much better if there is a snack served alongside it."
"I agree.
Green tea\'s tartness is much better if you eat it at the same time as sweet wagashi.
The smell of black tea is much better alongside the taste of western sweets.
If you slip into that sort of rhythm, you can enjoy both even more."
"I agree with your opinion,
however... I think that for these particular snacks, you should only prepare one snack per cup."
"I have no idea what you mean by \'these\' snacks.
....I\'ve been eating and drinking for a while, but I still can\'t figure out what this taste is."
"By the way, this sofa is designed to only seat 2 people.
It\'s cramped, Battler."
"Oh, you think so?
That\'s what I thought, too. 
We need to eject somebody."
".....Understood.
I\'ll leave here, so you two get along..."
"Don\'t leave our tea ceremony!!!"
"Shouldn\'t an older brother and younger sister who haven\'t seen seen each other in a while have time together without anybody else?"
"Why are you so proud of being born after Battler?!"
"We\'re blood relatives, while you\'re a complete stranger."
"Older brothers have 2 degrees of blood separation with their younger sisters!
Don\'t me and Battler, as a married couple, only have one degree of separation?"
"Your delusional notion of being a bride is no different from a creepy otaku who declares somebody a \'waifu\' every season!
It\'s totally worthless!"
"You\'re 18 and still a brocon!?
You\'re old enough to vote, and get married, but you still can\'t leave your brother! Isn\'t that ridiculous!!"
"You two...... can you not fight over me......"
"Onii-chan!
Ignore that delusional \'wife\'s!
Right now, you\'re drinking tea with me!!"
"Be quiet, you woman destined for two degrees of blood separation!
Once a man gets a new family, the old one then becomes an outsider.
While you\'re standing in our parlor, we\'ll serve you tea like a stranger *cackle*!"
"Shut up, you homewrecker!!
Out of the way, Onii-chan!! w500 I can\'t kill her!"
"..........AS I WAS SAYING.....,"
~ib~ "Don\'t fight over me!!!"~ib~
"From my point of view, you feel the opposite, Battler."
"W, what do you mean by opposite?"
"In my opinion, he put himself in between us so that we\'d stop fighting."
"And not so that he\'d feel good as he\'s surrounded by two beautiful women fighting over him?"
"And you\'d be enjoying beautiful women on both sides while looking like you\'re the victim, right?"
"He\'d be enjoying those big, beautiful breasts on both his arms.
Wouldn\'t that make him haaappy?
For the most part, that was what I was saying."
"Do you want to spend time with your flesh and blood sister or with some delusional fantasy bride?
Be clear, onii-chan!"
"It\'s your duty as an older brother to encourage her to step away from her brother and her brocon route!"
"Onii-chan, push her off the sofa!!"
"This sofa is ours, and ours alone...!"
"....I-I\'m going to leave, you two can work it out...."
~ib~ "Don\'t leave our tea party!!""Don\'t leave, onii-chan!!"~ib~
Having one couch for three people indeed made for a bustling teatime.
Battler couldn\'t do anything, as the front door was occupied by a witch, and the back his sister.
He wanted to ask them to get along,
but that would only pour oil on the fire, so he could only sit back, vaguely laugh, and pray it would end soon.
......In other words, what was this scenario?
Battler had enough wits about him to know that this was dangerous in advance. 
Even if he could have tea with the witch and his sister, he couldn\'t do both of them at the same time......
"......Beato, Ange,
......when did we start drinking tea here?"
"Fuu.
You finally noticed.
......I have no memory of gathering here to start this tea party."
"I see. Same here.
......When a witch calls summons you, this is what it feels like.... you don\'t remember how you got there......"
"So that means...... we\'re pieces on somebody\'s gameboard."
"I agree.
If that\'s the case, what does the new game master look like?
*cackle*"
"It can\'t be... did they call us here just to watch me and Beato fight over Onii-chan......?
It has to be Bernkastel. Is she unveiling a new Fragment?"
*giggle*
As she\'s mentioned, a new witch\'s figured appeared with a flurry of wind surrounding them......
"Who...are you....?"
"That\'s not Bernkastel..."
"Introduce yourself, guest. ......I may not know who the game master is, but I am the owner of this tearoom.
You have the duty of introducing yourself before me."
"I apologize for the rudeness, Madam BEATRICE, the Golden Witch."
"My name is PIECE.
......Witch of the Piece, as my lord has commanded me to call myself."
"Pea-su? As in peace?"
"No.
Probably as in chess piece."
"Witch of pieces, huh...... I see, I understand the purpose of your visit."
"Indeed.
By order of my lord, I have been sent to this game board to challenge it.
......That is, as an assassin... of you all."
"......I see.
So you\'re here to fight us?
But then it would be three on one."
"Really?
You\'re going to single-handledly beat all three of us?"
"*cackle* *cackle*
The first visitor to this catbox in quite some time seems to be haughty!"
"Are you...... sure about this?"
"My master ordered me to fight you three.
...*giggle*."
"Is it... really okay to look down on us like that?"
"We\'ve closed several cat boxes, haven\'t we?
Us three will all be your opponent!
*cackle* *cackle*"
"*giggle*"
"*cackle* *cackle* *cackle*"
"I like this idea, guest!
So that you can bring back plenty of stories to the master who sent you here, I will give you a complete, thorough, and unrelenting welcome...!"
I\'ll give you such a thorough and unrelenting welcome that you\'ll be able to take those tales back to your master with bloody skin...!"
"Thank you, Lady BEATRICE.
With that, let me unveil my master\'s Fragment..."
"....At any rate, it\'s Bern\'s Fragment.
It\'s going to be in awful taste."
"*cackle*.
This leisurely life in the catbox can be just a little dull."
"Ah.
This tacky Fragment will at least help me stay awake."
"With all due respect,
...my master is not Lady BERNKASTEL."
"Then who is it?
Lambda?
Or an anonymous forgery author from beyond the Sea of Fragments?"
"If I may be humble,
this Fragment was created by the grand theatergoing witch, Featherine Augustus Aurora."
"With that, everybody.
I raise the curtain... on my master\'s Fragment."
"...Now.
I tire of the strict formalities, piece."
Now piece, let me begin my rampage,
piece,
piece."
"Hhehehehe,
hihihihihi!"
"Why are all the witches that come to this cat box like that?"
"You put trash in the trashcan, and toys in the toybox.
And you put garbage..."
"What the?
Since when did my catbox become a garbage bin!?"
"Oh, I forgot to mention something important beforehand, piece."
"That\'s right.
What\'s our win condition?
It can\'t be writing a ten page review of our opinions of it, right?"
"Could it be finding the trick of a closed room murder?"
"Maybe it could be identifying the culprit."
"It is exactly that, piece.
With honor and respect to Lady BEATRICE\'s story, I shall ask that same question, piece."
----Who aaaam I?
"...I see.
So you\'re the same as Clair, and are a stand-in for \'somebody\'."
"So she wants us to point out who that \'somebody\' stands for."
"Correct, piece."
"Hey.
Isn\'t it more tiring to talk like that?"
"Shut up, 
piece! 
I like to piece 
talk like this, piece 
piecepicepiecepiece!!"
"........Onii-chan, you should apologize."
"Umm... Sorry."
"Then let us begin, shall we? It\'s been a long time since the last Fragment!"
"*giggle*
Then, I\'ll raise the curtain, piece!"
A storm was over Rokkenjima.
However, warm light was overflowing from the Ushiromiya Family dining room...
"Happy Halloween!!"
*bang* *bang*
A christmas cracker was pulled, and a sound rang out as Kinzo, the Head of the family,
appeared in a hat styled after a Jack-o-lantern.
It was greeted with thunderous applause and smiles by the other members of the Ushiromiya family.
The oldest son Krauss\'s family.
Krauss, Natsuhi and Jessica.
The oldest daughter Eva\'s family.
Eva, Hideyoshi and George.
The second son\'s family.
Rudolf, Kyrie and Battler. 
And also, Ange. 
The second daughter\'s family.
Rosa and Maria.
And finally the servants,
Genji, Shannon, Kanon, Gohda and Kumasawa.
And furthermore, the advising alchemist to the Ushiromiya Family, Beato...
"This is..... it\'s the Halloween party from \'Twilight\' that Onii-chan showed me."
"Is that so?
Ange didn\'t fall ill with stomach pain, so she was able to attend the family conference in 1986."
"...Piece.
These people... if everybody were to take a commemorative photograph together, would everybody present be displayed in the picture...?"
"Please do not ask questions during the movie, piece.
You should first relax and enjoy it. *giggle*
Any moment now should be my debut, piece! Please, welcome me, piece!"
Around the time of the fun halloween party...
The ocean was surging against the cliffs, and that spray violently scattered about...
Beneath those waves, something glowing a faint blue could be seen.
That small blue light was a Fragment within a bottle.
It was violently slammed into the rocks by the waves and shattered into pieces...
In time with the thunder... the faint glimmer released from the bottle began to fly about like a swarm of butterflies.
The sight of them flying about in a storm was a curious thing.
Heading towards the Ushiromiya manor...
by the rose garden, they form into the figure of a witch...
It is an assassin sent from the Sea of Fragments for tonight\'s tragedy.
A piece...
"Did you think it was the perverted detective who washed ashore here?!
Too bad!
It\'s the witch beauty PIECE-chan, piece!!"
Despite how she was dressed, the witch of pieces looked pathetic as she was battered by the violent winds.
Any sort of umbrella would be flipped inside out.
The witch\'s skirt is no different.
"Hiyaaa!
You can see my underwear, piece!!
Oh, I wasn\'t wearing them, so there was no underwear to see, piece!
Uwaaaaa!"
What would this fool of a witch be able to do... Besides acting goofy?
However, the three who accepted her challenge did not show the slightest sign of being amused.
.......Because they know that the more witches act like this, the more brutal they will be.
But in that sense, everybody was already used to run-of-the-mill killing methods.
Even while asking themselves what that means for their humanity, Battler and Ange are nonchalantly preparing for the tragedy.
Only Beato was excited for it as she ate potato chips.
"...Pi?"
The door was locked, but that had no meaning for a witch.
But when she touched the doorknob to open the door...
Static electricity sparked, and she drew her hand back...
PIECE once again stretched out her hand.
But the result was the same.
Once more, her fingertip was repelled...
"This... is brazen.
It\'s a barrier.
...I see. As one might expect from Kinzo, the Ushiromiya family magician.
An uninvited guest cannot simply cross over the threshold, right, piece?
*giggle*"
Laughing indulgently, she tried to open the door several times, but couldn\'t.
It seemed to be a particularly strong barrier.
At the very least, it looked like the witch of pieces couldn\'t break it...
PIECE, while pretending to gracefully shelter from the rain under the eaves of the entrance vestibule for the time being,
thought about what to do next with an impish smile on her face...
"I apologize for the impoliteness, BEATRICE-sama..."
"I know.
I\'m not so drunk that I wouldn\'t notice without you telling me."
"We\'ll watch how things play out."
"Ignore it.
This is Rokkenjima, also known as Akujikishima.
In this storm, the light that spills from the manor can lure out many demons.
And besides, it has only touched the barrier, not shattered it.
Shannon\'s shield is not easy to break. I know her very well."
"Thank you.
...The barrier tonight is something that can only be broken by a member of the Ushiromiya family."
"...Even so, her just touching the shield is unpleasant."
"Don\'t get so jumpy. Shannon\'s barrier is strong.
You can relax and have fun.
...If there is a monster out there that can breach the barrier, I\'ll gladly become its opponent.
I won\'t let you become its prey.
*cackle*"
"Kanon!
And Shannon!"
"This is a relaxed party.
Can you stop worrying about work for a while?"
"Hey,
he gave you an order."
"Certainly."
"Rudolf-sama, Kyrie-sama.
Where are you going?"
"Oh, I just wanted a small change of scenery."
"The winds outside are very strong.
I will prepare an ashtray for you in the guest room so that you may relax."
"Thank you, Genji,
but we tend to be contrarians."
"Normally you\'d yearn for a warm mansion.
If you\'re relaxing there though, you might want to take a smoke break in the storm.
So this time around, I longed for a bit of the storm.
Aren\'t the eaves of the entrance something?
Once I get a breath of it, I\'ll come right back."
"...Witches\' Fragments truly are expedient.
To have the sacrificial lambs just conveniently go out there voluntarily."
"What do you think of such cheapness as a game master?"
"This way, even if they can\'t break the barrier around the mansion, they can still catch their prey."
"So all they have to do is lure their victims out of the mansion."
"So the victim is out of the mansion, PIECE will be lying in wait?
...Or there might be some trick we don\'t understand yet."
"I see.
...If Rudolf and Kyrie are attacked by somebody suspicious like you said, we wouldn\'t be able to accept that without question."
"Either way, it seems the first victims are my old man and Kyrie.
...Let\'s see what kind of tasteless ways they\'ll use to kill us."
"...I\'ve gotten used to Bernkastel\'s tacky slaughter show."
Ange\'s brow twisted in a grimace.
Battler\'s calm facade was surely difficult to maintain.
For Beato, this was nothing more than a show, so who exactly was killed didn\'t matter.
......But if the first victims of the scenario were killed for no other purpose but to make Battler uncomfortable,
she would never forgive it.
"PIECE.
You\'re most likely just a performer, and not the forgery author of this grotesque show.... but if this is just a tacky grotesque drama..."
"And if it is?"
"It follows you guys\' preferred style.
....Cut open the belly, and drag out the guts..."
"My method of killing is exceedingly refined, piece.
I believe there has been a misunderstanding. Please keep watching, piece.
*giggle*"
"Even in a storm like this, it\'s still nice to be outside."
"Even if it\'s in the middle of a storm, sometimes it\'s just easier for a duo to calm down if it\'s just the two of them."
"Is that right?
Didn\'t you say that to every girl you met at parties?"
"Come on now, isn\'t that stuff past the statute of limitations?
I\'ve totally retired from that awful playboy stuff."
"I wonder if those words are the real deal.
Is there a way for me to really believe them...?
Hmm, I wonder if it\'s due to the storm\'s atmospheric pressure.
Somehow, it always makes feel crazy."
"Hey, hey,
can you at least wait until night-time...?"
"Oh?
But isn\'t it nighttime already...?"
Two impish smiles and captivating lips approached each other...
"I was surprised to see a couple so excited on such a stormy night.
I\'ll kill them in a hockey mask first, piece♪"
"W-who are you?!"
"....W, Who is it... I wonder....?"
Although they were shaken by the unexpected visitor, they were adults and quickly regained their composure.
However... calming down only made it harder to understand the chaos around them.
This is the island of Rokkenjima.
There shouldn\'t be any unknown persons.
If you drifted here with a life jacket like Erika once did, they would recognize that you drifted ashore with a mere glance.
However, this girl didn\'t have an umbrella, and was completely dry.
In addition, she was wearing a strange dress.
...Ah, perhaps she was summoned here for the party....?
"Ah, I see.
Are you perhaps an entertainer for the halloween party today?"
"*laugh* You surprised us.
You\'re a cute girl. 
Though that hockey mask almost made me faint..."
"As soon as you walk in, you\'ll see the servants\' quarters.
You can wait there."
"However....that\'s a lovely dress.
I wonder if you\'re supposed to be some sort of magician?"
"You\'re right.
It might be escape magic.
I wonder if you\'re supposed to break out of a perfect closed room or something.
The old man likes that sorta thing."
"You should rest your shoulders.
Here, come inside."
"I\'m overjoyed.
I cannot enter the barrier unless somebody from the Ushiromiya family invites me, piece."
"Huh?"
"It\'s true for me as well.
I don\'t want to be left out in the storm.
I think I\'ll enter the mansion, piece!"
At that time, a strong wind blew, scattering her hair like a bundle of curtains. 
No, it wasn\'t like that.
A strong wind did not blow.
Then what made them think that?
That was because... her hair had been scattered to such a degree that it was only natural that they would think it was due to the strong winds...
But...her hair....there was so much that it almost looked like a curtain...?
And that curtain coils around Kyrie, poised to swallow her...
"Kyaa
...aaaaa *glub*
...this
......."
At first, it looked like a confused Kyrie was trying to sweep it away ...but that was wrong.
She was drowning.
Kyrie had been swallowed by the sea of PIECE\'s hair and was drowning...
"...H 
...elp....
......Ru... dolf....!!
"H, hey!?
Kyrie!?
Kyrie!?"
When somebody attacks his wife, generally a husband will strike whoever hurt her.
However, Rudolf\'s eyes didn\'t see an \'attack\'.
Rudolf could only understand that his wife was "drowning".
Because of that, he thrust both of his arms into the sea of hair, and tried to drag her out...
"Kyrie, Kyrie!!
Reach out to me more!!
Where, where are you!!"
"...... ......!! ......ghh... ......"
*snap* *crunch*
"K, Kyrie....?"
*snap* *crack* *crack* *crackle* *crunch* *snap*
"Kyrie, where are you!?
Kyrie!!
Kyrieeeeeeee!!!"
What that eerie sound was reminiscent of... is horrifying to even think about.
Rudolf, still frantic, kept shoving his arms into the ocean of hair, but his hands could no longer touch Kyrie.
Even if it is interrupted, the slightest hint of Kirie's voice or presence can no longer be felt ...... now.
Not even the slightest hint of Kyrie\'s voice, intermittent or otherwise, or presence can be felt now...
"*giggle*
That was a delicious snack, piece."
As the sea of hair faded away while it danced in the wind,... only the smiling figure of the witch of pieces remained.
Rudolf\'s brain was still unable to understand the situation.
With a teary-eyed half-smile on his face,
he was sure that this was a bad joke and that Kirie was somewhere hiding and giggling...
at least, that\'s what he\'s trying to believe...
"...As always... they love to flaunt revolting things......"
"Hmm... this isn\'t even sideshow quality in Beato\'s cat box."
"*giggle*
That\'s what I thought, piece.
You can\'t say something at this level is cruel, piece."
"...Wait, Ange.
...don\'t be too quick to judge."
"What do you mean?"
"I see... me and her see it from completely different perspectives..... it\'s unsightly."
"She hurt them, and then swallowed them whole... no more, no less, right...?"
"Right. If it was me, I\'d thrash them around a bit more in order to break their heart.
...but if you swallow the victim, that\'s it."
"She killed, then erased the corpse.
...What more could you possibly do to put the dead to shame?"
"If my guess is right......"
"...Kyrie... ...Ky... rie... ......"
"Who is Kyrie.....?"
"Huh?
............ah................................."
"What is it, 
\'dear\'?"
"A, .....ah?"
"Are you cooling down your butt by squatting here?
*giggle*"
The witch who had just devoured Rudolf\'s wife reached out her hand, smiling. 
But Rudolf took her hand and stood up without feeling disgusted, looking embarrassed...
"W, what...?"
"I see... how disgusting... and repulsive...."
"I, I don\'t understand.
...What happened, Onii-chan...?"
"...I also didn\'t think....... this type of cruelty.... existed...."
Ange still didn\'t understand.
She still didn\'t understand why Battler and Beato were so shocked by this cruelty...
"Hey, hey.
You\'re still a 6-year-old, so is this a little difficult for you, piece?"
"In other words..... Mom was eaten..... and she took her place......?"
"That\'s correct.
.....It\'s likely that is her power."
The power to swallow up somebody whole... and impersonate their existence.
"...Right now, that\'s why my old geezer took her hand with such an embarrassed look on his face.
......That witch.....just ate Kyrie.
...Even the fact that Kyrie existed has been swallowed whole..."
"I... how did I end up slumped over here...?"
"*giggle*
I\'d like to know that myself, Rudolf."
"...I give up.
Was it amnesia...?
No, no, I give up, but I really can\'t ask you this question..."
"Why are you hesitating?
I\'m your \'wife\'.
*giggle* You can ask me anything, \'dear\'♪"
"Ah, really..... sorry.... Heh, I wonder if I\'m getting Alzheimer\'s.... I can\t believe I forgot the name of my young, beautiful bride...."
"Isn\'t it PIECE Ushiromiya, piece?
*giggle* How strange, Rudolf...♪"
"That\'s right, I forgot.
It\'s PIECE.
.....I really am sorry, hahahaha...."
"D...Dad... Are you serious....?!"
"Perhaps this is not limited to Rudolf.
Right now, that person is PIECE Ushiromiya.
....Rudolf\'s wife."
"Kyrie\'s existence was erased to pure white as if an eraser was taken to her...... and then PIECE inserted herself in Kyrie\'s place as if she had always been there..."
"Ange.
Do you still not understand how horrible this scenario is......?"
......Beato, Bern, Lambda, and every other witch you can think of have so far committed every atrocity you can think of in this catbox.
In comparison, Ange seeing a victim swallowed up by hair did not seem like such a brutal thing.
"...You\'re wrong.
PIECE\'s way of killing is unimaginably cruel...."
"That\'s because she eats not only their lives..... but their dignity as well."
"Dignity.... what do you mean?"
"Ange only seems smart because of the atmosphere.
In reality, she\'s a total idiot-type character.
*giggle*"
"...Dignity.
....is only a measure of how many people will weep for you when you pass.
After all, dying while a great number of people hold you dear and dying by the roadside with nobody to remember you are completely different."
"Kyrie at least had human life.
She thought that she was going to go out for a short break with Rudolf and enjoy herself.
So if she were to suddenly die of a heart attack, she would expect Rudolf to mourn her with tears in his eyes."
".....Ah......"
"I would expect Kyrie to feel that way.
She died before her husband\'s eyes....!
And then her husband forgot about her, and all that time they spent together, and even her existence!"
".....Is there another method of killing that can mock the dead to this degree?
No, there isn\'t.
This disgusting method of killing absolutely cannot be matched."
"In this country, since ancient times, the most valuable thing a person can have is life, right?
However, if you look at other countries, life is only the second most important thing."
"..I think...I get it..... something more important than life... is dignity.
......Dignity is what remains of one\'s life, reputation, or efforts after death.
Something important that you have left behind in your lifetime and were able to pass on to someone else.
But once this girl eats you.... you can\'t even leave that behind....."
If you look at world history from anywhere, there are many recorded acts of destroying one\'s dignity after they pass.
However, this is normal by international standards.
The bizarre Japanese culture that says, "If you\'ve settled your debts with your life, I\'ll forgive you without further criticism,
is such an exception to the rule, such an extreme form of heresy,
that I think it might be wrong.
Even after death, there are many examples of somebody digging up a grave and destroying not only corpses, but also tombstones and records, in the world.
Even after the corpse turns to dust,
there are any number of examples of destruction of their existence by erasing their records or accounts of their good deeds or otherwise falsifying them.
As a result of that, myths are often born. 
You can destroy someone\'s dignity hundreds, maybe even thousands of years after their death!
"......The meaning of your existence is to swallow things whole......"
"And on top of that, she takes all those lives she snatched and overwrites them..."
"She killed her.... and then erased her from her husband\'s heart, and took over Kyrie\'s existence......!"
No methods of killing and desecrating the corpse are sufficient to match the level of this cruelty. 
"For humans, this method is the best!
It\'s the most gruesome, cruel, ruthless way of killing, piece!"
"What is it, piece?
Are you in a bad spirits?"
"*giggle* I love being together with you, piece.
My spirits are already lifting."
"Come on, honey.
Now, let\'s enter here.
You should relax."
"O, oh.
......Somehow, you seem off tonight... it\'s sexy."
"Oh, my.
That\'s the highest form of praise, piece♪"
The barrier rejecting outsiders no longer had any meaning. 
However, she now...... no, not "now".
It had been many years since she had married Rudolf and held a rank in the Ushiromiya family.
The halloween party was an extremely relaxed affair.
At a buffet party, you could enjoy the stylish atmosphere, but you would eventually get tired of it.
At the time Rudolf and Piece came back, everybody had taken to counches and placed them in a circle, and were chatting and enjoying each other\'s company.
"Welcome back.
Everybody is relaxed in their couches, would you like me to prepare one for the two of you?""
"Sure, can we get one for the two of us?
And can you get a blanket for Piece?"
"Thank you, piece.
Rudolf, you truly are kind to women, piece."
"Hey, hey, don\'t get me wrong, okay?
There\'s only one gal in the world who I\'m kind to, and that\'s you, Piece."
"*giggle*.
Oh, you......♪
Piece....♪"
While laughing and smiling, Piece fawned on Rudolf and gave him a few kisses on the lips.
"Good grief, they\'re completely absorbed in each other."
"Battler and friends, are you still talking over there?"
"Huh?
I\'m a young man.
I can chat as much as I want."
It was frustrating, but the piece version of Battler was unable to see through Piece\'s magic.
His memory of the word that meant \'Kyrie\' would be completely replaced with the word \'PIECE\'.
"No...... it may not be as simple as rewriting somebody\'s memory."
"If it just interferes with a few people\'s memories, it\'s no different from brainwashing or hypnosis.
......But this witch\'s power is different."
"Ah,... this power... she has to be similar to..."
FEATHERINE AUGUSTUS AURORA.
The witch who had sent PIECE was a top-ranking witch. 
Her power was that she could look down on the world as if it were a storybook and freely rewrite and interfere with it.
PIECE\'s power is not as simple as swallowing Kyrie, taking her place, and making Rudolf believe that she was his wife.
PIECE\'s power, to swallow anything from the world and replace it with herself... was a power very similar to FEATHERINE\'s...
"Because of how I was talking and acting stupidly, you were thinking I was similar to that ill-tempered black cat, or that super-thick paper witch."
"...you\'re referring to the witches of the senate like that..."
"I was created as the messenger to look after the piece that the great AURORA, the Witch of Theatergoing, Drama, and Spectating, sent.
If the great lady AURORA is a candle that shines upon the great pillar that supports this world, I am a being whose fire is a small Fragment of that candle, piece.
...In accordance with my master\'s command, I am to fill the time in this game with antics and buffoonery, piece."
....You all.
If I were to swallow you as if I sneezed, all memories and traces of you in this world would be erased without a trace.
"From the beginning, I was wondering, piece.
How can I make these guys more scared of me?"
Ah, that\'s it.
Since my power is so strong, can they not grasp that fear, piece...?
"Hey, everybody.
...do you remember if it really was three of you that challenged me, piece...?"
...Beato\'s forehead... had a trail of cold sweat flowing down it. 
Battler and Ange... also understood by now the creepy thing PIECE was saying.
Battler.
Ange.
And Beato.
...3 people.
Had she really challenged three people...?
Perhaps...... from their memories, and from the world\'s memories... PIECE had gulped down a fourth person as a warning...?
When they saw PIECE\'s eyes, which seemed to freeze the soul with a mere glance...... all three were imagining the same thing.
If Piece were to swallow me with her hair, I would be erased.
After that happened, would the remaining 2 people be enraged?
Scared? 
No. 
They wouldn\'t show any feelings, and wouldn\'t even realize anything had happened. 
The two people who were left would think there had only been two people from the beginning, and that only two people had challenged PIECE......
"...Are you threatening us, Lady PIECE?"
Beato\'s manner of speaking to PIECE had clearly changed.
Battler and Ange were still unable to loosen their clenched fists on their knees.
"...If our warm welcome has caused offense to you in any way, let me apologize.
...We are shallow and unrefined, and don\'t know how to behave any better..."
"Respect is important, piece.
...So long as everybody shows the highest respect to me, I can be quite generous, piece..."
*thump* Battler, Ange and Beato all crossed their legs in unison, as if to show that they were all on the same page.
However, it was the opposite of an elegant gesture, as they were too careless when they crossed them.
PIECE wasn\'t able to understand what happened in front of her, and forgot to even close her mouth...
...Eh?
...Right now, those three people... finally understood my terribleness, and improved their behavior...?
...Huh....?
"I\'m tired of acting well-behaved.
So... want me to make this easier to understand?"
"I don\'t care what you do with the pieces in the game.
That\'s what these games are all about."
"We thought that since our guest here was tring her best, we should entertain them a little.
But... we just can\'t take it any more."
At their limit?
Of what emotion?
Anger?
"It\'s hilarious!!!
You\'re the most interesting visitor in a long while, coming in and trying to kill a witch with laughter!
*cackle*"
".........?!
........?!?!
......Huh????!!??"
"Do you.... not know why she\'s laughing at you?
...Come on now.
......You thought that if you showed us your power, we\'d all cringe in fear and show respect to you, right?"
Bull\'s eye.
That was right.
But if that was the case, why was she finding it so funny...?!?!
"That\'s a terrifying power.
It\'s enough to fill us with dread.
But...you\'re just so over the top. *laugh*"
"Hey, Great Lady PIECE?
What\'s so scary about yooooou....?
It\'s like saying \'I\'ve checkmated opponents before, are you scared?\' right before you face off against your opponent in a boxing match. What the hellll......??"
The analogy seemed to hit its mark, and Battler burst out laughing.
"Hahahahaha!!
You know, in this place.
Mystery turns into fantasy.
Or fantasy becomes mystery.
The idea of a serious match, where the two sides are trying to get the best out of each other with a single blow, is a very interesting experience.
And this is a social place for lords and ladies who love crazy games like that."
"There is only one thing those of us here are scared of."
"Hypothesis,
inquiry,
flair,
bluff!
When the theory you\'ve finally whittled away to a deduction is smashed to smithereens!"
"Certainly, this \'power to swallow an existence whole\' is interesting!
One of our rare visitors went to great pains to create this gift.
And I was willing to feign awe out of respect for it."
"If you keep acting so high and mighty, saying how scary you are, how tall you are, etc.,...
I\'m afraid we\'re going to lose our patience with your manners, you know?"
"If you truly wanted to scare us, you should finish your question first.
And then we\'ll decide if we want to be scared or to laugh at you."
"You know who you\'re dealing with?
You\'re dealing with a bunch of crazy witches who can drink tea for a thousand years with some locked room murders as a little snack!
"By the way, I completely get your analogy.
...I\'m crazy about boxing and checkmating opponents... kuukuukukukukuku!!"
"Fufufuufufufu..."
"Uhyaahaahaahahahahaahaaaa,
gehahahahahahahaaaaaaaaa!!!!"
"......Heh... haha... Uuuhahahahaahihihii! Pipipipipiipieeeeeece!!!!"
Fuuuuuu!!! ......Haahaahaa......"
"I have indeed been rude, piece. How comical it was that I looked down on you veterans of the Sea of Fragments.
I apologize, piece."
Well then, let us proceed with the game, piece.
But, everybody? 
You said that you would be truly terrified if you were to have your well-thought-out reasoning shattered...?
//If I smash that final deduction you make, will you really look up to me in fear...?
Those words.
...Do you really understand what they entail...?
...Because then all the guts will be vomited out. ...Pieece...
"Then, we\'ll fast-forward past this next burlesque.
I think everyone wants the main course as soon as possible."
"Are we going past the epitaph murders?"
"No no, not at all.
We will not go that far, piece.
Right after this, I will be swallowing Ange whole, piece."
"Ange.
Isn\'t it getting late?
Let\'s finish talking and go back to your room, okay?"
"........................"
"What is it, Ange?
What\'s wrong all of a sudden...?"
"...Onii-chan, that person isn\'t mom..."
"Huh?
What are you talking about, all of a sudden?"
"Oh, my...
Ange, are you already half-asleep?
I\m 
Mom doesn\'t get what you\'re saying...?"
"Who... are you..."
"Aren\'t I your mom, PIECE Ushiromiya?
The one who gave birth to you..."
...Huh?
"...L-
liar!"
*snap*
*crunch*
*thud*......!!!!
"Hey, Rudolf."
"Hm?
What?"
"Would you be interested in making a cute little sister for Battler, piece...?"
"Hey, hey, save that talk for when it\'s just the two of us."
"A sister...?"
"Yeah, a sister for you.
After all, isn\'t being an old child boring, piece...?"
"........................"
"I can\'t imagine having a sister.
I don\'t have any confidence we\'d get along, hahaha."
"If you, my only child, were a cute daughter, I would go straight home and wouldn\'t have damaged my liver."
"Hahaha, shut up, you unhealthy dad."
"She was eaten and forgotten.
...Again, I\'m reminded how awful this power is."
"What\'s interesting is, why did her existence erasure fail to work on Ange?"
"I can\'t tell if it\'s something we should keep in mind,
...or if it\'s just an embellishment of fantasy."
"The goal of this game is just to determine PIECE\'s identity.
It\'s a little different from Beato and Onii-chan\'s game."
"That\'s true.
...In my game, I asked for the illusion of the witch smashed, as well as answering the question \'Who am I?\'"
"PIECE. ...In this game, do will also have to smash the illusion of the witch?"
"....................."
"The question you gave us of \'who am I\' is just one question.
Is there truly only one answer required?
If that\'s the case, in the witch illusion you\'re showing us, the person called the witch of the piece is the culprit, right....?"
"...If the discussion starts to head in a meaningless direction, both me and my master will be bored.
Therefore, we think it is fair to give proper directions, at least to the entrance of the labyrinth.
So, allow me to state this clearly in red."
"#ff0000The only objective of this game is to determine who I am.
I do not care if you affirm or deny fantasy.#ffffff"
"Then let\'s cut to the heart of the matter in the most simple way possible.
Blue declaration. 
#5decffYou are PIECE, Witch of the Piece.#ffffff"
"Of course, that\'s not true.
I\'ll declare it in red. 
#ff0000I am a person who has existed from Episode 1 through Episode 8.#ffffff"
"That\'s impossible.
Nobody who can swallow a human being whole and wipe them from existence has ever appeared."
"Or... are you saying that they had that power when they first appeared, but never demonstrated it?"
"That\'s correct.
#ff0000I was present during Episodes 1 through 8 and had that power during that time. 
This is the first time that my master has allowed me to show it to you.#ffffff"
"If that\'s the case, I have more questions.
So this person is..."
"Wait, Ange.
It seems there is still more to this event.
You\'ll still be able to ask questions even after PIECE has exposed her hand."
"...I guess that\'s true.
Well?
Now that I and mom have been killed and erased... who\'s next?"
"If, by some possibility, everyone on Rokkenjima is wiped out and the question is
\'who am I?\' wouldn\'t the answer be exactly the same as the one for Beato\'s game?"
"No, it won\'t.
She already said in red that she is one \'person\' who exists from Episode 1 through Episode 8."
"...PIECE, please continue.
While fast-forwarding, of course."
"Of course, piece.
Next, Kinzo, Beato, and the magic-savvy servants realized that somebody had gotten through their magic and a fight ensued, piece.
Whether it is reality or fantasy, a battle with Kinzo\'s incredible summoning magic, Beato\'s powerful witchcraft,
Shannon and Kanon\'s furniture powers, and, for the first time, Genji\'s battle magic began to unfold.
However, since you said you would like to fast-forward, we will do so, piece."
"Eh?
Is my part of the show going to be cuuut?
That\'s no fuuun."
"Huh.
Come to think of it, Genji-san never had a single battle scene, even though he seemed pretty strong in the fantasy world, didn\'t he?"
"Genji and Ronove are two sides of the same coin.
Fast-forwarding is a bit of a letdown."
"Please, just keep it snappy and fast-forward, please, PIECE."
"Uufufufu!
"*giggle*!
Understood, piece!"
As you wish, I will fast forward past the charades and the garbage delusions.
PIECE, an intruder from another realm who has blended into the Ushiromiya family.
Although they couldn\'t prevent her invasion, Kinzo and Beato detected here because of a slight feeling of discomfort.
Kinzo and Beato, as well as Genji, Shannon, and Kanon, confronted the witch from another world who claimed the name PIECE Ushiromiya.
However, while they realized PIECE was an uninvited guest from another world, they didn\'t realize that there have already been two sacrifices.
Both Kyrie Ushiromiya and Ange Ushiromiya... have already been erased from this world, as well as the fact they existed.
When a powerful foreign body tries to unilaterally alter the world, or just a Fragment,... it triggers a defensive antibody reaction.
But even then... it is difficult to fully convince them that PIECE Ushiromiya was an enemy.
The strong barrier would alert them to any visitors from a different Fragment, alerting them to her.
...However, as everybody faced off against PIECE.... they recognized her as a familiar relative, PIECE Ushiromiya.
Beato immediately saw through this intense sense of discomfort.
It was a pest with the power to devour an opponents\'s existence and all fragment of their story...
"As you\'d expect from somebody who just introduced herself as an advising alchemist, piece.
...I am impressed that you have seen through my power.
But is that the only thing you\'ve noticed about it...?"
"What is she.... talking about...?"
"Kanon-kun.
....Right now, there are five of us fighting.
....Are you sure there were always five of us?"
"Huh?"
"...Perhaps. There may have been six of us."
In addition to Shannon and Kanon, there could have been one more servant with the -on sound in their name.
Had somebody just been sacrificed as a lesson...?
"Whaaat?
Isn\'t this similar to my golden magic?"
"Fufufufufu.
Now that you mention it, yes.
...However, it\'s a stingy power that can\'t even give me a single gold coin.
Fuuhaahaaha...!"
"...I see.
But is it really the same as golden magic?"
"If we\'re denying fantasy, that\'s probably the easiest way to explain it."
"It\'s unpleasant.
If six-year-old me got my existence erased from this farce from the beginning, why would Onii-chan be on good terms with my parents?"
"That\'s a good point, too.
The golden ingots are piling up.
I\'m absolutely not going to accept that my sister doesn\'t exist, especially while she\'s watching."
"Onii-chan...."
"Hey, PIECE.
If you want to swallow up this brocon, go for it."
"I\'m not going to try to checkmate in this boxing match, piece♪"
In the meantime, the five people led by Kinzo and Beato quickly reduced in number.
Even though they couldn\'t remember how many people were originally in the group, a distorted, strange battle ensued.
Beato, the last one left, is fighting to contain her bewilderment amidst a fierce sense of disorientation.
Was I really fighting this monster all by myself?
Didn\'t I have allies fighting alongside me?
Has she tampered with the world to make it as if I had been fighting alone from the beginning?
"You... you monsteeeer......"
"Thank you, piece♪
That kind of praise pleases my master the most, piece."
*whoosh*!!
*crack*......!!
......*snap*...
...*urk*......
"...Huh...?"
*urk*...
*urk* 
.........
...*ptoo*
"What\'s this... thing..."
PIECE\'s hair, which had gulped down 5 people, spit something out in digust.
That thing was invisible to the untrained eye.
...the "existence" of the swallowed victims.
"I see.
Unlike normal Humans, those versed in magic are not easily swallowed in their entirety... or so it seems, piece.
Uuufufufuu... they were shrewd little rascals to the very end, piece!"
It seemed that she couldn\'t entirely erase the fact that Kyrie and Ange existed.
Ange and Kyrie\'s names and family names were erased, but it seems those five didn\'t lose that...
"Well, it\'s fine, piece♪
Now there are no more obstacles in my way, piece.
But it is almost time for the fun-filled Halloween party to end.
...The remaining servants were clueless.
Now it seems that only Gohda and Kumasawa are tidying up after the party, piece."
Or so she thought. A couple servants who she hadn\'t seen before materialized and began cleaning up the mess.
Since she ate three of the servants, Genji, Shanon, and Kanon, she thought the servants would have a difficult time tonight, but it doesn\'t seem to be a problem.
The lively and fun halloween party gradually became a relaxed and laid-back one, and thus the party came to an end as the night drew to a close.
Everybody was smiling. Nobody was sad.
It was a night full of happiness for all...
"I had prepared a fun and exciting magic battle for you.
But since you said you weren\'t fond of theatrics, I had to cut it down to the bare essentials, piece.
Ehihihi, are you a little disappointed?"
"I don\'t mind.
If you spend too long describing the food, it\'ll get cold."
"You should quickly serve the food.
I mean, that\'s the whole point of a restaurant, isn\'t it, to have the food fresh and hot?"
"On the other hand, it\'s bad manners to eat with your bare hands before the utensils are even ready."
"However, if you don\'t have a full set of silverware, it\'s impolite to stick your hands in and eat."
"That\'s absolutely right.
I am not going to make the uncivilized demand that you eat with your bare hands.
Please, use your red fork and blue spoon to your heart\'s content, piece♪"
"First of all, about the answer you want from us.
That is to say, the witch\'s identity. I just want to be a little more clear about that."
"As for you,
#5decffa person that exists from Episode 1 to Episode 8#ffffff
correct?
Let me further clarify.
Is that person a person all three of us all can recognize?"
"Define recognize."
"For example..."
"In episode 8, the expression \'many of LAMBDADELTA\'s friends are terrifying monsters\' was said.
If, hypothetically, one of those monsters was the right answer, even though they throughout that Fragment, we wouldn\'t know any of their names.
Therefore, it would be impossible for us to give you the correct answer."
"Ohh, right. I understand.
I\'ll say this in red, piece.
#ff0000You three definitely know my name. 
In other words, my existence and name is one that exists within your memories.#ffffff"
"Memories?
So, we\'ve met them?"
"I will not answer that question.
That would greatly reduce the number of possible answers, which would dampen the excitement, piece."
"Kukuku.
That\'s not surprising.
Three people. 
We\'re three people, with varying life circumstances, who have met and haven\'t met different people.
If she answers that, the scope of possible answers would be quite restricted."
"However... humans, witches, furniture, weapons, and whatnot have appeared inside this catbox...
how many names have even surfaced...?"
"Just assuring us that it\'s possible to answer correctly doesn\'t mean the difficulty level has really dropped..."
"However, there are three of us.
Witch and Human.
Inside and outside the catbox.
We all have differing situations."
"Even so, I can crush all three of you at once.
My master has so much confidence that they told me to fight all three of you at once, piece."
"That\'s right. I didn\'t mention one of the game\'s conditions."
"Now here it comes.
As far as I was concerned, it wasn\'t a worthwhile story yet."
"You should give us at least one condition.
Your side has one person. Our side has three.
If you don\'t have a bit of a handicap, it won\'t be as much fun."
"It\'s not anything significant.
When everybody arrives at their final theory, I want you to agree upon it and announce it together, piece.
Whatever you choose as your answer, if one of you doesn\'t agree, it won\'t be considered an answer, piece."
"......To confirm, is there a limit on the number of times we can declare an answer?"
"Hmm.
If we say every single name we know, we\'ll get it right someday, won\'t we?
If we don\'t have a limit on the number of answers we can declare, it\'s not really a game."
"Idiot.
Why are you proposing a rule that will strangle yourself?"
"We\'re going to win regardless.
The three of us will arrive at the same theory and trounce her in a single blow."
"So this time around, it\'s not shotgun deductions, but more like a sniping rifle?"
"Of course, you use the blue to set up a myriad of checks and balances.
But once you\'ve found the outline, you\'ve got just one shot...!"
"My master didn\'t order me to put a restriction on the number of times you could give an answer.
....But if doing so will make you all more interested in the story and show us a heated logic battle, my master will be happy to oblige."
"....Good grief. Oh, well.
...Thanks to that, it looks like it\'s no longer going to be a trival fight where we just have to name a few suspicious characters at random."
"Then, let\'s begin.
Let\'s take everybody\'s views into consideration."
"With that, let\'s start, piece!!!"
Battler crossed his arms and looked up at the night sky...
Like I did in the game with Beato, I guess I\'ll step into the position of denying fantasy.
With magic, anything goes, and it makes my brain ache.
First... Ange and Kyrie were eaten, and their entire existence was wiped out.
Thus, they were never in this world from its beginning.
Both the piece version of me and my old geezer believed that I had no younger sister.
To think about it in simple terms... this is like Beato\'s cherished golden magic.
Namely, a false narrative that could be created in exchange for money and other rewards.
If you had vast sums of money, you could get people to say that Ange and Kyrie were not in the family...
However, both my and my geezer believe in the idea of \'ladies first\', and we\'re natural contrarians.
Whether it\'s by bribery or threats, I wonder if we\'d submit to the request to behave as if Ange and Kyrie didn\'t exist......
...No.
Is it possible they were taken hostage or something?
So Ange and Kyrie could have been taken hostage... and we were ordered to act as if they didn\'t exist...?
"PIECE. ...Just to clarify, what is the motive behind this strange event?"
"Hoh, as you\'d expect from Battler.
I was just about to ask the same thing."
"Me too.
If some ridiculous whim caused this event, it\'ll break the immersion of this Fragment, and reasoning will be totally pointless."
"......So you\'re saying not to make light of the human heart?"
"The whodunnit, the howdunnit, and the whydunnit.
Each is one of the three blades used to solve the mysteries of the witch, you know. At the same time, the quality of these also determines the standing of the witch."
"Hmm.
The whydunnit is particularly important.
That is what I think is the most important answer in a mystery."
"There is no reason to distrust the standing of the Fragment my master created.
So I will state it in red.
#ff0000There is motive and heart behind this incident.#ffffff"
"Heart?"
"You\'ll understand... it\'s a motive that any Human would understand."
"In other words, it\'s not some paranoid, self-righteous motive that only the culprit can understand?"
"Like where they say DIE while striking them with a coat hanger because they couldn\'t see Mt. Fuji.
Not some unexpected reason that only the culprit would find important, but a third person would go \'you would take a person\'s life for that?\', right?"
"Onii-chan, stop. You should apologize.
If possible, rub your forehead against the ground."
"Sorry.
*scrape* *scrape*..."
...I think we just got a nice big hint.
By looking at the motive, that can be very useful in approaching the truth.
Let\'s make one more push to confirm this.
"...Many people were sacrificed.
Does the culprit hold a motive to kill all of them?"
"Of course, piece."
"For Kyrie and Ange, it was clear you made a conscious decision to kill them.
But what about Grandfather, Beato, Shannon, Kanon, and Genji?
Were you just putting out sparks from the fire raining down on you? Or was there an obvious motive?"
"...There was."
Eh?
...That was an honestly unexpected answer.
Her target was just Kyrie and Ange.
Everybody else was just her putting out the sparks.
If that\'s the case, I can follow the lines of the family tree.
...For example, the first suspect is the person who bears the biggest grudge against Kyrie and Ange, Kyrie\'s younger sister.
Kasumi Sumadera.
We\'ve already seen the depths of her grudge and madness in an earlier Fragment.
I\'m not convinced it\'s her, but she has an understandable motive.
However, if Kasumi was the culprit, she would only have a grudge against Kyrie, and she shouldn\'t meaningfully resent the other members of the family.
Going by the illusion of the witch, the murders of the other members were just her sweeping away sparks.....but that turned out to be wrong.
If Kasumi is the culprit, Grandfather would just barely be her target.
It doesn\'t seem like she would expressly target Beato, Shannon, Kanon, or Genji...!
"...This... You got me... I thought I found a line to follow, but..."
"I wish to be clear, so let me declare it in red, piece."
#ff0000In regards to Beato, Kyrie, Ange, Kinzo, Kanon, Shannon and Genji, I have reasons to want them to disappear.#ffffff
"Why?!"
"There\'s no way she\'ll answer that..."
"No, I\'ll answer.
With the red truth."
"Huh?"
By the nature of the witch\'s game, you dont\'t give out unnecessary hints that could draw your opponent closer to yourself, much less state your motive in red.
But PIECE was doing that.
She says this not in the comical way she has been showing us, but with eyes that have the eeriness of a doll\'s......
"#ff0000In order for me to enter this gameboard, they were pieces that should not exist.
For several of the victims, I was originally going to allow them to live.
However, because of their circumstances, they cannot stay on this game board.
Therefore, I removed them.
Don\'t misunderstand.
We did not remove them because we despised them.
...However, for those I truly wanted to kill,
I had no regards for their hearts and showed them no mercy or pity as I removed them from the gameboard.#ffffff"
...That calm intensity made everybody gulp.
Right now, she was not speaking as the witch of the gameboard.
She was speaking from the heart of the culprit. ...This was a confession.
"Who... is the one you really wanted to kill?!
"...The ones who you really wanted to kill...who on earth were they?!"
"...................................."
...I really thought that Kyrie was the main target, and killing everybody else was incidental or unavoidable.
But with this... I don\'t get it at all.
For example, Grandfather could be her main target.
In order to get a chance to kill him, she could\'ve killed Kyrie and then impersonated her to get into the family conference, looking for an opportunity to assassinate him.
Or, if we accept the illusion of the witch as truth, Beato was the main target, and the process of killing her led to the other victims unintentionally getting caught in the crossfire...
In particular, if you look at how people were killed, the way they were killed in the illusion\'s story is similar to the way the victims appear in previous stories......
For example, it would be similar to Beato\'s epitaph murders.....
No, no, in the first place, as far as the choice of victims goes, having a phony target in addition to a real target is so the whodunnit does not reach the culprit.
But in this case, she said #ff0000"they were all pieces that shouldn\'t exist",#ffffff so it\'s in conflict with what she said earlier.
"...For the howdunnit, doesn\'t it seem like she\'s suspended a spider\'s thread and has now entangled it with our thought...?"
"I think we\'ve figured something important out......but at this point there\'s no use in being captives of our own thoughts. We need to approach it from other angles."
"...Ah... That\'s true...."
"Uuhihihihi pi-piece♪"
"That silly little laugh of yours... It reminds me of someone."
"As she was looking down and laughing at us. .....I kept being reminded of somebody."
"Who?"
"I don\'t have any line of motivation for her. ...But I\'ve been trying to think of what this witch\'s aura brings to mind."
"Whooo aaam I...?
Uuhihihihihiihihihihihihihi..."
"That haughtiness and laughter that delights in her intellectual overbearance. ......It\'s just like my comrade."
"Hmm... that person?"
"This is unexpected, Comrade Ange.
As a witch of truth, it is only natural that I have both grace and intelligence. ......So? How is this tacky witch of pieces similar to me?"
"I don\'t think you\'re the same.
What do you think of this?"
"Show me, Comrade Ange.
The truth you have spun!"
"I didn\'t expect her to show up..."
"Isn\'t your sister a witch that can revive the dead?
If Ange wishes it, life and death don\'t matter."
"...But she doesn\'t call herself a witch that can revive the dead."
"Others don\'t understand it, but they still don\'t have reason to deny it.
That\'s the power of the Witch of Resurrection."
"To summarize, Ange\'s brain can call up virtual personalities at will, like parallel thought processing.
It\'s a handy sort of magic, piece."
"Erika Furudo was the only uninvited guest to drift ashore onto Rokkenjima.
There was nobody else irregular who showed up at the halloween party."
"I\'m the great detective, loved by those who deny the Ushiromiya Family culprit theory."
"The nature of Erika Furudo\'s character has not been firmly established.
All we know is that she is a klutz who fell off a cruise ship."
"However!
When I appeared on the witch\'s game board, I had one trait."
An intellectual rapist.
It was a disgusting nickname.
That was, an intellectual supremacist who looked down on others, and who got the greatest joy from intellectually violating people.
"After she drifted ashore, they welcomed her as an overnight guest.
...She acted superior and irritated them, so it\'s possible that the Ushiromiya family all conspired together to create a fake murder case and discredit her pretensions of being a detective."
"Fuufuufuufu!! No amount of trickery will allow you to evade my \'perfect autopsy\', so you can\'t wriggle out of being in the suspect list by playing dead."
"What do you think of this scenario?
During the halloween party, Erika drifted ashore and was welcomed as a guest."
During the party, the family was very excited from all the puzzles and quizzes.
"Then the self-proclaimed great detective arrived there, couldn\'t read the room, and kept answering and answering, get carried away and making the adults fed up with her."
"Then, the adults who wanted to clear away their humiliation from being beaten by me planned a clumsy farce."
For example... Mom and I suddenly "disappearing".
The next morning, Dad and Onii-chan would ask Erika about it, and Kyrie would jump out as a prank in order to startle and tease her.
"If you look at all the past Fragments, the Ushiromiya family is quite good at \'acting\'... or they enjoy it at the very least."
"She was surprised by their \'acting\'. Or even better, the servants would continue to play dead and then they\'d \'act out\' the serial murder case, you know?"
This crazy story had undeniably appeared in one of the past game records.
Whether it was a reasonable motive or not, even if it was presently one-sided, there was nothing to block Ange\'s logic.
"However, it was decided that all three of us must agree on our answer.
So, I\'m going to hit you with the one-sided truth that me and Erika came to."
"Uuhiihiihiihii!! Just by imagining that lovely face distorting already has me reaching a climax.....!!"
"Uuuuhiihiihihihihihi!!! I see, yes, we are somewhat similar in personality, piece♪
Two similar pieces on the board are really annoying, piece."
"Oh, I see that we only resemble each other in atmosphere.
Are you uncomfortable with such a difference in our mental capacities?"
"Ufufufufufufu......hiihihihipiipipipi!!!
"Uuheeheeheehe......!!!"
~ib~ "Piece!!" "<Good>!!!"~ib~
"Blue declaration!
#5decffThe culprit is Furudo Erika!
This sequence of events was all to trick Erika, or was a farce to mock her!
Everybody suddenly acting like we didn\'t exist was all arranged beforehand!#ffffff"
That will explain what you just said with red truth!
"#ff0000For several of the victims, I was originally going to allow them to live.
However, because of their circumstances, they cannot stay on this game board.
Therefore, I removed them.#ffffff"
What this refers to, clearly, is Erika\'s "perfect autopsy!"
For this woman who calls herself an intellectual rapist, somebody who is an intellectual inferior challenging her with a mystery is akin to blasphemy!
She would fly into a rage, and by way of that perfect autopsy, would change the fate of this silly play...!!
"That\'s check!"
"And mate!!
Everything can be explained by the motive of Erika having her pride as an intellectual rapist hurt!"
"For your red truth of 
#ff0000 \'for those I truly wanted to kill, I had no regards for their hearts and showed them no mercy or pity as I removed them from the gameboard\',#ffffff
you presented a grave sin of trying to fool the great detective with a farce!
You tried it on a great detective!
According to the book, that\'s the same as blasphemy towards god! This a well-deserved divine punishment for blasphemy against me! How do you like that!?"
"For Erika Furudo and Ange Ushiromiya..."
"This level of reasoning is possible!!!"
Ange and Erika stood back-to-back while pointing their index fingers at PIECE as if to condemn her.
Even though two people were pointing at Piece... she didn\'t lose her calm smile.
The other version of Ange, the witch of truth, while showing off a wink with their signature pose, scatters as a faintly glowing swarm of butterflies...
"Piece....♪
I truly am grateful for your piece heartfelt logic, piece♪"
"However, as I already said, I need all three of you to agree for me to accept it, piece."
"After all, you only have one chance.
The great lady Beatrice levied that rule on you herself."
"...You\'ve given us a stupid rule.
Well, I don\'t really mind.
It\'s just a matter of convincing you two."
"..........................."
"...Ange.
Are you really making an Erika culprit theory?"
"You got something better!?"
"If the culprit was limited to humans, your theory would be the best one. ...But this time, even the residents of the witch\'s illusion can be the culprit, right?!"
"Lambda has her monster friends, FEATHERINE has her black cats following her, BERNKASTEL, LAMBDADELTA...
Isn\'t this a free-for-all!?"
"Yes, absolutely! Anything goes!
For this reason, just saying that a person could be the culprit isn\'t enough to uncover the right answer!"
"W, what do you mean......?!"
"She means that in a situation where there are multiple possible culprits, what is possible is not sufficient to prove who is the culprit.
Besides, PIECE\'s first red truth clearly stated
#ff0000I am a person who has existed from Episode 1 through Episode 8.#ffffff"
"In other words, in order to expose PIECE\'s identity in this situation, your whodunnit and howdunnit aren\'t enough to pinpoint a single specific culprit...!!"
"Just a bit ago, you and Onii-chan said that trying to figure out the howdunnit might just ensnare us in one of PIECE\'s traps and confuse us!
So I looked for the who and why, and argued the most probable person was the culprit...!"
"That\'s not good enough...!
The probability is high, but there\'s no reasoning behind it!
We need to narrow it down to only one possible culprit!
Only at that point is it a deduction...!!"
"............Ugh..........................."
Ange is also intelligent, but she has the same weakness her brother does, which is that she is easily clouded by emotion.
So when the reasoning she built up was denied by two people, it took some time to regain her composure.
".....We\'ve given up on the who, why and how.
How are we supposed to reason now?"
"Then, it\'s my turn.
I\'m not a detective.
I\'m a witch.
And witches don\'t reason."
"Me and Ange have been challenging the puzzle under the assumption that it\'s a human culprit.
But now, Beato can flip that premise over and attack from there."
"It\'s like what Kyrie likes to say.
I\'ll turn the chessboard over on her...!
However, I\'m not going to imagine the culprit\'s point of view to make a deduction. ...I\'m going to turn over the assumption that the culprit is a human."
"W, what do you mean....?"
"Isn\'t that a bit different from Lady Beatrice\'s past games? Uufufufufufu..."
"Isn\'t pulling in a resident of the witch illusion a free-for-all!?
Plenty of them would want to swallow humans whole and erase their existences!
Wasn\'t it you who said that if you do that, the truth will never be uncovered!?"
"On the contrary!
For the who and how, \'anything goes\' does not apply!
But the \'why\' is different!"
"Ahh. It would be possible for FEATHERINE or BERNKASTEL to commit the crime.
But they wouldn\'t have a motive to commit such a twisted scenario."
"Don\'t those witches enjoy killing for fun or on a whim!?
Asking for a motive for them is foolish!
Just thinking about it is futile!"
"Now that you know all of what happened in the catbox, can you say that in front of Beato......?"
"...That...... urk..."
In Battler\'s eyes, this was no joke or laughing matter, and Ange realized she had misspoke...
"It\'s a witches\' game. ...Anything goes. It\'s so freaky, crazy, out of touch and insane that it\'s almost ridiculous to even think about it...!!
But don\'t ever underestimate... the heart...!!!"
The witches are ridiculous... they have absurd powers they can use as they please... but they only have one...... just like a baby or an animal...... it\'s bugging me.
"They can\'t tell you what\'s in their heart.
In simple terms, they\'re contrarians who can\'t speak plainly and frankly!
Even though they want somebody to reach their human heart, they can\'t help but avoid humans, but then, they don\'t speak frankly about it!
You lot are helpless, foolish, pitiable idiots!!"
This is why...you can\'t treat the witches\' game carelessly!
"You\'re a stupid, lonely fool, but you\'re still doing your best to frantically write out this Fragment...
so I definitely won\'t say that just thinking about this is futile!!!"
"..........................."
"...fu, ...kuukuukuuku...... I can\'t match the man who treated the millennia-old witch\'s message bottle like the first love letter an elementary schooler wrote."
"......Battler."
I don\'t know if your words are spoken from the mouth of a Human... or from the mouth of the lord of the Golden Land and husband of the Golden Witch.
"When I got my master\'s order... when I came here, I couldn\'t help but think this was annoying.
I wouldn\'t gain anything by coming here.
Rather, I thought that I would just be more digusted with myself."
However... this was worth doing.
"From your mouth. Just by listening to those words. ......Just with those, it was worth coming here today on a witch\'s errand......"
"...Beato.
And PIECE. ...And furthermore, the uncountable number of witches I haven\'t met.
I\'m sorry."
"In addition, you had already declared it in red.
#ff0000"There is motive and heart behind this incident."#ffffff
...I\'m embarrassed I lost my self-control and got sulky."
"Don\'t worry about it.
I\'d expect something refreshing like that from Battler\'s sister."
"But didn\'t using howdunnit fail to get to the answer earlier?"
"Yes, at least when you limited the suspects to just Humans."
"Anything goes, but... can you seriously... read a witch\'s heart... from the howdunnit...?"
"You can.
If a witch truly lacked a human heart... she wouldn\'t have the form of a human!"
Even though they have become witches, they still want to get close to others, so they keep the forms of humans.
If they earnestly look down on humans, and lose interest in them... they will stop having any form, let alone a human form.
They quickly end up as scraps of seaweed.
They sink and scatter in the sea of Fragments, becoming a snowflake in the abyss of oblivion where the sun never shines.
"The one who doesn\'t neglect the heart...... is the Wizard-Hunting Wright."
He is undeniably... a witch killer.
My omnipotent master still hasn\'t forgotten that human... Ushiromiya Battler......
That\'s right. ...All the ghosts of witches want to be defeated like that, with a eulogy, so they gather.
...Like Rokkenjima\'s BEATRICE.
"....Honestly, it\'s unfortunate, piece."
"Unfortunate...?"
"Honestly...... this sourpuss hogging such a cute kid like you as her husband...... is a grave sin to the Senate, to all witches."
"Realllly?
What idiiiiots."
"...For somebody of low rank like me, it\'s crushing...... Battler isn\'t suitable for you."
"Interesting.
Are you going to try anything, you old hag?"
"I gave the two of them free rein to enjoy their deductions, but... I won\'t give you that luxury."
I don\'t know what has offended or upset PIECE.
But I can certainly feel the invisible sparks quietly flying between Beato and PIECE......
"....What\'s driving those two?"
"But it\'s fine. ...you\'ve crossed a great distance over the sea of nothing to come here, so it\'s only fair that we give you a warm welcome."
Now, BEATRICE... my golden brains... rip it open!
This woman, this witch of the piece, rip her open.
That\'s right, what Battler said is correct.
Witches are lonely, and yet they\'re clumsy, stupid idiots who can\'t communicate that.
All they have to say "I\'m lonely, please give me some attention"...
But they are so crass and inconsiderate that they fill a thousand bottles with redundant stories that take a thousand years to read and release them into the ocean...
And the big idiots wait on the beach for someone to read it, even if it takes anyone a thousand years and a thousand times over for them to decipher it......!!
I\'m going to tear you open.....!
And then, I\'ll accept your message....!!
...Why did Kyrie, Ange, Kinzo, Beato, Shannon, Kanon and Genji have to disappear?
She said...
#ff0000In order for me to enter this gameboard, they were pieces that should not exist.#ffffff
What does that mean!?
If we deny fantasy, I\'d interpret it as an unshakeable intent to kill them, maybe even against the rules entirely.
But since this is a witches\' game, maybe there\'s another way to interpret it...!?
For example... \'we\' cannot appear in front of those who possess the anti-magic toxin.
"......However, that rule shouldn\'t apply to pieces who appear other than you guys."
"Are they not able to exist at the same time as them...?
Could it be something like that......?!"
"\'In order for me to enter this gameboard\', pieces that are not allowed to exist..."
"Beato! You shouldn\'t get caught in such stiff logic....!
Aren\'t you the golden witch who managed to solve that old geezer\'s shitty riddle?!"
At any rate... Kinzo\'s epitaph didn\'t require witty reasoning.
It was just childish, self-important wordplay......!!
You needed flexible thinking.
You didn\'t need precise mathematics for these deductions.
You attack it with associations, fantasies and whatever inspiration you can find...!
"Well, well.
Are you calling my mystery mere wordplaaay?"
"This is an important matter.
And since it seems you don\'t understand, I\'ll state it clearly at this point in red truth."
"#ff0000Aren\'t riddles my specialty?
I\'m even better at them than you are. #ffffff"
"...Hohoo...... she\'s... specifically stating it in red......"
"#ff0000So you were completely immersed in solving riddles... but that\'s only been for a short period of time, less than ten years, since you met Battler.
since around the time you met Battler?
Isn\'t ten or so years such a small stretch of time?
Unlike you, I\'m not a little girl.
Ever since before you were born, I\'ve always loved riddles, and am very good at them.
...It\'s regrettable that I wasn\'t able to challenge the riddle of the epitaph."
"If I had challenged the riddle of the epitaph together with you, we surely would\'ve easily solved the childish wordplay that Grandfather frantically dreamt up.
I know because... this was the first time I tried to solve the riddle of the epitaph, as the witch of the piece.
I solved it so easily!#ffffff"
"W......what......?!?!"
The riddle of the epitaph revived Beato as the golden witch.
It is extremely difficult to solve, and the probability of reaching the correct answer is akin to that of an astronomical miracle.
Solving it revived the witch and resulted in a great number of sorrowful mistakes,
which drastically changed the fate of the Ushiromiya family on Rokkenjima......
and she called such a cataclysmic riddle child\'s play, as if she found it easy to answer......?!?!
"Right. What you call the revival of the Golden Witch, you, rising up after six years from nothing...
...and lowering your human self to furniture whose body was incapable of love...
All that was the trigger for the tragedy.
But right now, I am tangled up in intense regret and grief! That grade of puzzle solving!"
If you could have taken on the challenge with me, we could have solved it much sooner......!"
"I would have held in my hand the key that would have saved your life!
...However, the fact that I wasn\'t able to do that was my greatest sin!
Because of that, you were born, Battler was locked in the cat box, and Ange was left all alone in the future...!"
"This is all my responsibility!
I gave birth to you!
I should\'ve given birth earlier! Then, surely... everybody would\'ve been
...
...
much happier!!"
"......Who... the hell...... are you......"
S...she gave birth to me...? ......It can\'t be, the...... mom I\'d only seen in portraits...?
No, it can\'t be that.
It\'s impossible.
Because I\'m positive my mother escaped from Kuwadorian with Rosa, then fell off a cliff to her death.
That happened right after giving birth to me.
Moreover, right after I was born, I was left in Natsuhi\'s care.
If she is my real birth mother, i.e. the previous Beatrice, then the riddle of the epitaph should have been after the important fork in the road of her destiny.
If she really was my mother, she should have said she regretted not raising me herself or not being able to spend time with me in Kuwadorian, or something like that.
That\'s why I don\'t really feel comfortable with the logic that she is my birth parent.
"...But that line of thinking probably isn\'t too off base..."
"Ah... She\'s at a place she can look down on me.
But she isn\'t looking down at me in arrogance.
It\'s from a place similar to trying to guide a very young child... it\'s hard to believe, but
it\'s like she\'s doing it out of parental love!"
"......I, I don\'t understand.
Is that really true for her?
It wasn\'t really what I had in mind..."
"#ff0000Ange.
...Of course you wouldn\'t recognize me.
......Because...
Even though you know my name, we have never met even once.
Furthermore, I will say this.
Until I became the witch of the piece, I did not know your name, or even that you existed.#ffffff"
"T, then I\'d like to ask you the other way around!
Did you ever meet Onii-chan or Beato?!"
"Yes, I have!
Did I meet those two Humans?
I didn\'t just meet them!
I asked them about their hobbies.
I listened to them talk about fashion.
We talked about what they liked.
We had so many meaningless conversations about the weather today or tomorrow, or the oddly shaped shells they found on the beach!
I was always willing to talk for hours if I could see their smiling faces...!!"
"...................................."
...W...what is this witch... talking about...
I can\'t tell if she\'s giving the solution or another mystery......
Do you really not know who I am....?
Hurry up...... isn\'t what I\'m doing right now the verbal equivalent as kicking and screaming?!
I understood up to that... but then, why do I not remember who she is...!!!
I can\'t stop crying from the disappointment and frustration... dammit,
dammit dammit dammit,
dammit aaaah!!!
"I, I\'m the only one she didn\'t meet, and then she didn\'t even know I existed......"
"She\'s undoubtedly related to the Ushiromiya family...!
And yet, she didn\'t even know Ange existed...?"
"It\'s true that back then I used to get sick a lot and miss the family meetings... But still, it\'s not like I\'m an illegitimate child.
All the members of the Ushiromiya family should\'ve known that Ushiromiya Ange existed!"
".............................."
".......................................
!!!"
Battler\'s eyes...... were wide open......
Within his heart...... he then was certain he had found the core of the witch of pieces\' true form.
There was no basis for it.
There was no evidence for it, either.
Nor was there a puzzle piece for guessing the culprit\'s identity.
...But even so, he was sure of his answer.
...There is no such mystery where you can be sure of the answer when you can\'t even form a guess.
Therefore...
This was fantasy. ...Otherwise... she couldn\'t be here. Or \'exist\' here......!
"Ah...... Y, ......you\'re............"
Beato had also noticed that Battler seemed to have seen through the identity of the witch.
But compared to Battler...... she was far away from the answer.
Therefore, she needed a piece of reasoning.
"Why did people need to vanish in order for her to appear on this stage...!?"
"It wasn\'t just Beato and her friends. ...Some of us...... can\'t exist at the same time as her......"
"I, I don\'t understand.
Was there somebody else who had created furniture like Beato had!?"
"No, that\'s not what I meant!
It wasn\'t a single person she couldn\'t meet!
There were two members of the Ushiromiya family that she couldn\'t exist alongside......!"
"W, who...?!
I don\'t know who that could be.
I really don\'t understand...!!"
As tears fell from Ange\'s face into her teacup, she scratched her head in anger over her own weakness... but she still didn\'t stop thinking.
I don\'t remember her!!
I want to remember!
I need to remember!
I want to accept them!!
As the last survivor of the Ushiromiya family... as the witch of the future... isn\'t that my sole responsibility?!
"Ange. ......I called you all the way here to be mean to you. ......I am a piece whose existence is incompatible with yours."
But... I met you, and I understand now.
Your single-mindedness, your clumsiness, but also your straight-lacedness,...... all that was inherited from your brother.
"We are... If we had met, we surely would\'ve gotten along. ...That is what I believe.
......Even so, I would like to give thanks from the bottom of my heart that the two of us were able to meet today by some miracle."
"......It can\'t be......she\'s.........she\'s............"
"Ah....!! That\'s it...this lady is......she\'s........."
"Ange. My wickedness tried to get revenge not only on Kyrie, but on you, too.
For a feud between two women, the right thing to do is to only drag those two involved into the coffin.
...Even though I have never met you,
for the trival purpose of comforting myself by hurting you just because you are her daughter,
I have called you here.
I am truly ashamed of that, especially as a human parent myself......!"
"I\'ve never met you...... I\'d only seen you in pictures...... but I know, I know who you are....! I remember, I remember...!!"
Yes, I hated you too... just by seeing you smile in a picture......
In a family photo without me... Dad and Onii-chan... were smiling at the \'family\' that I didn\'t know, in a way reserved for family members, which I detested... I wasn\'t alive then, but I was still jealous...!!
That\'s right.
We couldn\'t meet due to the wheels of time... and even if we did meet, we wouldn\'t have been able to stay together.
You and I sit on opposite sides of the seesaw, with dad as the fulcrum; we cannot exist at the same time as family members!!
"Your...... your name is......!!!!"
Ushiromiya......
Asumu......
Dad\'s late wife...... who passed away before I was born...!!
"......Ange. ...That still is only a small part of the answer. ...Because, you still need to deny the terrible Fragment I brought with me."
"......Huh...?"
Battler, Ange, and Beato. Since they have already come to a consensus, the answer should already be accepted.
And yet...... why did Piece...... no, Asumu...... still want to hear it from Ange\'s mouth......?
"Well then, start the autopsy. ......because they say cats can be loved, killed, and enjoyed twice."
This was a fantasy about what if Asumu Ujiyomiya had never died and had always been a member of the Ujiyomiya family.
A fairy tale.
So long as Asumu was Rudolf\'s wife, she was a legitimate member of the family and thus invited to the family conference.
Naturally, the family would not recognize Rudolf marrying a second wife.
So, only his legal wife, Asumu, would have been invited.
So...... the fact that Asumu existed in this Fragment automatically meant that Ushiromiya Kyrie could not exist in it.
Kyrie herself would exist, but not as an Ushiromiya.
She would be Kyrie Sumadera.
Therefore, Kyrie Ushiromiya, and her existence, would vanish.
The same can be said for Ange.
....The reason Battler left the family was Ange\'s birth date.
If you counted backwards from the final month of pregnancy...... it was evidence that Kyrie and Rudolf had an affair while Asumu was still alive.
If Asumu was still alive and well, Ushiromiya Ange would not exist.
Even if she was acknowledged, there is no way Kinzo would allow Ange to be added to the Ushiromiya family register.
Therefore, Ange would be an illegitimate child.
The existence of Ange Ushiromiya would vanish and she would have lived as Ange Sumadera instead.
"......I understand up to here. ......But why would you say that this Fragment is something that will hurt me...?"
"Because I lived, encountered the puzzle of the epitaph, became the golden witch before Beato, solved the epitaph, and gave her an important hint to solve it, this scenario is pure fantasy."
"The person called Asumu Ushiromiya... really is the polar opposite of Kyrie."
"....Ah. My mom is fickle... and very mysterious."
The exact opposite of Kyrie.
Kyrie thought with logic, but Asumu thought entirely with inspiration.
So, while Kirie was by far the strongest on a problems involving numbers, Asumu had a talent for solving riddles that could not be solved by logic.
The riddle of the epitaph was exactly that latter sort of puzzle.
No matter how methodical Kirie was in her reasoning, it would never yield an answer.
"I kept living in this Fragment. If only I could have been at the place where your grandfather installed the portrait of the witch and the riddle of the epitaph in his mansion,...... I\'m sure I would have solved it.
And not only that, I would\'ve known who your grandfather had wanted to solve the epitaph\'s riddle.
So I would have had Beato solve the epitaph right away......this is that sort of fantasy."
"And then... when he sees my resurrection, Kinzo dies in front of me.
So at that point in time, Kinzo would have already been dead."
"...Wait.
Uncle Krauss and his conspirators hid Kinzo\'s death for their convenience.
So even though he was actually dead, they would behave as if he was actually alive..."
"...Mom. ...As I thought, this world is a little too convenient."
"Isn\'t that what a fairy tale is, a fantasy...?"
"Ange.
Uncle Krauss and his family only had to hide Grandfather\'s death when they had financial problems."
"......In that world...... I would live not in despair, but in a far-off, calmer everyday life. ......Therefore, after I found the gold, everything would change..."
The trigger that tore up Battler and Shannon\'s relationship was Asumu\'s death.
However, in this fantasy where Asumu did not die, the two of them could continue their friendship.
The seed of unrequited love placed in Shannon\'s chest, whose root tormented her with pain during several years of hell, was never planted.
......After that, as Asumu herself said, it was all a fairy tale......
Those two grew up healthy.
And then, suddenly, the riddle of the epitaph appeared in the mansion.
Asumu\'s intuition told her...... that Kinzo wanted Shannon to perform some sort of miracle.
Although he was quiet, Genji was poor at keeping secrets, and with just a couple questions...
Asumu had discerned that this was settling some sort of animosity with his illegitimate child.
Nanjo had told Kinzo that his years remaining were short, and that he should settle his regrets, and tell the truth to the girl who didn\'t even know her own origins.
He hoped for a miracle and left it to time to decide, even though the chance of failure was high.
Asumu, who was good at puzzles, encouraged the similar mystery-loving Battler and Shannon to attempt and solve the riddle of the epitaph.
She watched and guided them so that they could arrive at the right answer on their own.
In the same year in which the epitaph first appeared, the 20 billion yen of gold had been found by a young boy and girl......
"...Ange. I will say it in place of her, over and over again. ......This is her fairy tale."
"..........................."
At first, Enju... was puzzled as to why PIECE and Beato were so apologetically repeating over and over again that this was a fantasy.
But, little by little... she began to understand that uncomfortable feeling......
"And then.
The girl took a share for herself, one large enough for a more than merely comfortable life, then gave the rest to the Ushiromiya family relatives.
...Therefore, all of the relatives had enough to settle their financial problems.
Concealing Kinzo\'s death was unnecessary.
There was no reason to quarrel... leaving just a happy island."
"So the reason Beato and the others disappeared... was that she left the island."
"That\'s right... Because I did not have the roots of the seed of love within me, I wasn\'t tormented by it, so
I wasn\'t tied to the island and did not need to act the part of the golden witch."
"So Genji disappeared because... the master he had served died, and Beato left the island?"
"He had always decided that if he no longer owed a debt of gratitude to Kinzo and to me, who was responsible for his upbringing, he would leave the island and live out the rest of his days in peace and quiet.
Once Kinzo passed away and I decided to leave the island,... Genji also had nothing more to tie him to the island......"
That\'s why...... they would have vanished from the 1986 Halloween party."
"...In other words... in this game...... within the exact moment of the 1986 Halloween party, depending on if Asumu is alive or not,
it\'s staged as if the witch of pieces eats her opponent whole including the fact that she existed... but it\'s really like a game of spot-the-difference......"
"That\'s correct... One side of the coin is shut up in the catbox of misery.
The other is a world where everyone is happy, with the exception of you and Kyrie.
...Beato fulfilled her dream.
...Battler\'s dream of living with his relatives and going to the same school came true.
He wouldn\'t be hurt by his mother\'s death and his father\'s remarriage... he would also gladly accept that miracle."
"......I see. If that\'s true, then the three of us will agree on that answer and expose your identity.
Even so...... I\'ll deny it. That answer. ......You knew that, right?"
"......Yes.
...I wanted to make you suffer.
You know the answer, but if you deny it, your side cannot win.
...I was going to make it that sort of game... and torment you through it."
"I don\'t get it...... Why would you do that......?!
I can\'t believe... my mother would......!"
"If you don\'t want to believe it, you don\'t have to believe it.
That too is love.
But if you don\'t believe it, at least try and understand it.
How much havoc can one person wreak over one loved one... over just one love? You already know all too well the answer."
"...Instead, give thanks.
So that you don\'t believe that she would want to make herself feel better by tormenting people over a long-held grudge, give thanks for the affection she poured into you..."
If she had been told that Kirie had become Rudolf\'s wife after her death...... there is no way that even Asumu could have been at peace.
For her, a daughter such as Ange was a foreigner in the family that she would never want to acknowledge.
With that emotion at her core, she was made into an assassin piece.
She was the sort of ghost who had a deep-seated hatred for Kyrie and her daughter, who had hijacked her family after she died.
So, even though Ange was not at fault, she tormented her......
"I, I\'m fine.
...I don\'t care about me anymore at this point......!
But what will happen to Ange if this Fragment is recognized...?!
Will she vanish!?"
"Because my mom married into the Ushiromiya family...... a tragedy occured.
If Asumu Ushiromiya Asumu did not die then...... nobody would have been sad.
......I... shouldn\'t have been born."
"That\'s not true!!
Even what we just saw was all within our catbox!"
"That\'s right. ...Ange. Don\'t worry about this."
"Rather than dishonoring myself in life...... I shamed myself after death.
So, Ange... It is I who should be ashamed, not you."
"In addition, you have a reliable brother.
And here, you have a witch who will accept any sort of Fragment.
You should stay.
It is I who should leave."
"......Right. ...That\'s the whole point.
It would be strange for me to feel ashamed of being here.
You\'re such a weird ghost.
...Although the future would be so much happier if you were still alive.
...But you can make up any future you want if you embellish it."
"Right. ...So for this wicked witch of the piece, spit on and forget about me... don\'t ever think of me.
...Ah, that\'s right. .........So that\'s why I have that power.
Ufufufu......"
"......Huh?"
"Battler. ......She\'s..."
"Mom......?!"
The witch of pieces\' hair......
danced as if it was a curtain in the wind,
and billowed out in great sheets.
"It\'s fine, Ange... and Battler...I\'ll heal your sadness right now."
A beautiful bundle of hair, growing like the branches of a large tree, slowly enveloped the body of the witch of pieces......
"Uiipipipipi.
...It seems I also played a strange Human piece, piece.
Well, it was short, but I was able to brush off the dust that had piled up on me in the abyss of oblivion, piece♪"
"Your role was difficult, witch of pieces.
We\'ll be sure to tell your master that you have fulfilled that role brilliantly."
"Goodbye, Battler.
Take good care of your sister.
Girls can be much more fragile than you think......"
"Mom......"
"Goodbye, Ange."
"....................."
"If it is our destiny that only one of us should remain in the Ushiromiya family and live a prosperous future...... I am glad that it was you.
You\'re smarter and stronger than anybody else, and... I\'m glad you\'re the blood of of Kirie Ushiromiya, who was smarter and tougher than anyone else and was willing to go to any length for the sake of her family.
...Ufufufu, it\'s not very healthy to be the daughter of such a pathetic, riddle-happy aunt."
"......Even though... In my whole life, I never called you mom...!!
......Because my mom was jealous of you even after your death... You were dad\'s splendid partner! I can say this without a doubt!"
"Thank you.
I wish you all the best!"
"With that, the curtain falls!
Your opponent was me, the witch of the piece, peaceful lovely Piece!"
May all humanity be at peace.
Mmm~~~~~!
Piece!!"
*bang*
*snap*
......*squish*............!!!
3,
2,
1,
"Piiiiece!
Hi everyone, thank you so much for your hard work, piece!
With this, the curtain falls on \'Umineko no Naku Koro Ni,\' piece!"
"...You had to turn an emotional exit into something so messy."
"You don\'t have to speak so formally.
After all, 07th\'s thank you party is always like this."
"...That\'s right.
When I was in \'Higurashi\', it was happy-go-lucky in order to contrast the dark main story."
"Yeah, I agree!
When it was decided that I was going to be in \'Umineko\', I was told that there would be a party for those who had worked hard on the show, and that there was even an after-party planned in order to dispel the tension in the gloomy original story!!
It sounded fun when I first heard about it."
"So everybody thought that they\'d be watching from behind the scenes.
That\'s really sweet, a hundred times sweeter than diet sugar."
"Oh yeah, by the way, PIECE.
You know, your power of swallowing your opponent\'s existence whole...... you really can?"
"W, what do you mean, piece?"
"She\'s not joking.
That monster of a piece\'s speciality is to remove somebody\'s existence from the script."
"...For FEATHERINE, our world... looks like it was written on paper, and she can take a pencil and eraser to those words to erase and rewrite them as she sees fit, or so I\'ve heard."
"It\'s an awesome power.
For her, the pieces, the game board, and even the rules don\'t matter...... she\'s the most powerful and invincible game master."
"But, couldn\'t such a power ruin her...?"
"What do you mean?"
"Anything goes, you might think, but it\'s not that simple, piece.
If you give me a silent world where no light shines and not a single plant or tree buds, and tell me that I can create freely here without any restrictions, I would be at a loss."
"That\'s creation for you.
It\'s actually easier to make things grow if there are some guidelines and restrictions."
"Draw a cat on a sheet of paper... if you\'re asked this, you can enjoy figuring out what type of cat to draw.
Or, you can be mischievous and try to surprise everyone by drawing something other than a cat."
"...Ah, I see. Indeed.
It\'s kind of hard to do that, just draw whatever you want."
"That\'s right.
Like with writing, I would at least want some sort of theme or prompt."
"That\'s how it is.
The more restrictions are removed, the more the power of creation can spread its wings.
...However, once the lack of restriction passes a certain point, when there are no restrictions at all, contrarily, the power of creation shrinks."
"My lord reached that peak, realized that place was not the place to go for those with purpose, and then returned, piece."
"Then, PIECE!
You only inherited FEATHERINE\'s power of erasure!
So I\'m guessing you can\'t do the opposite?"
"...You mean the power of the pencil?"
"No, no, not that!
The reverse of the ability to swallow somebody\'s whole existence!
Wouldn\'t it be possible to spit out someone whose existence had been erased?!"
"Pi? ......Haaaa, I never thought about that, piece."
"Right now I\'m aware of six of us here, namely me, Beato, Ange, Bern, Lambda, and PIECE."
"Fumufumu.
This is going to be interesting. ......so it\'s possible that there were 7 people here earlier, one of whom has already had been swallowed up and whose existence we have forgotten......?"
"Ueehihihihihi...
Actually, yes. ...There was originally one more guest here, but they were a little noisy, so I swallowed them and put them away."
"Awawa! So it was as I thought?!
That\'s scary, that\'s really scary!
Who was it!?
Who\'d you just swallow!?"
"Then wouldn\'t our memory of them be erased?
So there\'s no point in trying to remember."
"I\'m not sure if I\'ve swallowed them completely, so some memory of them may still linger in you guys, piece. ...To try to help you remember, I\'ll give you a little hint.
First hint.
They\'re a kid who\'s pretty skilled with chopsticks."
"Chopsticks?"
"That doesn\'t seem to match up with this western-style world......?"
"Second hint.
They\'re immensely proud of their reasoning abilities."
"I got it!
It\'s Will, right?!
You didn\'t think I\'d say Battler, right~!?"
"I wonder if there ever was that sort of kid who was good at chopsticks and reasoning?"
"Third hint!
They\'re a self-proclaimed great detective!
And they also go by the title of intellectual rapist!"
"What a horrible, disgusting title..."
"They once put their ear against the wall of a suspect\'s room and listened to what was happening all night long.
After being welcomed as a guest, they snuck out in the middle of the night during the middle of a storm to seal all the windows with duct tape."
"What a bothersome person!
Are they a stalker?
A pervert?!"
"...No good.
I definitely don\'t remember any character like that in \'Umineko\'..."
"They see themselves as Lady LAMBDADELTA\'s rival.
Before, when Lady LAMBDADELTA\'s arm had been torn off, they took it and with a grin, started tickling it, piece."
"Nooooo, that\'s super scaaaaaary!!
Did that kind of kid exist?
Are they here?!"
"Uumu... why would we invite such a person over? ...Who on earth would ever be friends with them?"
"Such a terrible person... I don\'t think it\'s a problem if they disappear...?"
"Isn\'t that right...?
Really, is there anything good about them...?"
"Oh.
Then it\'s fine if I don\'t spit them back out, piece?"
"No objections, nope, nope!!!"
"...Fufufu.
It seems we\'re all in agreement.
I guess it wouldn\'t matter to anyone if the perverted chopsticks detective stalker doesn\'t exist?"
If I told somebody to separate salt and sesame, and they really did it, then asked \'is there anything else you want, my master?\'
as they persistently tried to snuggle up close to me, of course I\'d ask you to swallow them."
If I\'d also found that a noisy cat had suddenly vanished, I wouldn\'t be amused with just that.
I\'d also want to find them spit out in a back alley dumpster later."
"Uehyahyahyahhya!
Then I\'ll do that, piece, Lady Bernkastel♪"
"Ah, where were we?
Did you swallow anyone else?"
"No.
I only swallowed one person today, piece."
"......I see.
So it\'s as Lady LAMBDADELTA said?
Aside from tonight, there may be another person that PIECE has swallowed and erased.
At any rate, I have no idea how many pieces were created in the process of writing these massive tales."
"Well, at any rate, there are a massive number of people who have appeared so far.
We pretend to be a closed circle, but every time we restart, the number of characters increase."
"In the process, there may have been more than a few who were created but never given a chance to play a role and disappeared with the eraser shavings."
"You mean the people who failed the audition for the various Fragments of \'Umineko no Naku Koro ni\'?"
"Yes, yes!
They\'re called reject characters!"
"Certainly... I don\'t remember every single reject character. ...Maybe... PIECE swallowed some of them up and didn\'t even allow them to exist...?"
"Yup, piece~!"
"Ehh?
\'Umineko\' reject characters exist?! Where are they!?"
"The reject characters for \'Umineko\' are usually discarded when they\'re still incomplete, so they don\'t usually have a definite form, piece."
"However, this doesn\'t reduce them to zero, piece.
That\'s right, since this is a thank-you party, I think I\'ll spit up some of the reject characters I swallowed, piece!"
"......Spitting back out... Is there no better way to phrase it......"
"Waahahaha! Don\'t worry, go for it!
A catbox equates to a delusional barf box!
So don\'t hesitate and go for it!"
"\'Umineko\' reject characters are all characters Beato created, right?"
"Correct.
In other words, nobody but me would know them.
If they\'re spit back up, will my memory of them return?"
"That\'s right, piece.
So, if your memory comes back, feel free to give us an explanation and introduction, piece!"
"I\'m both looking forward to it, and very afraid...... how many are there?"
"I think that right now, I can spit up three people, piece.
There are a good deal more, but a lot of them are just concepts with no form, or have fallen completely into the depths of oblivion,
so much so that even I cannot remember their existence, piece."
"Your preamble is too long!
Hurry up and throw up~!"
"Now then, for three bouts of \'Umineko No Naku Koro Ni\' reject characters.
Begin, begin..."
"Ah, are you ready, everybody~?
Since they\'re all reject characters, don\'t expect too much, okay?!"
"Then, come on out, piece!
Our first person!
Nnnng~~~~~~"
PIECE\'s hair spread out like a curtain billowing in the wind.
And just when it became what looked like a large ball...!
~ib~ *pop*!!!~ib~
"Wh...... what... is this...?"
"...There\'s no head.
I wonder who it\'s supposed to be."
"Oooooooh!
This is, this is!
I remember!
This is the rejected body of the goat servants!"
Beato waved her pipe and the familiar shape of the well-dressed goat-headed servant appeared.
"It\'s common for a character\'s face and body to be made separately, piece.
So, the head was drawn separately, piece~."
"Hmmm. If that\'s the case, I\'d like to remake my body over and over again to make it more charming."
"If that\'s the case, I\'d want a more girly, slender body, too."
"Iihihi! Everybody, everybody, you should ask for a big, gigantic chest!"
"...If a female character should inflate their chest, then why don\'t you have them inflate your crotch to the same extent?"
"Oh, that\'s a good idea!
In recent anime and manga, all the girls are swollen up like balloons!
This time, let\'s swell up the male characters\' crotches!
Instead of putting breasts on them, we\'ll put golf bags! Gyaaahaahaahaaha!!"
"I\'m glad to see everyone getting so excited about the mob servants\' rejected body design, piece."
"Then, I\'ll call out the second character!
Nnnng~~~~~~!!!"
~ib~ *pop*!!!~ib~
"...Huh?
What\'s this?
That\'s just Natsuhi?"
"H, hello.
I am Natsuhi Ushiromiya..."
"Ah, ah, ah!
I remember, I remember!
Yes, yes, Natsuhi was also originally a reject character!"
"Eeeeeeeh?
A... Aunt Natsuhi was!?"
"How was she a reject character?
After all, wasn\'t Natsuhi eventually accepted?"
"...No way. ...But... this......"
"Yes, yes!
That\'s right.
To tell the truth, the person you thought was Natsuhi was actually me!
She was a rejected design for BEATRICE!!"
"Eeeeeeeeh!?!?"
"Aunt Natsuhi was... Beato......?!
What does that mean?"
"......Originally, then, the one we thought of as Natushi was how Beatrice was to be portrayed?"
"Eeeeeh?! O... originally I was created as a rejected design for Beatrice?!"
"Ummm, that\'s right.
I couldn\'t help but draw somebody who gave off a mysterious air!"
"I see.
So the slightly wavy hair expresses the twisted nature of the character, piece?"
"But... doesn\'t just she give off the feeling of a rich housewife?
She doesn\'t give off the impression of a mischievous and wicked witch at all."
"So she was on her way to the depths of oblivion, but was brought back when she was selected to play the role of Natsuhi..."
"...If Aunt Natsuhi was Beato....that would have been a very calm and gentle story."
"Perhaps that \'Umineko\' would\'ve been a completely different tale than what it is now."
"Admittedly, I wanted to play the role role of a witch for a while now."
"Well, isn\'t this interesting.
Why don\'t you give it a shot?"
"Eh? Me?!"
"This\'ll be interesting!
Why don\'t you try one of my lines? It doesn\'t have to be word-by-word.
Just perform it in your own style!"
"Well then, I extracted some of BEATRICE\'s greatest lines, piece.
Please take your pick, piece~."
"Well, isn\'t this fine.
Go ahead, Natsuhi."
"....Hm. I don\'t care if it\'s Beato.
But that\'s a rotten line I don\'t want Aunt Natsuhi\'s sophisticated mouth to say, even if it\'s just a recitation..."
"Maybe you can pick a more reasonable line?!
Anyways, no matter how you look at it, this line is..."
"No, I\'ll do it.
We\'re pieces if you\'re talking about witches.
We\'re actors if you\'re talking about Humans.
But nevertheless, if we can\'t play any role, we\'re not a full-fledged participant."
"I like that spirit!
Then, she\'ll make her debut for the first time in Japan! BEATRICE Natsuhi~~!!!"
"Um......"
"Ah, love is lust, totally meaningless unless you\'re sleeping togetheeeeeer"
"Um, men are mere flies and maggots that get drawn to your female scent and crowd around yoooooooou."
......In cases like this, you already know how you\'re going to evaluate the performance even before it\'s finished.
Wow, that\'s pretty good.
I\'m surprisingly into Natsuhi\'s Beato.
Next time, we should make a Fragment where Natsuhi is Beato...
There\'s probably a market for it...
"Um, I tried my best to be intimidating, how, how was it...?!"
"Uh, well, ...haha...you were definitely doing your best....haha...."
"Hmm. As I thought, it\'s enough to just let Beato spew such vulgar words (smile)."
"Hmmm.
I suppose you were right. Elegant speech suit Natsuhi best. Mm-hmm."
"Surprisingly, it wasn\'t as interesting as I\'d expected~.
And now, our third and final person!
Come out, my trump card~!
Nnnnngh.........!!!"
~ib~ *pop*!!!!
"Wow!?
Huh!?
Who is that!?"
"..........................."
A boy?
A girl?
They gave off an air of youth.
Maybe a teenager...?
Not on the witches\' side, judging by the look of their clothing...?
It looks it wouldn\'t be strange for them to appear as a relative...
"Well, well, well!
Even though all I finished was lineart, he\'s been cleaned and colored!"
"I thought it would not be interesting to show him as he was, so I had it colored, piece."
"You shouldn\'t judge a book by its cover, but... I\'m not sure what it is, but I get the feeling that we wouldn\'t get along? Iihiihi."
"That\'s right!
This man\'s name is Virgilius!
If he\'d appeared onstage, I would\'ve called him Will, since that would be a shortened version of his name (in katakana)!"
"...Having two Wills would be confusing."
"If that\'s what you say, then we have VIRGILIA and Virgilius.
They\'re similar enough to be confusing."
"Because, VIRGILIA is, as I recall, a name of a character in a play from long ago."
As I recall, it means "He who leads us to BEATRICE"... I see.
Her role is similar to the one in the original source, so it makes sense that their names would be similar!"
"That is exactly right.
Good deduction!"
"Hey, Beato!
Can this kid not talk?
That\'s bo-ring!"
"Hmm.
After all, I only drew a rough sketch of him standing up along with two or three scenes.
I didn\'t decide on his personality or way of speaking."
"What, that\'s bo-ring!
Such a pretty life-size picture, and he can\'t even say hello!?"
"Even if he\'s just reciting lines, you might as well put him in those 2 or 3 scenes and let him talk a little."
"That\'s easy for you to say.
Moving one piece should be enough for a scene..."
"Well, well, well!
That\'s fine, that\'s fine!
We can probably mix something in."
"..........................."
"...But, he doesn\'t feel like he\'s a piece on the witches\' side."
"That\'s what I thought, too.
If you\'re a witch, you should be dressed eccentrically.
...He looks more like a human, doesn\'t he?
"That\'s right!
Originally, he was created as a \'Human detective\'!"
"Eh?!
Then, in other words, Eri.....huh? ...Eri, Eri.....ugh."
"She was being bothersome, so I spit Erika out in a back alley dumpster."
"Ah, I remember her now!
In other words, he was the origin of Erika\'s character!?"
"Erika was a rival piece created to become an enemy of Battler and then be defeated after a fierce battle, all for the sake of drama.
But he\'s a little different.
He\'s certainly Battler\'s rival as a detective, but through his extremely misleading deductions,
he gets Battler\'s logic to drift further and further off the path, and torments him for quite a while,
so you could say he was created to be a fated rival."
"Mah debut was planned for Episode 3.
Mah role was that I was s\'posed ta completely knock Battler ta tha bottom after he submitted to the Witch Illusion in EP2."
"Why is he using the Kansai dialect?!
It doesn\'t suit him at all!"
"Shut up, Battler...!"
~ib~ "You just wanted to make him say that!!!!"~ib~
"<Hello!>
There are always two truths.
Without love, it cannot be seen."
"Trick end and magic end!
---Stop pranking me so much!!"
"Originally, he was designed to appear as a strong rival to fight Battler in Episode 3, and would then added as a recurring character in subsequent episodes, piece."
"Really...
As ye rival, was I s\'posed ta be really annoying and noisy!"
"...He really is noisy.
I\'ll modify him to speak normally.
I\'ll do the same for his reasoning."
"Thank you..."
"What other scenes were you planned for?"
"Quite a few, although the details were fairly vague... for instance, apparently somebody from the Ushiromiya family
...was Natsuhi\'s illegitimate child from 19 years ago?
It was something along the lines of a mysterious man arriving at the family conference."
"Ah, so that was the origin of the illegitimate child from 19 years ago in Episode 5!"
I would have been very ruthless and would have had the power to patch together the truth and circumstantial evidence as I wished,
in order to \'fix\' the world with whatever reasoning I could construct.
"I see.
That seems pretty similar to Erika."
The frightening thing about this guy is that he can create any falsehood he wants simply by cutting and pasting the truth.
He can create any kind of truth at will, without mixing in a single lie.
"As I thought, he\'s similar to Erika.
In other words, the scenes he lost when he got rejected were taken over by Erika in Episode 5..."
"To me, he seems like a lot more powerful character than Erika.
Why was he planned for Episode 3, not 5?
Why\'d he leave?
Hey, hey!"
"Hmm. To tell the truth, it was because I was so flashy and violent in Episode 2.
Fantasy became really violent and predominant because of that."
"At that time, what is known as forum culture suddenly blossomed.
The writer and reader were able to connect through the Internet, piece."
"...I see.
So you learned that you went on too much of a spectacular rampage, and great hordes of people surrendered to the witch."
"Umu. Yes.
In the original Episode 3, titled \'Land of the Golden Witch\', I was planning to put in a lot more action and gaudiness than in Episode 2, but..."
"I see?
Since you noticed that your readership was thrown into chaos, you changed gears."
"That\'s right. That\'s why, after leaning too much toward the witch side in Episode 2,
it became necessary to leverage the situation to lean toward the Human side in Episode 3. And that\'s why we had to make some adjustments to make it happen.
"...Is that why you created VIRGILIA?"
"Ah, I see... VIRGILIA was really nice and taught me how to fight witches."
"The name was the same, but the character and role did a 180."
"Well, I think I only borrowed the name.
Everything else was shelved until Erika showed up in Episode 5."
"After Episode 5, Erika was just an annoyance.
If Virgilius had appeared in Episode 3, he\'d definitely seem like a evil demon who knocked Battler down to rock bottom over and over again."
"Unfortunately, that choice was not mine... but even so, I feel honored to have been allowed to be introduced in this fashion......"
"Speaking style really is important, piece... he seems completely different than he did when he first showed up, piece."
"Will. It was good to meet you, man, even if it\'s just for a short time.
Maybe the two of us are fighting in some Fragment somewhere."
"...There may be a Fragment like that.
Then, I\'ll make arrangements for us to meet there one day."
"But, I\'ll be the one who wins!!"
~ib~ "You\'re noisy, Battler!!!"
~ib~
~ib~ "I just wanted to say that---!!!"~ib~
The called-up illusions, even if only for a short time, enjoy the fact that they were able to appear on the game board and then disappear back into the world from which they came, praying for their return......
"Please excuse the impoliteness, everybody."
Preparations for the great lady AURORA\'s tea party are finished.
Please follow me.
I will guide you there."
"Then, let\'s move somewhere for the second party!"
"Onii-chan, shouldn\'t you think up some parting words?
You\'re the designee for that."
"Uwaah, this is bad.
It\'s useless, I can\'t think of anything...!"
"I also can\'t think of anything, and I\'m the one in charge of closing greetings!
I\'ll just think about it during the tea party!"
"Not so fast! I\'m going to make a lot of noise, and not give you time to think about it! Come on, let\'s both ad-lib and suffer together!"
"Then, let\'s go and not spend time fussing over it!
Why don\'t we suffer through an ad-lib together?!"
"As always, you\'re all getting along nicely..."
When Erika moved to open the door... a door appears leading to FEATHERINE\'s tea party.
It was only open a crack, but the sound of hordes of people having fun was overflowing from it.
"My master...?
Where are you going?"
Bern and Lambda slowly stood up from the sofa, but they did not make any pretense of heading towards the next tea party.
Only those two looked as if they were slipping out to somewhere else.
"You guys go ahead.
We\'ll be there later."
"...What... are you going to be doing...?"
Bern and Lambda\'s eyes had a strange glow to them.
Earnestly and mysteriously...... their eyes shone like those of a child\'s, as if in anticipation of something wonderful that is about to happen.
"...It\'s a secret.
We just want to take a peek at what was going on."
"Where it cries."
"...Cry...?"
"Yes.
Soon..."
"Something..."
""Will cry.""
"Then, Erika.
Later."
"Next time, I hope it\'s a good role."
"Oh, my, the villain is pretty fun, too."
"I wonder if our roles will be close friends?"
"Or if we\'ll hate each other."
"Either is fine, as long as I can play the same game as you, Bern."
"Oh, my.
We don\'t know if we\'ll play or be played..."
"We\'ll find out soon enough."
""When something else cries.""
