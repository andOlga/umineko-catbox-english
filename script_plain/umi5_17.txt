In the cathedral devoid of people,
 .........a figure could be seen still staring up at the heavens,
 its chest pierced with a long red sword which pinned it in place to the ground.
 ......It was the figure of Battler.
......Ironically,
 it looked just like what he had done to Beato with blue wedges in the fourth game......
Battler had died quite some time ago.
No, .........in this place, the concept of death means nothing except that one has stopped thinking.
Therefore, in a sense, Battler was not dead.
......After being defeated in a fight over the truth, he no longer had the strength to think of a way to resist.
And so...he was dead.
Dlanor\'s massive longsword, which had been left in place of a tombstone,
 ......fastened Battler to the spot even after his death...
This was being lit by a faint light seeping out of a high, high skylight.
Quiet footsteps rang out across this still cathedral......
From the darkness behind a pillar, ......a woman slowly stepped forwards.
......It was BEATRICE.
Her eyes had no light in them, ......and looked the same way they had for so long in the Golden Land,
 still muddied over with gray.
Previously, she couldn\'t even drink black tea properly without assistance,
 ......but now, though it was slow, ...and though there was no life in her eyes,
 ......she was, surprisingly, walking.
And with slow, deliberate steps,
 she reached Battler,
 ......who was still dead and pierced......
Then,
 ......slowly...
...she touched him.
......She tugged...
on his sleeve.
However, Battler showed no reaction......
......When she realized that it wasn\'t sleep...
...but death,
 .........the witch with the forlorn gaze...
...drooped her head even lower...
Then...
...she quietly...
......whispered...
"...............
 ............You
......liar........."
Beato...
...softly touched Battler.........
Then,
 ......she pressed her forehead against Battler\'s chest.
There was no longer......
......any heartbeat.
It wasn\'t just because he had surrendered.
It was because the witches had banished him from the game board.
......So now...
......Battler would never......return...
So now...
.........the Golden Witch BEATRICE...
...had no more reason...
......to exist............
.........Thank you...
......Liar......
...Goodbye......
And.........
...I\'m sorry.
Then,
 ......the Golden Witch,
 ...her task...
...completed,
 ...scattered...
as a spray of gold.
In the Golden Land,
 ......the gray rain...
gently continued to fall.
......There was a faint aroma of good black tea.
Beato stared blankly at the surface of the tea.
There was VIRGILIA, continuing her knitting,
 .........along with me and......Dlanor, talking to each other.
......This is...
......a flashback......
A flashback to a memory of Battler\'s, which Dlanor\'s sword must have given him as it pierced him......
A flashback of that time Dlanor had come to visit the tea party in the Golden Land.........
"The same goes for ME.
 I will not be caught unawares in our next BOUT."
"Perfect.
 I\'ll take you on anytime.
 Give me everything you\'ve got."
"You have my WORD.
 Everything I HAVE."
......Dlanor.
I\'d thought she was a ruthless killer doll without a heart,
 ...but maybe she actually is pretty approachable.
......Though of course, neither of us will show any mercy when fighting on the game board.
For a while, we gazed at the rain‐drenched rose garden...
as we quietly enjoyed our tea.
"......Still, it really is terrifying.
 The way you fight.
 ......Knox\'s Ten Commandments, or the Decalogue, wasn\'t it?
 Those fallbacks of the mystery genre, right?"
"YES.
 ......They are commandments conceived by my FATHER."
"Hidden doors must not exist.
 That\'s Knox\'s third commandment, right?
 That means there\'s no need for detectives to even look for hidden doors.
 ......Sounds pretty ridiculous."
BERNKASTEL talked about this.
She said that even searching for hidden doors was a waste of time because they\'re forbidden by Knox\'s third commandment.
It makes me want to argue back and say it isn\'t so uncommon for a rich family\'s mansion to have a hidden door or two built into it.
......But apparently, you can get away with that kind of rule in the mystery genre.
As an aside, there exist many wonderful mysteries in which hidden doors appear,
 and where hidden doors are the theme.
......Though of course this is limited to novels which have the "premise" that hidden doors exist.
Without that "premise", hidden doors mustn\'t exist.
So if that "premise" isn\'t there, there\'s no need to search for hidden doors.
......I think that\'s probably the essence of her ridiculous argument.
I get the feeling that the detective trying to expose the truth and the illusion trying to mask it with fiction...
are getting blended together, leading to a bizarre form of argument similar to a Devil\'s Proof.
Making a locked‐room murder seem to be accomplished by a witch with magic—that\'s fantasy.
Exposing that it was a Human\'s crime done with tricks—that\'s anti‐fantasy.
Investigating all possibilities to expose what those tricks are—that\'s mystery.
But claiming that possibilities with no hints supporting them are unworthy of investigation—that\'s......also mystery?
Hidden doors, by definition, are hidden in a way that there can\'t be any clues.
Would claiming that hidden doors therefore necessarily exist even if the detective can\'t find them...
...be anti‐mystery?
.........That\'s enough of that.
This argument is too far of a digression from the riddles I\'m actually supposed to be solving.
My fight is very simple.
I\'m only fighting to explain that it was possible for a Human to carry out these crimes which were supposedly carried out by a witch.
This whole discussion about "mystery" and "anti" doesn\'t serve any purpose.
So I can\'t bring myself to have any particular interest in the rules known as the Knox Decalogue...
"............Do you dislike Knox?"
"It doesn\'t work for me.
 ......There\'s something just wrong about making it possible to deny the existence of all hidden doors without investigating.
 ...It\'s about as dubious as a Devil\'s Proof.
 ......Even though it\'s supposed to be the exact opposite of fantasy, it somehow feels like it\'s the same kind of argument."
"..........................."
"......Ah, I shouldn\'t have said that.
 Your dad was the one who made them, after all."
"Pay that no MIND.
 ......After all, there are some who say they are nothing more than mindless FUN."
"The Decalogue feels like something very arrogant to you, right, Battler‐kun...?"
"......To be honest, yeah.
 ......If there was ever a detective who said he didn\'t need to look for hidden doors because they must not exist,
 everyone should start looking around on the floor to see if some of his screws had come loose..."
"In that case, Battler,
 ......let us say we did away with the third COMMANDMENT.
 In that case, what would happen to locked‐room MYSTERIES...?"
......What if Knox\'s third commandment, "hidden doors are forbidden", didn\'t exist...?
".........You mean if hidden doors became OK to use as the solution to locked‐room mysteries?"
"I do not mean hidden doors with hints or FORESHADOWING.
 ...I mean hidden doors that even the detective cannot find because, of course, they are HIDDEN."
"Battler‐kun, you often fight by using a Devil\'s Proof to propose an undiscoverable element X.
 ......That\'s what this is about."
"That\'d be horrible.
 Locked‐room mysteries would just unravel as stories."
That was another way of saying......that those kinds of stories would simply no longer work.
No one would want to try solving the mystery in the first place if they knew the answer might just be an unforeseeable hidden door.
"......If you aren\'t first given some guarantee that no hidden doors exist,
 you don\'t feel like trying to deduce anything.
 ............I see.
 Knox\'s third commandment is needed.
 ......Without it, locked‐room mysteries wouldn\'t even be worth anyone\'s time."
"If you don\'t feel like trying to deduce anything...what does that mean...?"
"It means you don\'t even feel like reading to begin with."
"That is CORRECT.
 ......Humans are weak creatures who cannot even think unless they have assurance that reasoning is POSSIBLE."
"...That reasoning is possible.
 ......In other words, they need encouragement that they can solve it if they do their best."
That......might actually be true.
......It\'s the same with exercising.
If you\'re told to run ten laps around the campus, you can tough it out.
But if you\'re made to run without even knowing how many laps it\'s going to be,
 you\'ll probably get tired out before you make it around three times.
The same thing goes for thinking and reasoning.
Depending on whether or not a problem is guaranteed to be solvable,
 the way we humans react to it changes completely......
"In detective novels, there\'s always a scene where the detective announces that he\'s discovered who the culprit is.
 ......That\'s a sign saying "The hints have all been given in the previous parts of the story,
 so dear readers, please try to reason it out"."
".........Huh.
 I always thought it was just a classic line... Never knew it had that meaning."
"To put it harshly,
 as long as the detective doesn\'t say that,
 ......even the most avid mystery lover who prides himself on his deductions won\'t feel like trying to solve it."
"......In the previous games, you were like that yourself, were you NOT......?"
"...................................."
Come to mention it,
 ......maybe that really was the case.
My fight against Beato began in earnest starting with the second game, I think.
When Beato threw locked‐room mysteries at me, at first,
 I didn\'t seriously try to tackle them.
After all, I knew nothing except that people had died in a locked room, and the windows and doors were all locked from the inside.
......I had basically no hints.
So I refused to debate, on the grounds that I couldn\'t fight because the lack of clues made reasoning impossible.
......After that, Beato sneered at me, didn\'t she...
asking whether I would repeat that over and over forever in an endless repetition of moves......
At that time, Beato said this:
— The reason you incompetent fools always stop thinking and then moan about it is "lack of information"!
 If you are then given information, you start doubting whether the information is true or not by "denying the basis"!
 Aren\'t those convenient?
 What clever little words to hide your own incompetence.
Then, she said she\'d give me reliable information that couldn\'t be denied,
 and created the rule called the red truth.
Only after Beato had done all that for me did the curtain finally rise on my battle with her......
"......So, ......once I finally had the guarantee that I could solve this tale if I tried,
 ......that\'s when I stepped into the ring with her for the first time......?"
"BEATRICE.
 ......She is a strange PERSON.
 Mysteries are the only spaces where witches can live, and yet she herself began to give you the red truth, a method by which those mysteries could be SOLVED."
You could say that the red truth is a hint Beato gives me so that I\'ll agree to compete in this war of reasoning.
......It\'s a carrot.
Being given a hint is like she\'s saying,
 “Go on.
 Try solving it.
 It is possible.”
......An enigma which is guaranteed to be solvable...
...can\'t be called a true "enigma".
"Isn\'t this almost as though...
......Beato herself...
is admitting that she...
...isn\'t really a witch...?"
"Well now.
 That does seem logical.
 ......She truly is a strange child."
"................................."
Beato gave no answer.
With gray eyes, ......she did nothing but blankly gaze at the steam rising from her black tea...
"My father created the Decalogue to act as a crutch for the power of THINKING.
 ......It most certainly was not created to arrogantly insist on the way things must BE."
"......A crutch...for the power of thinking......"
"YES.
 Knox\'s 8th: It is forbidden for the case to be resolved with clues that are not PRESENTED.
 ......This does not only mean that one must avoid making baseless guesses that are not supported by CLUES."
"If you turn it around,
 .........it means that the one posing the mystery must present clues which lead to the solution."
"......So, in other words,
 ......if a story follows the Decalogue,
 ......all riddles must have hints,
 ......and therefore, it\'s guaranteed that finding the solution is possible."
I see......so this is what she means by a crutch for the power of thinking.
If you can believe that it\'s solvable, you start feeling the desire to have a go at those riddles.
If you\'re capable of believing that hints do exist, you get fired up about rereading the story to search for them......
"I\'ll admit......it might have the power of giving courage to people trying to solve it."
"The Knox Decalogue is often thought of as a series of restrictions imposed by the one who made the mystery,
 but it is also vital for the READERS.
 .........By using the Decalogue as a crutch,
 we are given the courage needed to use reasoning, as well as the willpower to reread the tale several times...
in search of the clues we know must be hidden THERE."
".........It\'s like the lid of a jar of jam which is too tight and won\'t open.
 ......Like Mom always used to say,
 ......if you think you can\'t open it, then it really won\'t open no matter how hard you try.
 ......The same thing happens in sports.
 They say that whether or not you have a strong image of yourself and believe you can win no matter what...
has a large impact on the records you set."
In that case,
 the Knox Decalogue isn\'t really a set of arrogant and strict restrictions.
 ......You can also see it as a way to encourage readers, who are trying to solve the mystery, by telling them to give it their all since it\'s definitely solvable...
".........That\'s an interesting way to interpret it.
 ......But I\'ve heard that not every detective novel in the world necessarily follows the Decalogue.
 .........If you ran into one of those, wouldn\'t you feel betrayed...?"
"Even the Decalogue is nothing more than a single interpretation, and it does not apply to all mystery STORIES.
 ......Though among fundamentalists of my father\'s work,
 it seems there are those who harshly criticize works which violate the Decalogue and call them HERESY..."
There\'s no end of arguments like this in the mystery world.
Is this or that famous detective novel a "fair" mystery—in other words, one that follows Knox\'s Ten Commandments?
That sort of argument is already an eternal theme of the mystery world.
In fact, in mystery discussions,
 arguments like these sometimes become more heated than talk about the actual solutions......
"I can understand the criticism.
 ......You try your best to solve a mystery, trusting that it follows the Decalogue and can be solved,
 but then it turns out that it was never made to be solvable in the first place...I can understand how irritating that must be."
That\'s right.
When fighting with the Decalogue, ......there\'s just one thing you want guaranteed from the beginning.
And that is.........the guarantee that the detective novel will adhere to the Decalogue.
If a work labels itself as an orthodox mystery, then you have nothing to worry about.
However, the mystery genre contains many unorthodox sub‐genres within it.
.........Does that mean that trying to use reasoning in an unorthodox detective novel...
is a complete waste of time......?
"......Looking at it that way,
 ......it really does feel arrogant."
"YES.
 I also find it extremely sad that my father\'s Decalogue has been used as such an elitist WEAPON."
"............So...you just fought Beato using the Decalogue as a weapon.
 ......Can I take that as proof that this game world of Beato\'s follows the Knox Decalogue......?"
"......................................."
When I asked that, ......there was a strange silence.
VIRGILIA, Dlanor,
 ......and of course, Beato...
...all remained silent for a while......
Almost as though my question had touched at the core of something...
"That......is something I cannot answer myself."
"Why...?"
"This is a game that this child made.
 ......A game to determine a winner between you and her.
 ......She called it a confrontation between mystery and fantasy."
"But unfortunately, she has never called it an orthodox mystery.
 That means you have no guarantee that it follows the Decalogue."
"......But at the same time, Miss BEATRICE has said that this game is a contest between you and HER.
 ......That means there is room for you to achieve VICTORY."
"In other words,
 ...............you\'re trying to say that it\'s possible to deduce the solution?"
"......................................."
".........If you asked her that question, she would probably say that it is.
 ......However, just as she is the challenger and you are the challenged, the two of you are different creatures.
 ......Something Beato might have proposed thinking it is solvable...
may or may not be something that is solvable for you as well."
For example, let\'s say we pose a simple riddle that any Japanese person would be familiar with.
......However, if the person we\'re telling this riddle to is a foreigner with a Japanese‐English dictionary in their hand,
 it might be almost impossible to solve.
......In other words, it\'s possible to have a one‐sided "solvable problem",
 which might be easy for the questioner but extremely difficult for the person trying to solve it...
By the way, do you know of the foreign riddle:
 "Why do dragons sleep all day?"
The answer is:
 "Because they fight knights".
It\'s a riddle from the English realm, so it might be a little tough for a Japanese person.
"For that reason,
 .........I cannot promise that this tale is something you will definitely be able to solve.
 .........However, I can promise you one thing.
 ...I will guarantee it with the red truth."
".........What?"
"
Beato wanted you to solve it,
 so she created this game—
and the riddles of this tale—to be solvable.
 That alone, I will guarantee with the red truth."
It was...
...the one guarantee...
......that all those who try to use reasoning desire.
"I do not know whether the answer can be derived by following the Decalogue my father CREATED.
 ......However, if you run into a tight spot and want a compass for your reasoning,
 please try using my Decalogue if you REMEMBER.
 ......It might give you renewed courage and possibly even some new DISCOVERY......"
"Thank you.
 If I\'m truly stuck, I\'ll think about your fighting style.
 ......Are you sure it\'s alright to help out an enemy like this?"
"Pay that no MIND.
 I came to this tea party without a GIFT.
 I hope you enjoy this in place of a SNACK.
 ......And...if you come face to face with me AGAIN,
 there will probably be no time to speak of something so CASUALLY."
.........Knox\'s Decalogue...
...and VIRGILIA\'s red truth.
"
Beato wanted me to solve the riddles of this game,
 so she created them to be solvable."
In other words, ......Beato thinks I can solve it.
Isn\'t that......proof that it\'s possible to apply logic to this......?
......Of course, that\'s from Beato\'s point of view,
 ......and it doesn\'t necessarily mean that it\'ll be possible for me to work it out......
But compared to before now, when I didn\'t even know whether applying reasoning was possible or impossible,
 ......that one sentence might give me a great deal of courage and strength...
At least it has the power to silence any negative thoughts about it just being useless anyway...
"......Unless the other party assures you that it\'s possible to deduce the answer, you won\'t try.
 ......It\'s almost like love between shy, young people."
"Love?"
"Yes.
 .........Unless the other person first proves that they love you, you don\'t want to love them.
 ......Right?"
Both boys and girls......want to hear someone say "I love you" to them first without being prompted.
That\'s the dream.
......They don\'t want to love another person...
until they\'re sure that person will love them back.
After all, there\'s nothing as painful as a one‐sided love,
 ......and the emotional scars of a love that doesn\'t work out last a long time.
Because they\'re afraid of that pain,
 ......more than anything else, they want assurance that the other person will love them back...
"I SEE.
 That is an interesting way to explain the relationship between writer and reader in a detective NOVEL."
Yes,
 ......maybe you could liken detective novels to that.
Both the writer and the reader...
...first want the other party to tell them "I will solve it", or "It can be solved".
Until the writer is assured that readers will definitely attempt to solve their story, they don\'t want to write it.
The same goes for the readers.
Until they are assured that they will definitely be able to solve the story if they try, they don\'t want to read it.
Because they don\'t want to write what they consider a masterpiece and be hurt when no one reads it.
Because they don\'t want to apply logic to what they consider a masterpiece and be hurt when they realize it was all useless.
"By that argument...
......it really isn\'t a stretch to say it\'s like love between shy elementary or middle school‐aged kids.
 ......Even though they are interested, they don\'t have the courage to reveal their feelings,
 so they wait uncomfortably for the other person to confess......and by the time summer ends, nothing\'s happened."
"Heheh, sometimes they\'ll even hook up with a different person.
 That\'s what my first love was like, ihihi."
Along with these one‐sided feelings they can\'t express, they lament the passage of a summer which will never come again, and the days of their youth end.
The writer who wouldn\'t write until he gained the support of readers...goes for all eternity without releasing his maiden work.
The reader who waited for the writer\'s rise to fame...goes their whole life without knowing the joy of the mystery genre.
"......Battler‐kun.
 When does this "the chicken or the egg" type of shy love...
reach the level where it progresses into mutual love......?"
"Well, .........it\'s probably gradual over time.
 ...It starts as a relationship between friends, they communicate with each other more,
 ......and they start thinking "I like this person and I think they like me"...
...and when both of them reach the stage where they\'re no longer in doubt, then...
......well, I guess...they probably just naturally become a couple."
"The impression I\'ve gotten so far is that relationships which start with a sudden confession of love tend to break up more often,
 whereas couples who never actually confess to each other but realize that they\'ve always been together usually stay together for a surprisingly long time."
"In other words,
 it happens when a relationship of trust forms where each person trusts the other,
 ......is what you are SAYING."
".........Yeah, maybe.
 ......I\'m surprised.
 ...I always thought mysteries were a battle between the writer and the reader, ......but maybe they actually aren\'t."
"Yes.
 They can only exist if there is mutual trust,
 ......a relationship with love."
"................................."
"................................."
"......Then...you\'re saying that me and her...
...aren\'t in a battle to the death but a loving relationship?"
"......*giggle*.
 Though it doesn\'t look like anything more than a pair of elementary schoolers bullying each other to me...
 Heheheheh."
VIRGILIA joked at us in a middle‐aged‐woman sort of way.
Still, ......though I\'m not expecting friendship or a trusting relationship,
 ......I can accept her as a rival.
Beato is fighting at full force, trying to make me acknowledge that she\'s a witch.
And I\'m responding to that and going all out trying to deny that witches exist.
"You say that Miss Beato is fighting at full FORCE.
 How can you be so sure of THAT?"
"I mean, you can tell by looking, can\'t you?"
"It is not as though she has proclaimed in red that she was fighting you at full FORCE.
 ......And yet, you have no DOUBT?
 You are the one who said you would not believe anything except the red TRUTH."
".........ngh.................."
"*giggle*.
 ......This must be the stage where communication increases and you learn not to doubt your relationship,
 as you mentioned earlier."
VIRGILIA and Dlanor giggled together.
......One guy, multiple women.
 The topic is love.
......Wait a sec, isn\'t this the worst formation for getting made fun of?
I tried a couple of times to change the subject...
and clumsily brought up more refined topics in an attempt to return the mood to something more suitable for a tea party in the rainy Golden Land,
 but each time, VIRGILIA saw right through me and laughed at me......
..............................
Even amidst this, Beato kept looking downwards with those gray eyes,
 staring into her black tea.........
........................
.........Yeah, that\'s right......
VIRGILIA and Dlanor.........gave me so many hints back then...
And yet, I barely thought about them at all...
It\'s way too late now, but......
.........Let me think.
Now that it\'s too late to change anything and I have an endless amount of time on my hands, .........let me think.
......One more time, let me think about the red truth VIRGILIA gave me...
and the crutch called the Decalogue that Dlanor lent me......
With the red truth,
 .........VIRGILIA guaranteed that at the very least, Beato left enough room in this tale for me to achieve victory.
......That red truth guarantee...
...will give me the power to start my heart beating once again...
And......there\'s the crutch of the Decalogue, which Dlanor lent me.
Even she began by warning me that the Decalogue isn\'t so almighty that it can solve all riddles.
But even so, she kind of described it as a method to solve...
...no, to take on riddles.
......Let me try it.
Even though there\'s no guarantee whether this tale is mystery or fantasy,
 ......let me believe that I\'ll definitely be able to solve it,
 ......that it is a solvable tale,
 ......a mystery,
 ......and let me make one last attempt......
When I came to,
 ......I was suddenly...
...in that strange tea room,
 ......where I had often argued furiously with Beato across a table.
......Of course, Beato was nowhere to be found.
It was just me......isolated and alone.
That\'s alright.
 Even so, ......I won\'t stop thinking.
Okay then.
.........What were Knox\'s Commandments again......?
I\'m sure Dlanor explained most of them when slamming me with them.
Of course, even I recall them vaguely.
What was......the first one, again......?
"......I beg to inform you of the following.
 Knox\'s 1st:
 It is forbidden for the culprit to be anyone not mentioned in the early part of the story."
When I muttered about what the first one was...
.........Dlanor\'s subordinate appeared,
 ......as if in answer to my question.
Without bothering with an unnecessary "hello", she told me nothing more or less than what I wanted to know.
"......Yeah, that\'s it.
 The first commandment.
 ......The culprit has to be one of the people mentioned in the early part of the story."
.........Does that mean that by the end of the first game,
 ......the culprit must have appeared already......?
True, that is the most basic of basics in the mystery genre.
 A given.
......A given...?
......Have I really...
......kept that as a basic assumption......?
With each new game, the number of people in this tale keeps increasing.
That violates the closed circle rule.
From that moment onwards, everything is screwed up.
Did I give up on the inside,
 ......thinking that the true culprit or mastermind must not have shown up yet and that reasoning was therefore useless......?
If I read this tale as a fantasy,
 ......new characters keep showing up to the point where even having demon kings or gods or divine creators appear wouldn\'t be strange at all.
Even if the true mastermind first appeared in one of the last Episodes, I\'d just accept it as that kind of story.
However, ......if I read it as a mystery and stick with that conviction...
...then there\'s no need to worry at all about anyone who shows up later.
Because Knox\'s 1st clearly rules them out,
 stating that it\'s impossible for the culprit to be anyone who appears later on in the story.
............Of course, there\'s also what both Dlanor and VIRGILIA said.
There\'s no guarantee that this tale follows the rules of the Decalogue,
 so of course, I can\'t deny the possibility that the culprit first appeared in the second game or later.
However, ......this is one way of thinking.
This time...
...I\'ll forget about the Devil\'s Proof completely......and try to borrow the power of the Decalogue in my thinking.
After all, I know by now that I\'ll never be able to reach the truth without looking from multiple perspectives.
"In that case, .........that means the culprit in all of these repeating games...
is one of the 18 people.
 From the very beginning......there was no need for an illusion of a 19th person."
......Even the first of Knox\'s commandments...
...denies the existence of an unknown person known as the witch from the very start.
If I had followed that in the truest sense...
...I might not have suffered so miserably in the second game.
"......Knox\'s 2nd?"
"I beg to inform you of the following.
 Knox\'s 2nd:
 It is forbidden for supernatural agencies to be employed as a detective technique."
Dlanor\'s other subordinate appeared without a sound...and gave me an answer to my question.
......That\'s right.
 A detective can\'t go around using magic.
"So, ............
......if this is a fair battle,
 ......does that mean that, like the detective,
 ......the culprit also isn\'t allowed to use magic......?"
"I beg to inform you of the following.
 ......Know that the interpretation is up to you."
"Figures.
 ......Right.
 Then I\'ll interpret it my way."
If this game is a fair battle between me and Beato...
......then because this tale is solvable,
 it features no elements which are impossible to explain with logic.
In other words, magic cannot—must not—exist.
When it does appear, I shouldn\'t suspect that the mystery element is breaking down,
 ......but I should instead question why it was shown and suspect the witnesses and observers.
That\'s right,
 ......that was...
...Beato\'s greatest weapon in the second game.
Depictions of magic that have no place in a mystery.
By showing me that, she forced me to think that this tale wasn\'t a mystery,
 and therefore, that reasoning was impossible, ...and I surrendered......
However, if I had believed unshakably that it was a mystery...
......it would have been completely obvious to doubt the witnesses who claimed to have seen those things.
Also, at the end of the first game,
 it was revealed that this tale had been passed on to people in the future by means of a message bottle.
......Someone wrote down the incident...in the form of a story.
In other words, ......this entire story is a world which includes the personal opinions of an observer,
 namely, the person who wrote that message in a bottle.
In other words, the observer isn\'t God.
 It\'s a Human.
Therefore, there\'s no guarantee that the descriptions are truly impartial.
By the end of the first game,
 it had already been made clear that the text violated a constant premise of mystery stories:
 that they must be told from a God\'s‐eye view.
For that reason, it\'s possible to doubt not just the witnesses, but the observer as well.
If I could\'ve doubted this much,
 ......then no matter how many seemingly unsolvable displays of magic appeared,
 I wouldn\'t have had to blindly accept them and give up......
However, that raises the question:
 .........is it even possible to solve a story written by an observer who isn\'t impartial?
.........All reasoning ends here if you get obsessed with this.
That\'s why......it\'s so important for me to believe.
That Beato...
......is trying to fight me through this tale.
Because it\'s a fight,
 ......that means I\'ve been given a chance of winning.
And the fact that I\'ve been given that...
......must mean...
......that reasoning is possible.
......This part......is the hardest.
Unless I believe that the cruel witch took on the risk of losing to try and have a fair fight with me,
 ......I can\'t get past this part.
......VIRGILIA\'s right, ......it\'s just like love.
If I can\'t believe that Beato is fighting me head‐on with everything she\'s got,
 ......I won\'t be able to reason any further than this.
.........Alright, ...I\'ll admit it.
Unless I admit that we\'re "in love",
 ......I won\'t be able to get any further.
When VIRGILIA ran out of patience with the two of us, shy and incapable as we were of admitting that out loud,
 she gave me that red truth instead.
That was the red truth saying
 “
Beato wanted me to solve the riddles of this game, so she created them to be solvable”.
......What the hell is that?
It\'s like "Satou‐san in class A says he likes you~".
Like hearing a love confession via a friend...
.........I really am...
......pitiful.
Reasoning......is love.
If we don\'t love each other,
 ......the logic won\'t open up.
In that case, why can\'t we just say that we love each other?
"If you think you can solve it, just you try.""You\'re incompetent, like hell you can solve it."
......Yeah, according to George‐aniki, you call that sort of thing "tsundora".
Heheh, that brutal witch is finally starting to look a bit cute.
......If I meet her again, I wanna try saying "You\'re such a tsundora".
If I meet her again, ............somewhere...
.......................................
"......Tell me the other parts of the Decalogue.
 I don\'t care about the order.
 ......Give me something that seems useful."
"I beg to inform you of the following.
 Knox\'s 8th:
 It is forbidden for the case to be resolved with clues that are not presented."
"I beg to inform you of the following.
 Knox\'s 6th:
 It is forbidden for accident or unaccountable intuition to be employed as a detective technique."
It must not be solved with clues that aren\'t presented.
And it must not be solved by luck.
If this tale is made to be solvable...
then we can read this the opposite way.
In other words,
 ......clues must have been prepared so that the tale can be solved.
And it has to have been made in a way that it can be solved without relying on luck.
If I can believe strongly that Beato is challenging me to a fair game where reasoning is possible...
......I can be sure of that.
That must mean......that Beato has already concealed...
clues, hints, and messages within the tale so far.
......It isn\'t from the Decalogue, but Erika or someone said this:
There are three riddles to be exposed in a mystery.
One is the whodunit.
 Who is the culprit?
One is the howdunit.
 How did they commit the crime?
One is the whydunit.
 Why did they commit the crime?
All of this means that clues related to these three riddles are already present inside this tale.
......No, strictly speaking, it\'s like this:
......Beato scattered hints about because she wanted me to solve those three riddles.
Though whether I\'m capable of catching those hints or not is another matter...
Even if you pose a riddle thinking it\'s easy...it might be difficult for the person trying to solve it.
Therefore, it\'s only natural for there to be a difference in how difficult each person thinks it is.
.........That\'s why...
...as Beato went through each successive game, she watched me closely and tweaked the game as needed to get a good arrangement.
When Beato realized that I\'d completely surrendered in the second game because it was too hard,
 she secretly worried.
If I surrendered and lost the will to fight, ......the game would no longer remain on an even footing.
Therefore, in order to make me regain my will to fight,
 ......from the third game onwards, she set things up in a way that made it easier for me,
 giving me tips on how to fight and a few hints.
The appearance of VIRGILIA and Ronove was obviously so that they could help me.
Also, though we still had the usual crazy magic shows,
 she gave me the metaphor of the Braun tube trial, as well as tips on how to fight back.
I finally understood how to fight,
 .........and at the end of the fourth game...
......Beato managed to have the all‐out showdown with me that she had probably wanted most of all.
......Then, Beato acknowledged that my abilities had become full‐fledged,
 .........and entrusted me with her heart,
 ...............entrusted me with explaining this tale, didn\'t she...
In that case, ......it was really dumb of me to boycott most of the fifth game,
 just because I was so disgusted with those two witches...
It doesn\'t matter who the Game Master is.
All I need is to search for the truth in Beato\'s game.
......On the contrary, I should probably thank those two witches just a little,
 for continuing the game in Beato\'s place now that she\'s gone and left everything to me.
Of course,
 I doubt those evil witches were trying to do anything of the sort......
Culprit.
 Crime.
 Motive.
The answers, the hints, to those three ultimate riddles.........must be scattered throughout the tale shown so far.
It\'s probably a very faint light, ......like trying to find beads that have fallen onto a sandy beach.
They\'re definitely there.
......However, they\'re so faint that unless I believe strongly, there\'s no way I\'ll be able to find them.
"For your attention:
 I beg to state the following."
".........What is it......?"
"Go back......through the tale.
 ......Know that you have now been given eyes that will not miss the truth\'s faint light."
"............Now is the time...
............to go back......"
"Be advised that for reasoning to be possible, a trusting relationship is required."
"......Yeah,
 ......I know.
 .........In fact,
 ...I might have just realized at last."
It\'s something that has been repeated over and over again throughout the tale...
...persistently so.
"......Without love,
 ......the truth...cannot be ‘seen’......"
Slowly, the tea room dissolved into darkness......
Then, as though I was slowly sinking into a pitch black sea,
 .........I passed through the cracks of the long journey I\'d taken with Beato...
......and kept on falling and falling......
It was a bizarre experience......
like crossing over the boundary of sleep while still conscious.
The several tales that had come before became faint bubbles—no, perhaps small shining fragments—
that were scattered like stars in a pitch black sky.
I kept sinking on and on...
...into that sea......
The tales up until now...
......one after another...
......after another.........
Vergilius guided Dante to Mount Purgatory,
 ......and led him to Beatrice, the eternal lady who waited at the top.
Therefore,
 .........the innermost depths lay not at the bottom,
 .........but at the peak of Mount Purgatory.
The eternal lady...
...had been waiting there for Dante...
...the whole time......
And then.........I knew.
......I finally...reached the truth.........
.........In the depths, ...no,
 .........at the peak...of Mount Purgatory...............
............Idiot............
......You...
......really are...
...an idiot......
"...Ah,
 ......gwah...
.........that hurts........."
He woke from the sleep of death,
 ......and bit by bit......his sense of pain came back to him......
As Battler hung there pierced by the longsword, his head still tilted towards the heavens,
 ......life gradually returned to his face...through an expression of suffering......
"You...
......really are...
...an idiot......
 ......A huge idiot........."
Battler...noticed.
......The whole time,
 .........Beato had been snuggling up against him......sleeping.
And when he held her,
 .........he found...
......that it was not Beato...
......but her crumbling...
...remains.
And because her form was as fragile as ash,
 when Battler tried to hold it,
 .........just like a sandcastle made on a beach...
...being washed away by a small wave,
 ......it fell apart and lost its form......
At Battler\'s feet......lay nothing but the ragged remnants of Beato\'s dress......and a pile of ash.
No, ......on top of that pile of ash......he could see something sparkling gold.
......It was...
.........the husk...
...of a single gold butterfly...
...which had been torn to bits......
And so, .........Battler...
knew......
I......did reach the truth...
......But......I wasn\'t able to do it...
......while Beato...
......still remained in this world............
"......Beato......
......you...
......really are...
......an idiot......"
I finally reached the truth...
...of this ridiculous riddle...
...you created......
......Just...
...like you wanted......!
I didn\'t lose heart...
...and I finally...
...made it all the way to the end.........
So why...
......did you lose heart...
.........without waiting for me......?
......You believed so strongly, didn\'t you......?
 That I\'d......definitely reach the truth......
So, .........why.........?
Why...
............couldn\'t you believe with me...
.........and wait............?
It wasn\'t you who was forcing an endless torture on someone.
It was me...!
 I\'ve been the one putting you through a cruel torture...!
You resisted until the very end and kept on appealing to me......
 ........And now...
...even though I finally...
......reached the truth...
You...
......couldn\'t wait any longer...
......and it\'s all too late.........
"Y‐.........
...............you idiooooot.........
 ......Why......did you give in...
......before meeeeeee..."
It\'s my......fault......
 I forced her to endure this torture.
In fact, I\'m amazed she endured for so long......
She kept on appealing to me, over and over and over again,
 .........and because I was so incompetent......I couldn\'t even begin to understand the truth.
"Idiot......
......idiot.........
 ......Your riddles...
...were too damn twisted......!!
 ......Why couldn\'t...
...you say it...
.........more simply......?
 ...You fooooooooooooooooool!!
 Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaggghhhhh!!"
His scream of pain...
...filled...
......this cathedral of sorrow...
The sad witch who wasn\'t able to let Battler know of the truth.
The sad man who wasn\'t able to understand the witch\'s truth.
Battler howled in anger and sadness for both of them......
The clock hung in the cathedral showed that it was midnight on October 5th, 1986.
Time was up...
......for everything.........
If you\'re going to create a riddle as hard as this and be so proud of it,
 ...don\'t go and set a goddamned time limit on it......
".........No,
 ......I understand......
 Even though there was such a faint chance of that miracle happening,
 .........you prayed for it to happen......
 ......You\'re...
......just like Grandfather."
You prayed for and bet on the power of a miracle...
......one so unlikely that it was totally impossible, less likely than finding a bead you\'ve dropped on a sandy beach.........
And because you did...I have now arrived at that miracle.
But......your time...
...didn\'t last long enough............
If I had reached this point even a little sooner...
If I could have ‘seen’ the truth......!!
Even if it had been right before time was up,
 .........I might...
......have been able to save you...!!
But now, ......I\'ve been run through pathetically,
 ......and I can\'t......even hold what remains of you......!
......I struggled, attempting to pull the longsword out,
 ......or at least touch her remains by stretching out my arms......but neither worked.
"......Shiiiiiit......
dammiiiiiiiiiittt.........!!!"
.........At that time, I noticed a golden glint on the palm of my hand.
It was............a single wing from a gold butterfly.
That small fragment of gold...
......was the only piece of Beato...
...that I was permitted to touch.........
I cried with all my strength, .........gripped that fragment...and pressed it against my head, apologizing.
......Why couldn\'t I reach the truth earlier......?
Then I pressed it to my chest,
 ............promising that even though things had come to this,
 ......I would never again...
...lose...
...the truth......
When I pressed my hand against my chest, ......the sword piercing my chest cut my wrist, and blood dribbled out.
That blood spread throughout my fist...
......and it must have...
...soaked that gold fragment with my red blood.
It must have been......the only way of telling her...
...that I\'d found the truth she had wanted to tell me......
I clutched the wing of the gold butterfly...
...with my freshly bleeding hand...
......and pressed it against the red sword that impaled me......
In this moment,
 ......Ushiromiya Battler...knew.
 And understood.
......He had arrived...
......at the entirety...
...of this tale......
At that moment, ......it seemed as though a faint golden light...
...leaked out of the gaps in his clenched fist.
The two witches had their backs turned,
 and Erika was laughing at Battler\'s corpse.
"......What a disgrace you are, Battler‐san.
 Your foolishness will be immortalized in this statue......
 ..................Huh......?"
Just then, Battler\'s chest...
...no,
 .........the red longsword impaling Battler...
......began to shine gold from deep within his chest......
That bright golden light.........began to change the red sword\'s color...
...turning it gold......
"............What\'s going on......?"
"B‐......Battler is......
 ......What...
......is this......?!"
"..................!"
"Gwah...!!"
Battler coughed up blood and groaned.
His consciousness...came back.
 His will to live, his will to fight...came back...
The red longsword impaling Battler......could no longer be described as such.
...By now, it had become a golden longsword.
Then...
......slowly...
...slowly...
......it pulled itself out of Battler\'s chest......
After it had finally pulled itself out of Battler completely, it flipped through the air...
...and stuck upright into the ground in front of Battler\'s eyes, as though it knew who its master was.
Battler, crawling on the floor and moaning, grabbed the golden longsword...
...and though it looked painful,
 ......he slowly...
......rose to his feet once again.
"......This sure is an elaborate act.
 ...Is this one of your tricks, Lambda?"
"Th‐
.........that glow...
 ............I‐it can\'t be........."
Lambda stared wide‐eyed at that bright golden glow in awe...
Noticing that Battler\'s resurrection wasn\'t part of a script Lambda had thought up,
 Bern also frowned slightly...
"......Sorry. Retrials will not be permitted.
 Chiester Sisters, eliminate this resurrection illusion..."
"Understood, ma\'am.
 45, 410, firing permission granted."
"I‐......it\'s......unable to target!!
 IFF error, code 999...!"
".........Whoa."
"...Three Nines...?! Impossible...!"
The Chiester Sisters hesitated, unable to carry out BERNKASTEL\'s orders...
"Lambda, what kind of farce is this?
 ......The witch illusions have been completely destroyed, and the trial ended with our victory."
".........Sorry, Bern.
 ......You\'ll have to stick around a bit longer.
 .........Isn\'t that right, Ushiromiya Battler......?"
"...............Yeah.
 ......Sorry to keep you waiting, Erika,
 ......BERNKASTEL.
 ......Now it\'s time for my truth......"
"I accept your request for a retrial.
 ......The coven retracts the adjournment of the Court of Illusions!!"
"O‐objection.
 The trial has already been concluded and the verdict has been announced...!"
"Objection overruled...!!
 All verdicts are overshadowed by new truths!!"
"Objection!!
 Not only has Battler been banished as a player, he also doesn\'t hold the rank of witch...!
 He has no right to appeal...!"
"Objection overruled!!
 The thing is...he does now. Have that.
 ......I acknowledge it by the name of the Witch of Certainty, LAMBDADELTA...
 ......Ushiromiya Battler...!
 I acknowledge you as the new Golden Witch,
 ......no, .........as the new Endless Sorcerer, Ushiromiya Battler...!!!"
"......Wh‐
...what did you say......?
 ......B‐
......Battler got...
......the rank of a witch......?!"
The rank of a witch, which she had desired for so long, had been granted to Battler so quickly.
And on top of that, this wasn\'t anything temporary.
......This was an official, proper authorization by LAMBDADELTA.
Erika couldn\'t accept it, and her face turned bright red...
".........Hmph, ......hehehehehhahaahahahahahahaaah!!
 Looks like that kid\'s game really will keep us entertained until the very end...!
 Sure, I\'ll play along...!"
"ERIKA, accept his challenge...!
 The red truth you\'ve created with me is perfect...!
 The construction of truth which makes Natsuhi the culprit is perfect...!
 Battler will never be able to break it!"
"O‐of course, my master...!!
 There\'s no need to worry at all!
 Anyway, Chiester Sisters, my master ordered you to fire!
 How long is it going to take you to carry that order out?!"
"E‐error code 999!
 A‐an access code is required to target the territory lord...!"
".........Nyeh.
 I told you he\'d do it nyeh."
"Territory lord...?! Who is?!
 Who controls this fragment?!
 I do...!!"
".........Territory lord......
 ......You don\'t mean.........
......Battler is.........?"
"Yes.
 Ushiromiya Battler has been authorized as the official territory lord of this fragment, ma\'am...!"
"Yes, that\'s right.
 ......You still don\'t understand?
 You don\'t know what that golden glow signifies?
 .........Battler......has reached it.
 ......He\'s made his way to the innermost depths of all truths!!"
".........................................."
"That means Battler\'s understood everything about this world, this tale, this game.
 ......In other words, he\'s reached the position of the game\'s ruler.
 ......*giggle*, I\'ll bet you don\'t want to believe it, right, Bern?!"
"......Heh, .........*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*!!
 No, I don\'t want to believe it for a second...!!
 Alright, I\'ll test Battler to see whether he really understands everything...!!
 ERIKA!"
"Too bad, ERIKA.
 .........I know you were excited to be appointed as the territory lord of this fragment, but I\'m stripping you of that title."
"The new territory lord of this fragment is Ushiromiya Battler.
 ......*giggle*, is it awful? Tell me, tell me, don\'t you feel just awful?!
 How\'s it feel to have that title ripped away from you just when you\'d finally gotten it?! How\'s it feel?!"
"Ahh,
 ...waaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhggh!!"
"Battleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeer!!!
 You think you can disprove my theory?! I\'d like to see you tryyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy!!"
"It can\'t be done,
 it can\'t
 it can\'t
 it can\'t
 it can\'t
 it can\'t
 it can\'t
 it can\'t
 it can\'t
 it can\'t
 it can\'t
 it can\'t!!
 The theory I\'ve created has no holes!!
 It\'s impossible to rule out Natsuhi as the culprit!!"
".........
I can construct a theory with someone other than Aunt Natsuhi as the culprit.
 ......It may be that your truth is impossible to disprove.
 ......If so, that means your truth won\'t be able to deny my new truth either......!"
Battler spoke with the red truth allowed him by his status as a sorcerer.
"A......a culprit other than Natsuhi...?!
 ...H‐......hah!! And how?!!
 Dlanor!!
 Please entertain Battler‐san\'s delusional rambling...!!"
......Slowly, ......Dlanor stepped forwards.
In her hand......was the red longsword of the Decalogue.
 She also had a blue shortsword.
In Battler\'s hand......was the golden longsword.
......The two rivals once again...
......no, for the first time,
 ......they truly confronted each other.
".........Battler, I have been WAITING."
"Sorry to keep you."
"Not at ALL.
 Your return was sooner than I ANTICIPATED."
"Kill him,
 Dlanor A. Knoooooooooooxxxx!!!"
Dlanor\'s form disappeared in an instant.
As though her slow, dignified movements from before were only a lie...!
......The trail drawn by the longsword of red truth burned itself into the retinas of those who saw it.
Before anyone had enough time to follow that trail, ......it was already approaching Battler\'s chest...!
"
Lady ERIKA\'s reasoning has solved the fifth GAME.
 No new facts exist to overturn this logically derived TRUTH...!!"
"
It\'s possible to present a different truth using a different interpretation!!
 When multiple truths exist in parallel, the authenticity of both is questioned!!"
In this closed‐off world, it\'s possible for differing truths to exist at the same time.
Furthermore, as long as multiple truths exist, it\'s impossible to claim that any of the truths are the single truth.
In other words, even if I can\'t overturn Erika\'s reasoning, by questioning its credibility...
......and conquering it, I can defeat it...!
"Bern\'s reasoning is perfect. You won\'t be able to overturn it easily.
 ......But still.
 If you can present a theory on par with Bern\'s, the fight will come down to a verdict.
 That means it\'s possible that either one of the truths will be defeated and denied!"
".........This plot twist is truly laughable...!!
 I\'d expect nothing less from a demon\'s script!!"
"Then let me ASK!!
 If not Natsuhi, who do you theorize is the CULPRIT?!!"
Battler\'s golden longsword drew both red and blue trails at will.
"
It\'s possible to construct a theory in which this was the revenge of the baby from 19 years ago mentioned by Aunt Natsuhi in her confession."
"
Knox\'s 1st:
 It is forbidden for the culprit to be anyone not mentioned in the early part of the STORY!
 A person first introduced in the fifth game cannot be named as the CULPRIT...!!"
"
What if the baby from 19 years ago was among us since the very beginning?
 For example, ......what if it was me?!"
"
Knox\'s 8th:
 It is forbidden for the case to be resolved with clues that are not PRESENTED!
 Was there ever any foreshadowing showing that you might be the baby from 19 years AGO?!!"
"
The red truth from the fourth game that I am not the son of my mother Asumu.
 The feeling that Dad was hiding something in both the first game and this game.
 In particular, in this game, it was made clear that there were some special circumstances having to do with my birth."
Battler proposed that he might be the baby from 19 years ago,
 ......and announced that he would reconstruct the crime with himself as the culprit.
As Dlanor cautiously held her sword at the ready, she gauged the distance between them...
Now that Battler had inherited the position of this world\'s territory lord and even attained the rank of Endless Sorcerer,
 his movements surpassed Human understanding.
By now, the physical distance between them probably counted for nothing.
Because their extremely agile battle was surpassing the point where the concept of distance made any difference.
"......A good START.
 Let us hear......your theory with Battler as the CULPRIT...!"
"Yeah, I\'ll let you hear it.
 I\'ll prove that this explanation also works,
 ......and that you can\'t be certain Aunt Natsuhi is the culprit...!"
"<Good>!!
 If you\'re supposed to be the culprit, that creates several contradictions!
 I\'ll use those contradictions to reap your feeble truth!
 I, Furudo ERIKA, the detective and the Witch of Truth...!!"
This time, Erika stepped forward.
......In her hand, there appeared a scythe like one a grim reaper might hold.
A ruthless scythe for reaping everything that threatened her theory...!
"
It\'s only possible for the crimes to have taken place during the single hour after midnight!!
During that one hour, you were in the dining hall of the mansion!!
Therefore, it was impossible for you to commit the crimes!"
"
It has not been specified that the time of death was during the single hour after midnight.
Therefore, it\'s possible that the crimes didn\'t occur between midnight and 1 a.m....!"
"I\'ll speak exclusively about the murders in the cousins\' room!
It is impossible for the crime to have been committed in the cousins\' room between 1 a.m. and the time of the crime\'s discovery!!"
"Dlanor, now!!!"
"
Knox\'s 8th:
 It is forbidden for the case to be resolved with clues that are not PRESENTED.
 If the crime actually was carried out in the cousins\' room, clues must have been SHOWN.
 Because clues were not given to the detective, Lady ERIKA, who was on the watch for any abnormalities inside that room until morning, such a crime is IMPOSSIBLE...!!"
"
The "time of the crime\'s discovery" refers to the point at which I let out a scream and everyone gathered there.
 Even if it was impossible to kill them before that point, it was possible to kill them afterwards...!!"
Battler used a blue flash to deflect both of the red truths that Erika and Dlanor had flung at him...!
Erika\'s eyes went wide.
 After all, what he had said was completely absurd.
......At that time,
 ......they still hadn\'t been killed...?!
Even though corpses were lying there with their necks sliced open?!
"
The deaths of the four in the cousins\' room have been declared with the red truth!!
 Are you trying to use a witch illusion?!
 Are you trying to resurrect George and the others using the concept of magic even though they were dead at the time?!"
"I see, since you believe they were dead by that point,
 it must look to you as though the dead are being brought back to life...!
 So this will probably be magic to you."
".........In that case, I won\'t be the one to take the next shot at you!"
"Shut it!!
 How often do I have to say it?!!"
"
The deaths of the four in the cousins\' room have been declared with the red truth!!
 And their dead bodies were witnessed by a large number of people!!
 And it\'s already been declared with the red truth that no examination of any corpse is ever mistaken...!!"
"Take that, dead people!!!"
"
......To what point in time did that red truth refer?
 Have you forgotten, Miss?"
The fierce shower of red was blocked by a magical barrier set up by Ronove, who suddenly appeared right in front of Battler.
Now that Beato was gone, the demons shouldn\'t have been able to manifest themselves in the real world...
However, ......he "existed" here,
 ......and calmly dealt with Erika\'s attack.
"Y‐...you, ......Ronove!!
 H‐how did you get here...?!
 Well, who cares, this all works out nicely. Now there\'s no need to go looking for you.
 I\'ll capture you here and deny your existence too!!"
".........I\'ll leave it to you.
 Teach her that you can\'t control everything with a single, arrogant truth."
"<Yes, Your Majesty>.
 .........Well then, ...allow me to spar with you for a while.
 Go ahead, Miss."
"
The red truth pronouncing them dead referred to what point in time, then, according to you?!
 Are you saying you can pinpoint that?!
 You can\'t pinpoint it, so you can\'t disprove that it declared them dead at the time of the crime\'s discovery!!"
"
When this court was opened, Lady LAMBDADELTA made a proclamation.
 She said this was a 24:00 answer session!
......They were pronounced dead at 24:00 on the second day, in other words, at the end of the game.
 That does not deny the possibility that the murder occurred after the morning of the second day, after the so‐called "discovery of the crime"...!"
"Then, you\'re saying......that the victims were alive at that time?!
 Even though their necks were sliced open?!"
"
Did you see that yourself, Miss Detective...?
 True, it has been said that no examination of any corpse is ever mistaken no matter who performs it,
 ......but it has never been said that there was a rule against describing something other than a corpse as a corpse."
Erika swung her scythe recklessly,
 but Ronove blocked everything with elegant gestures made with the shield on one of his hands.
"S‐......so, at that point in time, no one was dead?!
 Are you telling me...there weren\'t even wounds on their necks?!
 But...in that case...why did Battler scream?!"
"Never leave your feet unprotected, little girl.
.........Ushiromiya Kinzo is already dead at the starting time for all games!"
"Huh?! Ah—"
A pitch black hole opened beneath Erika\'s feet and swallowed her up.
She could probably see through to the other side of the hole.
......It was the same thing you\'d see if you looked down through the skylight on the ceiling of this cathedral.
"Lia!!"
"Yes."
VIRGILIA could already be seen in midair inside the cathedral.
As Erika fell from the heavens, VIRGILIA was right below her and thrust upwards with her divine spear glowing blue!
"
......Shouldn\'t you rethink your reasoning?
 Kinzo doesn\'t exist.
 Therefore, the way for the bodies to disappear in your theory breaks down."
"CORRECT.
 ......Unless someone other than Kinzo makes the corpses disappear, your theory UNRAVELS."
"Geh...
......gah...
......gammiiiiiiit, this is nothing...
......graggh...gah.........!!"
VIRGILIA\'s blue divine spear skewered and pinned Erika in midair.
Erika struggled, filled with hatred, but she couldn\'t get it out easily.
Then, all around her,
 ......several small, fast things clanged off the walls and surrounded her.
Seven people manifested at once.
"We are the Seven Sisters of Purgatory...!!
 Know this, foe of our master!!"
"......You.........lowly paperweights.........!!"
"
After George\'s death, his body was never moved!"
"
After Jessica\'s death, her body was never moved!"
"
After Maria\'s death, her body was never moved!"
"
After Rosa\'s death, her body was never moved!"
"
After Genji\'s death, his body was never moved!"
"
After Krauss\'s death, his body was never moved!"
"
Therefore, the bodies couldn\'t have vanished after being discovered!!
 Your theory about Kinzo carrying the bodies away breaks down!"
"AAAaaaaaarrggghhhhhhhghhh...!!!
 And so what?!
 Even without Kinzo, I can explain how......the corpses disa—......
......nnngg, ......gaaaaaaaaaggghhh!!
 I...have to revise my theory......?!
 Nnnnnngggaaaaaaaaaarrrrggghh!!
 Me?! ...The detective?!!"
"Gaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarrggghhhhh!!"
......Even with Kinzo\'s existence denied,
 Erika was probably capable of escaping this pin by making only a small revision to her theory.
However,
 ......to her, having to revise a theory she had already created...
.........was extremely......humiliating!
"Looks like you toyed around with your plan too much in order to corner Natsuhi like that."
"You played around too much with your reasoning.
 ......At this point, your master isn\'t the only one who can speak of Kinzo\'s death with the red truth."
"This is what you get for playing around in the witches\' darkness.
 ......Know that, Furudo Erika...!"
"Nngh, ......gggh, ggh.........!!"
Of course, even Erika had doubted Kinzo\'s existence from the beginning.
However, in the trial that had taken place before,
 no one except BERNKASTEL, as well as LAMBDADELTA who was going along with her, had been capable of denying Kinzo\'s existence.
And because of the willful silence of those two, she had been free to shape the truth about Kinzo in any way she desired.
She never expected that Battler......would become a witch......a sorcerer,
 capable of using red without proof!!
However, she had her own Inquisitor who could also use red without proof to counter!!
"D‐Dlanoooooooooooorrrr!!!!"
"
Knox\'s 2nd!!
 It is forbidden for supernatural agencies to be employed as a detective TECHNIQUE!
 If you intend on showing that Kinzo has died with the red truth, I demand that you present evidence of a Human truth supporting such a STATEMENT...!"
"......Forgive me, you crazy old bastard."
"Go forth, Battler.
 Step over my dead body...!!"
"
Presentation of evidence.
 I present a body which can be identified as Ushiromiya Kinzo...!!"
"
Can you prove that this is Ushiromiya Kinzo\'s BODY?!
 No matter how much it resembles him, unless you can prove that it is him,
 it is possible to claim that it is a substitute corpse from someone ELSE!!
 Can you show that it is Kinzo\'s body with Human truth ALONE?!
 In this one case, I will treat any rebuttal that uses only the red truth as INVALID...!!"
"......Ooh.
 Any counter with the red truth will be invalid?
 That\'s novel."
"It may be true that the existence of third‐party corpses has already been denied with the red.
 However, if saying that in red is forbidden,
 ......*giggle*, Battler has nowhere to run to.
 Heheheheheheheheheh!"
"That\'s right......
In this closed‐off Rokkenjima, there is no objective way to show that this corpse is Grandfather\'s."
"
And that itself suggests the possibility that this corpse is a body DOUBLE!
 This unidentifiable body cannot serve as proof of Kinzo\'s DEATH...!!"
"
......Checkmate...!!
 My theory is rock solid!!"
Dlanor had sealed off the red truth as a means of proving that Kinzo\'s corpse had been shown.
......Even with the power of witches, Battler couldn\'t argue back......!
".........How are you going to prove that the corpse is Kinzo\'s if the red truth is sealed?
 It\'s impossible.
 ...It can\'t be done...!"
"......Not with red or blue, ...right......?"
"
I guarantee that this is the corpse of Ushiromiya Kinzo...!!"
Then,
 ...when Dlanor...
...met with Battler\'s golden flash,
 .........she was unable to fully block it with either her red longsword or her blue shortsword,
 ...and she was blown backwards into the air...!
It was a direct hit......without any miscalculation.
Though she had always seemed as firm as a small giant before now,
 she was finally blasted away and slammed against the wall as though she was the slender girl she appeared to be...!
"D‐......Dlanor?! Wh‐what are you......"
"......A splendid gold TRUTH.
 .........It is VALID."
"......G‐......gold truth......?!"
The golden longsword, which had been drawing red and blue trails before now,
 finally drew a trail which retained its divine golden color.
The truth it showed.........was neither red nor blue.
.........It was gold...truth...!!!
"Wh‐what is that...?
 Lambda, does this follow the rules?!"
".....................
 ......Yes.
 ......Gold truth, valid.
 The gold truth...
......can only be used by the territory lord of this world...
...no, ......only by the Game Master himself!!"
"Wh‐......what did you say............?"
"......Gold TRUTH.
 A divine truth woven in a different fashion than the red TRUTH.
 ......Its strength is on par with the red TRUTH.
 ......It may sometimes be INFERIOR.
 But it is sometimes SUPERIOR!!"
"That brilliant shine......is the proof that Battler‐kun has truly understood Beato."
".........I\'ve shown it.
 Shown that the corpse is Grandfather\'s."
"YES.
 Gold truth, ......ACCEPTED.
 Unless Lady ERIKA\'s theory undergoes some revision, it will be DESTROYED...!"
"Wh‐......what the......
ah, aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarrrghhh!!!"
Erika cried out in pain.
 ......It wasn\'t the pain of her body being impaled.
It was the pain of her own theory being defiled...!
".........I see.
 ......I thought this was nothing but a mishmash of narrative tricks...
 ......Just when did it become........................
 .........*giggle*giggle*,
 ahhahahahaahahahahhaahahahahhahah!!
 What a crazy string of great works!!"
"Battler, it would be beyond boorish to say more.
 Even without saying another word,
 you\'ve made your truth about the corpses\' disappearance fully "understood"!"
"Yes, what you\'re thinking of doesn\'t conflict with any of the red in this trial so far!
 I completely understand and accept your truth based around the revenge of the man from 19 years ago!!
 I proclaim your truth established!!"
"Wha.
 What the...?!
 Why is that, Great Lady LAMBDADELTA?!!
 He still hasn\'t explained everything...!!
 I still have many ways to argue back, ......like Hideyoshi\'s locked room, the seal on Natsuhi\'s room and the button in the closet!"
"......Uh.
 ......You still think it\'s possible for you to argue back against Battler...........?"
"Ggah, ......gwwaagghgghggghhh.........!!!!"
Only Erika, the one who was supposedly so intelligent, couldn\'t understand.
......She couldn\'t understand that Battler had already found the real truth.
"
Grandfather\'s absence has therefore been proven,
 and the dishonorable relationship between Aunt Natsuhi and Grandfather has been removed from consideration!!"
"
Aunt Natsuhi is pure and faithful!
 I won\'t permit this vulgar tale you\'re all so fond of!!"
".........B‐.........Battler‐kun......!!"
"
Furthermore.
 Because doubts have been raised about the time of death for all who have died so far, the alibis for everyone besides Aunt Natsuhi are null and void...!!"
"
The argument that the crimes couldn\'t have been committed by anyone except Aunt Natsuhi no longer stands!!"
Dlanor, who must have risen to her knees at some point,
 slowly stood up......
The flash from the golden longsword was still carved deep into her chest.
Though pain didn\'t show in her expression,
 her awkward movements clearly showed how serious the damage she had taken was.
Even though she herself knew that this spelled the total end of the match...
...Dlanor didn\'t abandon her duty...!
"
However, in the cousins\' room, you witnessed dead bodies which were impossible to MISIDENTIFY...!
 Are you trying to say that was a FALSEHOOD?!
 ...Knox\'s 7th: It is forbidden for the detective to be the CULPRIT!!
 The detective is obligated to have an objective point of VIEW.
 Your theory violates this OBLIGATION!!"
"
Furudo Erika is the detective in this game, not me!!
 And by Knox\'s 9th, observers are permitted to put forward their own conclusions and interpretations...!!"
"
Knox\'s 8th: It is forbidden for the case to be resolved with clues that are not PRESENTED!
 Until now, you have been the DETECTIVE!
 Was it ever shown that you were not the detective this time, and that you were an observer with a subjective VIEWPOINT?!!
 Unless it was, you do not have the right to falsify your point of VIEW!!"
"
In this game,
 when I figured out the device of the epitaph\'s riddle, I witnessed Grandfather.
 ......As has already been shown in red, Grandfather doesn\'t exist.
 It was impossible for me to witness him!
 Therefore, it has already been shown that my viewpoint wasn\'t objective!!"
"
It is possible that it was just a sheet or something fluttering in the wind and rain which you mistook for Kinzo.
 It cannot be used as foreshadowing to form a basis for Knox\'s 9th...!!
 Mistaking things for something else is a right permitted to all observers!!"
"
There\'s the red truth which Beato showed during the fourth game!!
 No person would mistake Ushiromiya Kinzo by sight!"
It\'s the red truth Beato used to counter my blue truth claim that someone disguised themselves as Grandfather...
and thereby made it seem as though he had appeared.
In other words, on this island, anything which might lead someone to visually mistake something for Grandfather, including someone else pretending to be Grandfather, cannot ever work.
The scheme Aunt Natsuhi once put together to make it seem as though Grandfather was alive...
only involved her saying things like "he was here just a second ago" or "he\'s in his study alone now",
 cleverly exploiting the relatives\' blind spots to pretend he was there.
She never tried to make anyone mistake something they saw for Grandfather himself,
 so there are no contradictions.
If she had tried to dress one of the servants in Grandfather\'s robe...
it would probably have been seen through in an instant......
It has been guaranteed that none of the characters in this tale...
would "mistake something for Grandfather by sight"...!
If someone still claims to have seen Grandfather, it becomes a "falsehood".
Everyone is permitted the right to falsify their observations...
...but there is one person who does not have that right.
And that person is...
“the detective”...!!
"
Because of the right granted by Knox\'s 9th, everyone is allowed to mistake a sheet in the wind for something else and talk mistakenly about what they saw.
 ......However!
 Mistaking it for Grandfather in particular is not permitted in this game due to the red truth!!"
"......So, once you claimed to have seen Kinzo,
 it was no longer misrecognition...
but INTENTIONAL.
 ......In other words, this disproves the objectivity of your viewpoint...
...is what you are SAYING......?"
In this case, unintentional misrecognition is not permitted by the rules of this game.
However, it is possible to intentionally lie about seeing something you never saw...!!
And that is an action not permitted to a "detective" burdened with the responsibility of an impartial perspective......
"Forgive my crazy argument...
 This is the end."
"No, it is ALRIGHT."
............If a man like you had been in the WORLD,
you would surely have protected the fragile truth from any kind of ARROGANCE.
Faced with the tyranny of a single plausible truth claiming to be the sole truth and exterminating all the fragile others,
 ......you would surely have protected the real TRUTH...!!
Battler\'s golden longsword.........drew a massive blue arc as though splitting the heavens.
"I am glad to have been able to fight with YOU...!!"
"
Therefore,
 my perspective in this particular game is based upon the ninth commandment, not the seventh...!!
 The fact that I claimed to have seen Grandfather is proooooooooooof!!!"
......The noise which rang out across the cathedral...
......was the sound of Dlanor\'s longsword clattering to the floor.
Simply letting go of that was the same as resigning to the proud Dlanor.
Though the blue trail Battler had drawn was aiming right for the top of Dlanor\'s head, .........it stopped a hair\'s breadth away.........
If it hadn\'t, Dlanor would probably have been annihilated without leaving a single scrap of flesh behind.
".........I RESIGN.
 ......I give up on denying your TRUTH..."
"I\'ve paid my debt.
 ......My respect goes to your father.
 ......The Decalogue was neither arrogant nor judgmental...!"
"R‐......respect to...my FATHER........."
Dlanor......sat down on the floor...
...and completely abandoned her will to fight.
"Wh‐......what are you doing, Dlanor?!!
 Shameful, pathetic!!
 You stupid half‐wit murder doll!!
 You\'ve tainted the honor of your own father, shame on you!!
 You still call yourself mystery\'s wedges?!
 You\'re surrendering to magic?!
 The history of the mystery genre forbids it!!"
".........You\'re the one...
...who doesn\'t understand a thing about mysteries.
 ......If you see mysteries as nothing more than a weapon with which to sneer at your opponent intellectually,
 ......I won\'t let you ever speak of them again!!"
"......B‐.........Battleeeeeeeeeer......!!!"
"
I present a truth that conflicts with yours!!
 Aunt Natsuhi was threatened by a phone call over the internal line made by the man from 19 years ago: me!"
"
His goal was to make Aunt Natsuhi look like a murderer...!!
 From the beginning, this has all been a drama of revenge intent on framing Aunt Natsuhi...!!"
"
Th‐that\'s wrong, it\'s a drama of revenge against the Ushiromiya family planned by Natsuhi!!
 Your theory outright opposes mine!!"
"......Can you still not pull out the blue spear that\'s sticking through you?"
"Yep, good point.
 Erika, you haven\'t given me a single way for the corpses to disappear that doesn\'t involve Kinzo.
 Your theory is being denied as I speak...tick tock!"
"Th‐this spear is just...
............ugh, ......gaaaaahh......!!
 You paperweights...
...get out of my way.........!"
......The deeply piercing blue spear and the seven red stakes tormented her theory.
They won\'t come out......... They won\'t come out.........!!
"...............I acknowledge the mistakes in Erika\'s reasoning and the need for revision."
"Wh‐......what the......my master?!?!"
Watching Erika\'s face contort with pain as she struggled to escape from the spear,
 BERNKASTEL declared this with a disgusted expression.
For all intents and purposes, ...it was as if BERNKASTEL had acknowledged Erika\'s defeat herself.
With eyes of shock and despair, Erika looked up at the master who no longer had any confidence in her victory...
"......I don\'t give a damn about your pride.
 How long do you intend to shame yourself like that?
 ......You, my double who\'s been granted the same blue hair as me, ......how long do you intend to hang there pierced through like that......?
 Do I really have to descend myself......?"
".........I\'ve changed my mind, having a piece is a waste of time.
 Aah, what a pain, what a pain, what a total pain...
 Who needs a piece, I should just get rid of it... Ahh, what a terrible regretful discouraging disappointing misguided mistake...!!
 ......Get on with it, you filth!!
 Didn\'t I tell you to revise your pathetic attempt at reasoning?!?!"
"Ooh, ......agh...hh.........y‐yes, my master...!!
 I\'ll revise it... I\'ll revise my theory...!!
 Uuuuuuughhuuuhhhuuuu......!!"
As Erika\'s face twisted in humiliation and tears streamed from her eyes,
 she withdrew and revised her own theory in accordance with her master\'s order......
Mumbling quietly, she made various revisions with the blue truth,
 had them acknowledged by LAMBDADELTA, and finally had the blue spear smashed and was freed......
Though that blue truth did indeed explain how the bodies had disappeared,
 ......it was truly shabby reasoning that reeked of desperation.
".........My master......
 .........I, ......I\'ve taken it out.........
 ...My theory...
......is perfect......"
"Are you kidding me?
 It\'s woefully pathetic.
 .........But I\'ll forgive you.
 Because your face and your theory are both so shameful it\'s funny!
 *snicker*snicker*snicker*snicker*snicker*!!!"
Erika was taunted by her master, who wore an ugly expression.
She thrashed about on the floor, crying bitter tears.
The wounded Dlanor stepped out before her, as though shielding her, and she spoke to BERNKASTEL, as well as Battler.
"......Regardless of how shabby it might be,
 ......Lady ERIKA\'s revised truth is VALID."
"Yeah, that\'s right.
 Regardless of my truth, yours can exist at the same time.
 ......That\'s what this world is like.
 No one can disprove them, so even if there are various truths and even if they contradict each other wildly, they can exist at the same time.
 Here, as many truths exist as you can imagine.
 No one can unilaterally deny them...!"
"Yes, that is TRUE.
 ......I will not allow anyone to deny Lady ERIKA\'s TRUTH."
"D‐......Dlanor........."
"As long as I am here,
 I will protect that TRUTH.
 ......No matter how shabby it might be, I will not laugh at that TRUTH."
"Uugh......uuuuughhhuuuuuu!!"
......The words of Dlanor, whom Erika had previously looked down upon, led Erika to once again thrash about on the floor, sobbing.
"And...
because no unique truth exists, everything is covered in darkness.
 ......Therefore,
 although both my theory and Erika\'s are impossible to deny, neither is the single truth.
 They are uncertain things, neither of which can be denied, and neither of which is absolute...!!"
"And as long as there\'s no definite answer, the witch illusion still exists.
 .........It isn\'t Erika who\'s allowed to expose that, and it isn\'t any of the rest of you, either.
 ......It\'s me alone!
 I won\'t let anyone expose BEATRICE\'s illusion except me!!!"
"The verdict is revised...!!
 Because of the truth presented by Ushiromiya Battler, Erika\'s truth is no longer unique!
 However, Erika\'s truth is impossible to disprove!
 Therefore, both of their truths exist together!
 The conclusion of the fifth game is rescinded!"
"The game goes back to being even!!
 And I transfer the position of Game Master from myself to the Golden Sorcerer, Ushiromiya Battler!!"
"Ushiromiya Battler, step forward!!
 I appoint you as the new Game Master!!
 Will you accept?
 You will, right?!
 Do it, you new Endless Witch!!!"
"Yeah!!
 I\'m the new Game Master!!
 I\'ll weave the sixth game...!!"
"Erika, let\'s settle things for good this time!!
 Stand up!!"
"......Y‐......yes,
 ......you bet I\'ll stand......
 ......You will rue...
...giving me a chance to recover from this humiliation......!!!
 My master, please give me an opportunity to fight with Battler again in the sixth game!!"
"............Sure.
 Of course I\'ll give you a chance."
"Wow, incredible.
 For you to "give someone a chance".
 Isn\'t this a miracle? Witch of Miracles, BERNKASTEL."
".........Erika.
 You\'ve miraculously managed to escape with your life.
 ......In the sixth game, ...Battler\'s game,
 .........you had better expose the truth no matter what...
 Unless you want to be tossed aside into the darkness of oblivion!!"
"Y‐yes, my master...!!!
 .........D‐......Dlanor..."
"Of COURSE.
 I will give it my all in the next game as WELL."
"Heh, ......heheheheheheh!!
 I won\'t pretend to be a guest any longer.
 ......Together with Dlanor, I\'ll tear your game to bits!!"
"Sure.
 I\'ll invite you to my sixth game...!!
 Sorry, but that title of yours...<Checkmate of the>...isn\'t cutting it."
"It\'s your game. You can decide the name yourself!
 Just bring it on...!!
 I, Furudo Erika, ............am a detective before I am a witch!!
"
"I acknowledge you as the new master of this game, ......and I declare war!!
 I swear......I swear I\'ll expose everything you try to hide!! I\'ll kill you!!
 Golden Sorcerer, Ushiromiya Battler!!!"
"Yeah, come at me with all you\'ve got!!
 Furudo Erikaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!"
Just watch, Beato.
 ......I\'ll take charge of your game!!
And in this next game, I\'ll prove that I completely understand all of your riddles...!!
