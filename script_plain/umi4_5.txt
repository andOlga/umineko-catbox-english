The door was forcefully flung open, and Rosa flew in with Maria.
"Is Genji‐san or anyone here...?!
 It doesn\'t matter who, someone bring us a bath towel...!!"
It was already a full‐blown typhoon outside, and it was starting to pour down hard.
Though she had at least been using an umbrella, Maria had been in the rose garden amid all that wind and rain the whole time.
She had grown ice‐cold.
Maria had gotten into a minor fight with Rosa in the rose garden, and had been told to stay there forever.
......She had done as she was told, and had continued to remain in that spot even after the rain started.
Rosa certainly had gotten a little emotional and angry,
 but Maria\'s stubborn demands were probably more at fault.
......The cousins, who had unfortunately been witness to that exchange,
 were relieved to see the mother and child close to each other again.
Rosa towelled Maria\'s head dry.
 She seemed overcome with worry that Maria might catch a cold, but Maria herself was nonchalant.
"Are you alright?
 You didn\'t catch a chill, did you?
 Maybe we really should go back quickly and get a change of clothes..."
"Uu, I\'m fiiiine!
 And I\'m hungry, so food is better than change of clothes, uu!"
"Hahahaha.
 She seems fine, Auntie Rosa.
 She\'s gotta be alright if she\'s got that much bounce."
"It\'s a really good thing she had an umbrella.
 ......I was thinking she might be soaked to the bone.
 The fact that she was holding on to an umbrella is one consolation, at least."
"But Maria!
 Even if you\'ve got an umbrella, you have to get some shelter if it starts pelting down like this, got it?
 Little girls shouldn\'t ever let themselves get cold."
".........Uu."
"It\'s alright, Jessica‐chan.
 ......It\'s Mama\'s fault for telling her to stay there.
 I\'m really sorry, I\'m really sorry...!!"
"Uu!
 I\'m a good girl?
 Good girl for doing what Mama said?
 Stayed there even though it was cold, stayed there until Mama came!
 Uu‐uu!"
"Yes, you really are a good girl, Maria.
 You did exactly what Mama told you...
 You really did well.
 But next time, even if Mama tells you to do something, you find some shelter if it starts raining like that.
 Alright...?
 Promise Mama."
"Uu.
 Promise Mama.
 ......Uu☆"
As Rosa gently held Maria, they joined their pinkies together and promised.
Battler and the others could tell that by this bonding between mother and child, expressed through a single little finger,
 the warmth was starting to return to Maria\'s body.
"Kanon‐kun, thanks for the towel.
 That really helped."
"......Then, if you would excuse me."
Kanon bowed with a blank expression, as though he had done nothing that required gratitude, then left the parlor.
"......Alright, it\'s already dinnertime.
 Let\'s all go together.
 ......Maria, you can even have half of my dessert too for being so good."
"Uu!
 Really, Mama?!
 Uu‐uu, get dessert, uu‐uu‐uu♪
 Love you Mama, love you Mama!"
"Now now, Maria, don\'t jump around.
 Mama loves you too, Maria.
 Love you Maria, love you Maria."
"Me too, love you Mama, love you Mama!
 Uu‐uu‐uu‐uu!"
"Uu‐uu‐uu‐uu♪"
Rosa and Maria looked really happy together.
 Even the cousins watching started to feel a somehow familiar warmth filling up their chests.
"......You know, that might be the age when you\'re on the best terms with your parents."
"It wasn\'t like that for me.
 Like Mom and stuff, always yelling at me to study, study, study."
"That\'s because they love their children.
 A parent\'s love isn\'t always gentle and indulgent.
 My mother was strict with me too, but by now I realize that it was because she treasured me so."
"Uu‐uu‐uu!
 Love you Mama, love you Mama!"
"Love you Maria, love you Maria♪ So, shall we get some food?
 Let\'s be friends and hold hands."
"Uu!
 Be friends and hold hands!
 Mama and Maria, friendly friendly♪"
"Yes, that\'s right.
 Mama and Maria are friends.
 Forever and ever.
 I love you, Maria..."
"...............The hell was that?
 ...What happened?"
The sudden sound had come from the teacup Gretel had been holding, which had fallen and smashed.
".........Sorry.
 I was out of it for a moment.
 Sorry for dropping it."
The cup on the floor was broken into tiny pieces.
......Would it really have made such a sound and smashed into so many pieces just by being dropped from that height?
Even someone as obtuse as Battler could realize that she was in a bad mood over something,
 but he couldn\'t understand why she had suddenly grown so displeased.
When she made to bend over and pick up the pieces of the cup, Ronove appeared out of nowhere and stopped her.
"Please, you will injure yourself.
 Leave the cleaning‐up to me.
 Shall I bring you another cup...?"
"......No thanks.
 .........I guess a demon\'s black tea just doesn\'t suit my tastes."
"Hoh.
 To think that there is someone whose tastes aren\'t satisfied even by Ronove\'s tea.
 I must respect your discerning palate."
".........I\'m getting bored, so I\'ll go out for a bit."
"Bored?
 Wait a sec, but things are just about to get started.
 At this point, Maria\'s probably going to say that she got an umbrella and a letter from BEATRICE again, you know?
 This is the critical part—"
"You\'ll have to excuse me.
 Sorry, someone clean up this mess."
"Leave it to me."
Without saying anything else, Gretel disappeared of her own accord.
 Her form literally melted and disappeared into thin air...
There had definitely been a displeased expression on her face.
But neither Battler nor Ronove, nor of course Beato either, could understand why her mood had so suddenly worsened.
All that remained was the fragrance of the black tea she had spilled...
.........It felt very unpleasant.
No, to be even more blunt, it made my skin crawl.
"Uu...?
 ......Why are you so irritated, Ange......?"
"Why?!
 Isn\'t it obvious...?"
"Uu.
 ...Not to me......"
Even Maria onee‐chan, with that blank expression on her face, ...irritated me.
I held my hands palms‐up in the empty air, and from out of nowhere, a single book landed upon them with a thump.
.........It was Maria onee‐chan\'s diary.
Even though there was no wind, the pages flipped and flipped without me turning them,
 and opened the door to Maria onee‐chan\'s world.
"......Why do you think that I\'m not happy, Ange?"
"............By thinking about it objectively."
"Objectively from your perspective, right?"
".....................
 ......Are you trying to say that the truth is different for me and you?"
"Truth changes its form depending on the observer.
 And observers from the future always overwrite that form.
 .........Ange, what do you want with my happiness...?"
".............................."
The pages of the diary were flipped through at greater and greater speeds...
Then a brilliant light poured out from the depths of the diary, ......swallowing everything up and painting over it all with white.
".........Sorry, Maria.
 Mama has a mountain of work that needs to be urgently taken care of, so I\'m going to be confined to my workplace for a while.
 ......I probably won\'t be able to come back home until late at night the day after tomorrow."
"......Uu.
 ......Then, what about the promise to go to the movies together on Sunday......?"
"The movies...?
 Uhh—"
Judging by Rosa\'s tone, she had clearly forgotten that promise.
But Maria\'s response to that was an apology for asking...
............I\'m sorry.
Maria apologized for troubling her mother by asking that question......
".........I\'ll stay home.
 I\'ll behave myself and wait.
 ......I\'ll take a bath every day and change my underwear."
"...I know where the money is.
 ......I\'ll go to a different store every day.
 I\'ll make sure not to go out too late.
 If a policeman asks, I\'ll say I\'m running errands for Mama.
 ......I\'ll say it just like you told me to."
"...........................
 ......That\'s right.
 You be a good girl.
 If you\'re good, I\'ll buy you a present.
 Listen now.
 Go to bed by nine o\'clock.
 Make sure not to tell your teacher or any grown‐ups that Mama hasn\'t come home.
 Alright......?"
"..................\'kay.
 ......I will, so, Mama, work hard, okay?
 ......Work hard, finish your work......and come back as fast as you can..."
"I......won\'t cry during the night and annoy the neighbors anymore......
 ......So, come back soon........."
"..................
 ......Well then, I\'m busy, so I\'ll hang up now.
 ...Be a good girl and wait patiently.
 Don\'t do anything foolish.
 See you."
Click.
 ......Using a tone that indicated she was wrapping up the call, Rosa hung up the phone without waiting for Maria\'s answer.
Maria neatly set down the receiver and returned to the sofa.
There sat the stuffed animal Sakutaro, who had been watching TV with her until a second ago.
Sakutaro was clutching the remote control to the TV.
......She had turned off the TV temporarily because of the phone call.
He looked like he was asking her to turn the power on again because he wanted to quickly get back to watching TV.
"...............Sakutaro.
 ......Did you want to watch...TV?"
‘......Uryu?
 You don\'t want to watch anymore, Maria...?
 If the entertainers\' team gets all the questions right, they might turn everything around.
 Uryu~!’
".........No.
 .........That\'s enough...TV."
Again, ......Mama\'s busy with her work and isn\'t coming home.
Mama usually has a lot of overtime and doesn\'t come home until late.
......She has to socialize or something for work, so she comes home having drunk a lot of alcohol, even though she can\'t handle it,
 and with a pale face, she goes straight into the shower and then to bed.
And even on the weekends, she says she has overtime or has to stay over, and almost never comes home.
......This has been happening often recently, saying she has a big job lined up or something...
......The picture I did my best on during art class got laughed at by everyone,
 but I wanted Mama to look at it properly at least...but once again, I won\'t be able to show her.
And talk about the time when everyone pushed the cleanup onto me, but I did my best by myself and got praised by the teacher.
And talk about when I went shopping, and the man at the shop said he\'s always impressed by me and gave me a free can of coffee.
And there\'s the card I wrote and secretly hid under Mama\'s pillow,
 because I wanted to encourage her when she comes home from working so hard.
"...............And there\'s more, there\'s...so much......I wanted to talk about."
‘.........Mama is working really hard at her job.
 She\'s working with all of her strength so we can eat every day.’
"......Hate jobs.
 ......Mama should just quit that stupid job."
‘A job is an important thing for adults to do.
 ......It lets you eat food,
 buys clothes,
 pays for school lunches,
 and pays the deposit for summer camp.
 ......It\'s all because Mama works and earns money for you.’
"..............................
 ...Don\'t need food.
 Don\'t need clothes.
 Don\'t need school lunches and don\'t want to go to summer camp.
 ...It\'s not like any of the groups will let me join in."
‘Uryu......
 ......Just now, on the phone, Mama promised that she\'ll buy you a present for when she comes back from work, right?’
‘I think Mama made that promise because you\'re important to her, Maria,
 and she feels bad for making you lonely.’
".........I don\'t know."
‘Uryu!
 She definitely wouldn\'t do that if she thought you were a pain or annoying!
 ......She wants to stay by your side all the time as well.’
‘...She also finds it painful and sad that she can\'t.
 ............I remember when Mama spent the whole night by your side, crying.’
".........Yeah.
 ...Didn\'t understand why Mama was crying, ......but seeing Mama like that was so sad,
 ...and I couldn\'t do anything but stay silent by her side."
‘I remember the last thing Mama said then.
 ......She said thank you.
 .........She said that just by being by her side, you were her only ally in the whole world.
 ......Uryu, do you remember?’
"Yeah...
 .........You\'re my only ally in the whole wide world,
 ......she said."
Sakutaro set the remote on the table, crawled up onto the sofa,
 sat on my lap, ...and spoke to me while gazing into my eyes.
‘......I\'m sure Mama\'s just like you, Maria.
 .........Where the designs Mama draws are the only ones laughed at by the clients.
 ......And her company is the only one that has annoying jobs pushed onto it by other companies.’
‘Mama is the president, so she has to take care of everything all by herself.
 ......And her company is the only one that never gets to join in with the business of other companies.’
‘.........You\'re Mama\'s only ally, remember.
 ......If even you tell Mama to quit her job, ......in the whole wide world, where would Mama\'s ally be.........?’
"...............uu...
 .........Sakutaro......"
‘The only person I have in the whole world is you.
 ......And the only person Mama has in the whole world is you.
 .........What about you, Maria?’
"......I have Mama...and I have you..."
‘Then you aren\'t lonely, at all!
 Uryu!’
".........Uu."
‘Mama is busy with her work, so she can\'t be with you very often, but please, don\'t blame her for that, Maria.
 ......In exchange, I\'ll always be by your side, and I\'ll be there forever and ever. ...............So don\'t cry, okay...?’
‘.........Uryu...
 Me being with you.........can\'t stop you feeling sad......?’
"............uuu, ......uuuuuuuuuuu, Sakutaro...
 ......uuuuuuuuu!!
 UwaaAAaaAaahhh, waaAAahaaaAAahaaahhh..."
.........From the holes in Maria\'s heart, which she had been doing her best to seal up, ...drops of sadness finally dripped down.
 ......Drip, drip.
 Plop, plop.
......Sniff, sniff, drip, drip, plop, plop.
Even though weekends where Mama doesn\'t come home aren\'t that rare a thing.
......Even though this night wasn\'t especially more painful or sad than any other.
......Maria\'s tears poured down.
‘Uryuu...!
 Don\'t cry, Maria...
 I\'ll always be with you...
 Even if you\'re going to cry, I won\'t.
 I\'m a lion cub, I can\'t cry just because I\'m lonely.
 ......I want to cry too...but I\'m not going to...!’
"Why won\'t you cry, Sakutaro...?
 You still won\'t cry, even when it\'s this lonely and you can\'t hold back the tears...?"
‘Uryu.
 But if I cry, who will make you feel better...?
 So I\'m not going to cry.
 Because I want to make you smile.’
"If I smile, ......will Mama come back......?"
‘When she does come back and you greet her with a happy face, ......I\'m sure she\'ll feel the same.
 Uryu.’
"......Mama...will be happy......?"
‘Uryu.
 And then, I\'m sure, it\'ll relieve her tiredness from work as well.
 And then, I\'m sure, she\'ll get in a good mood earlier than normal, and play with you a lot.’
".............................."
‘When you come home and Mama\'s waiting for you there, and she\'s in the kitchen in a good mood, don\'t you feel really happy?
 It\'s definitely the same for her.’
"......If I stay here, being happy......she\'ll be happy too?"
‘Uryu!’
Sakutaro nodded deeply with his big head.
No more tears could fall from Maria\'s eyes.
......Because if she greeted her mama with a tear‐stained face, her mama would probably get sad too.
‘You know this already, Maria.
 You can\'t use the magic that creates smiles if you aren\'t smiling too.’
"......Yeah.
 ......I know.
 So I won\'t cry anymore."
‘Hey, Maria.
 I have an idea for how we can have a fun time.
 ......Uryu, can I tell you?’
"......What is it?"
‘Mama won\'t be coming back until late night Sunday.
 Why don\'t we have a pajama party in secret, without Mama ever knowing?’
"Pajama party...?"
‘Until you get tired late tonight, you can play with me while eating candy and drinking soda in bed.’
"A pajama party.
 ......Yeah, that sounds fun.
 ...I don\'t have to go to bed at nine?
 Mama won\'t get mad at me for not going to bed?"
‘This is a secret between you and me, only for when Mama isn\'t around.
 So, until you get sleepy, let\'s spend the whole night having fun together.’
‘Let\'s eat jellybeans and try to guess what color we\'ll get next.
 Let\'s split open peanuts and try to guess which half is the grandpa.’
‘Let\'s search for treasure in the closet.
 And more, so much more!
 I wonder what it\'ll taste like if we mix orange juice and melon soda.’
"Uu.
 Wanted to try that once, but asked Mama if it was alright and she got mad."
‘Uryuu!
 Let\'s try it out in secret from Mama♪
 Tonight, let\'s play a lot, laugh a lot, and blow away our tears with happiness.
 Don\'t worry, with me here, it\'ll definitely be fun!
 I\'ll make you happy for sure, Maria.’
"Yeah... Yeah.
 I know it\'ll be fun with you here.
 It\'ll definitely make me happy.
 Thanks, Sakutaro.
 Won\'t cry anymore.
 Let\'s have a super fun time together, make ourselves super happy, and say welcome home with a smile on our faces when Mama gets back."
‘Uryuu!
 Let\'s play and play tonight and get in a really great mood♪
 Let\'s play a lot in a secret party that we can only have when Mama isn\'t here.’
‘If we\'re lively enough, I\'m sure plenty of friends will come to play from Wonderland and Looking‐Glass Land.
 We\'ll have so many friends at that point that there simply won\'t be time left to feel bored.
 Uryuu!’
"Uryuu!!"
......And then I started my pajama party with Sakutaro, and had fun until late into the night.
I played by sticking my hand into the bag of jellybeans without looking, and trying to guess which color I would pull out.
......Sakutaro had good intuition and got it right a lot.
Partway through, I also achieved the brilliant feat of guessing right four times in a row.
The game where I split peanuts open and tried to guess which half would be the grandpa...
was easier than guessing the color of the jellybeans, so I got it right a lot.
Sucking my salt‐covered fingers was bad manners, but that was the yummiest part.
I like both orange juice and melon soda on their own.
I hoped that by mixing those two favorite drinks, there might be a flash of light like alchemy,
 and a new drink that no one had ever tasted before would be created.
I got excited about how, if it turned out really delicious, I\'d call it Sakutaro Soda and sell it.
But, unexpectedly, it had a weird and disappointing taste.
And the color was somewhat dull and boring.
...Maybe I shouldn\'t have been surprised that orange and green mixed together would make this.
 ......Too bad. I imagined that it would become a sparkling pineapple color.
But, it was an awesome, awesome, fun night.
If I\'m having this much fun, maybe Mama will start wanting to come home too, and unexpectedly appear at the front door.
......So I got the feeling that Mama might suddenly come home,
 and went to the front door many times to check, but there was no way Mama would be able to come home when she was this busy with work.
But rather than a feeling of loneliness,
 I felt just a little disappointed that I couldn\'t invite Mama to join in on such a fun late‐night party.
Next time, I\'ll do this when Mama is around, and let her join in.
Even some things that I don\'t think are yummy, Mama says are delicious,
 so she might say that Sakutaro Soda is really yummy.
When Mama comes back tired, I\'ll serve her some.
And more than anything.
......I wanted to at least write about this fun night in a letter, and tell Mama about it.
Hoping that these strong feelings of happiness would reach Mama too.
Hoping that when Mama comes home exhausted from her job, which is always so tough for her, I could share this happiness with her.
Hoping that when Mama comes home late Sunday night, almost certainly tired,
 I could make her even just a little brighter by sharing this happiness......
I softly placed that letter on Mama\'s desk.
To Mama.
Good job with your work again today☆ Some of my happiness for you to share.
――From Maria
Then, I decided to give a present to Sakutaro for proposing this wonderful night.
A small red scarf that I had found when searching for treasure in my closet.
When Maria was still very young, her mama had knitted this tiny, tiny, red scarf for her.
"Maria" was embroidered on it with knitting wool.
......She softly wrapped that scarf around Sakutaro.
It really suited him, accenting his yellow with red very well.
‘.........Uryu.
 ...Does it suit me......?’
Sakutaro looked embarrassed as he wore his first present ever.
......Yeah.
 It really suits him.
"Uu.
 Sakutaro, thank you so much for everything.
 It was so fun tonight.
 I can\'t even remember why I was crying.
 ......Let\'s always stick together, okay?
 And let\'s always play and laugh together."
‘Uryuu!
 Love you, Maria!’
"Me too.
 Love you, Sakutaro."
After playing so wildly, my room was a mess.
Maybe I played a little too much.
......But I\'m tired for today, so let\'s sleep together now.
 And tomorrow, we\'ll clean up together and welcome Mama with a clean room.
 ......Okay? Sakutaro?
Uryuu♪
"......See?
 See how happy I...no, see how happy me and Sakutaro are?"
"..................
 Is this your happiness, Maria onee‐chan...?"
"Yep.
 I am happy."
"......Even though you were looking forward to that movie so much, and Aunt Rosa promised that she\'d definitely take you, she completely forgot."
"She just happened to forget because she was so busy with work.
 ......Even if she had remembered, she couldn\'t have done anything about it with her work."
"Whether she remembered or not, Mama would spend the night at work in either case.
 She couldn\'t go to the movies.
 .........Whether she remembered the promise or not is insignificant."
......There\'s no way that\'s insignificant.
After all, ......when Aunt Rosa replied "The movies?" on the phone,
 it was obvious that she had completely forgotten her promise.
And when she heard that, Maria onee‐chan\'s mood definitely darkened.
"Well, ......like you say,
 even if Aunt Rosa had remembered her promise, you wouldn\'t have been able to go to the movies in the end."
"......But even so.
 ......To think that your mother just forgot her promise to spend one of her few days off with you, ...it\'s sad.
 I\'d be angry."
"..............................
 ...Yeah.
 It was sad.
 Because even if she had remembered, we wouldn\'t have been able to go to the movies."
"......But after that, I had a very, very fun night with Sakutaro.
 You must\'ve thought that pajama party looked really fun too, Ange."
"...........................
 There\'s no way that would be fun."
"...I mean, all of that messing around you did that night,
 ......was just you intentionally making a frenzy out of nothing so you could forget that you were lonely and that your mother wasn\'t coming home."
"That\'s not true.
 Really did have a fun party with Sakutaro."
"No, you didn\'t!
 You were just so sad, and you hated your mother so much for forgetting her promise, that you made a mess of your room...!!"
"...............Where was something like that ever written in my diary?"
"It isn\'t written anywhere!
 But......by reading in the gaps between every line, I can tell how you felt!
 You didn\'t have a good time at all that evening!"
"And you stayed up late when you were told not to, broke the strict rule about not eating sweets outside of snack time,
 ......and when even that didn\'t bury your sadness, you went wild in your room, .........and made a mess of it, isn\'t that all...?!!"
"And after you made a mess of your room and were all tired out,
 .........all you did was claw at the bed sheets and cry yourself to sleep...!"
".........It is written in the diary that Mama probably forgot her promise about the movie,
 and that I stayed up late having a pajama party with Sakutaro, ......and made a mess of my room searching for treasure."
"Yes.
 And that.........can only mean one thing, can\'t it?!
 You were starving for Auntie Rosa\'s love...!
 And Aunt Rosa always put her work and her public image first, always keeping you on the back‐burner...!"
"That\'s why it makes my skin crawl!
 Because I know just how superficial Aunt Rosa\'s words of love for you are!!
 You should realize this yourself!"
"So......how can you say that you\'re happy?!
 I don\'t understand that......that part of you, Maria onee‐chan!!
 Even at this age, I can\'t understand it at all...!!"
"How aren\'t you sad?
 How is it that you can experience a reality filled with misfortune and call yourself happy?!
 I can\'t do it, I can\'t understand it...!!"
"...............You are a sad kid, Ange."
"I don\'t get it!!
 Why are you pitying me?!"
".........Even though a "fact" about a really fun pajama party is written in my diary,
 .........when it\'s observed by a different person, it looks like that same "fact" takes a different form, huh."
I remembered talking about this with BERNKASTEL.
Truth is indeterminate and changes its form every time it\'s observed.
By the way it is perceived, ...in other words, depending on the person who perceives it, a single truth becomes different truths.
And truths of the past are painted over by truths of the future......
"In this diary, I wrote that what happened that night was very, very fun."
"......You described the events of that night as something very happy."
"And yet, when you read the diary, you read the events of that night as very, very sad."
"......Even though you described it as happiness, I read it as something different."
"Stop it."
"................................."
"This...tells of a happy night.
 .........This is...the "truth" of that night.
 Please, don\'t take this happy truth,
 ............and paint over it with a new and different truth."
"............Does this make you......happy, Maria onee‐chan?"
"Yep.
 Happy.
 .........That\'s why I feel so sorry for you, because you can\'t feel happiness in the same situation."
.........Both she back then, and I now, have the same friendless and lonely situation.
And Ange......accepted the lonely truth as the lonely truth.
 But she......painted over the lonely truth with a happy truth.
Ushiromiya Maria took the sad truth...
...and changed it into happiness.
That...
...is the only, and yet all too large, ...difference between me and Maria onee‐chan.
And at the same time as being unable to accept it,
 ......another part of me is jealous of that power.
"Yeah.
 ......That\'s right.
 It is "power".
 ......With that power, I was able to become happy.
 And without it, you can\'t."
"That.........power,
 ............what is it............?"
"I didn\'t know what to call that power either.
 ......At this point in time, at least.
 ...Eventually, I would be taught its true form."
"......I\'ll talk about it later.
 On a later page.
 .........So then, so then, late Sunday night.
 With a present, just like she\'d promised, Mama came back......"
".........I\'m back."
"Mamaaaa, welcome hoooooooome!!"
‘Uryuu!!
 Mama came back, Mama came back!’
Waiting to greet Rosa, as she returned home all tired out,
 was Maria, holding Sakutaro, in an unbelievably good mood.
Rosa\'s worn out expression was surely due at least in part to actual fatigue,
 ......but also partially because she was sick and tired of having Maria cling to her and loudly whine and sob after being left alone in the house for a few days.
However, when she was welcomed by an unbelievably happy Maria,
 ......and discovered unbelievably that her fears had been unfounded, Rosa couldn\'t hide her surprise.
"Wh‐......what\'s going on, Maria...?
 You\'re in a great mood, aren\'t you...?!
 Is someone here...?!"
It was strange enough to make Rosa think that a friend might have come over, and that she had come back home in the middle of them having a good time playing together.
But there were no other shoes by the entrance.
......Even though Maria was in such high spirits, she was home alone.
At first, Rosa was suspicious that this unexpectedly good mood might have some kind of unwelcome underlying cause,
 but that really was a needless fear, ......and it really did seem to be that Maria had actually stayed at home in a good mood.
.........Even if Rosa\'s heart had been as cold and hard as a rock, ...after being welcomed with a smile like this...
...Rosa started to honestly accept that smile, and a smile rose to her own face automatically.
......In that smile, you could see none of the weariness caused by being unable to return home for several days.
Maria kept talking about what a fun time she\'d had playing with the stuffed animal Sakutaro.
Rosa really hadn\'t imagined that the stuffed animal she\'d gifted her would be liked so much, and she couldn\'t hide her pleasant surprise.
"I see.
 So you and Sakutarou were having fun watching the house together.
 Well done, Maria.
 I have presents for you and Sakutarou for being so good."
‘Uryuu!
 Presents!
 Presents!’
"Uu!
 I wonder what they are, I wonder what they are!"
Maria started jumping around with Sakutaro.
There were two presents.
 One was a Western cake assortment.
It contained different kinds of Scotch cakes.
 It looked to be of very high quality.
But Maria was more interested in the other one.
The other one was an even bigger box, and it was pretty heavy.
"Open it and have a look.
 They might become new friends for you and Sakutarou, who knows?"
"Wowwwwwwwwww...!
 What\'s this!
 What\'s this?!"
Inside, laid there like chess pieces, were about twenty small ceramic animal figures.
Squirrels, rabbits, small birds, dogs and cats.
And they were all holding musical instruments.
In addition to them, there was also a panorama‐style background.
A forest scene was drawn on it.
Little woodland animals were all gathered around a forest clearing, and they looked like they were having a good time.
Rosa set it up on the table.
......And when she then lined up the ceramic figures like chess pieces in front of it,
 .........it became a band of forest animals.
"Isn\'t it wonderful?
 I saw it in the store window, and I was taken with it at a glance.
 This is a present for you for being such a good girl home alone, Maria."
"Uuuu!!!
 Thank you, Mamaaa!!!"
"Isn\'t this amazing, Sakutaro?!
 Look how many more friends we have...!
 It was just like you said, Sakutaro!
 It was true, we had a fun and lively time, and we did get more friends...!"
‘See, didn\'t I tell you?
 Look, we have more friends, look, we have more friends!
 Uryu~♪’
Relieved that her gift had been appreciated,
 Rosa suddenly remembered that she was filled with several days of weariness...
"Mama, you really worked hard...!
 You should go take a shower.
 If you take a hot one, I\'m sure your tiredness will go away.
 Want to take a bath?
 I\'ll choose what to put in the bath today!"
"Thank you.
 But it\'s already late, so you get ready for bed.
 Mama\'s tired, so I\'ll just take a shower and go to bed right away.
 I have to get up early tomorrow."
"Yep, okay!
 Here, Mama, I\'ll take your coat off for youuu."
"No, really, I can do it myself...
 ...Ahh, thank you."
"Your coat is full of smells from outside.
 ......Uu?
 Oh, sorry, dropped something.
 I\'ll pick it up, okay?"
When she had taken Rosa\'s coat, a receipt or ticket stub or something had fallen out.
...It had been in her mama\'s pocket, so it was probably important.
Maria hurriedly picked it up...
It looked like a ticket for a Green Car or the Shinkansen or something.
............Atami?
 Maybe it\'s that place famous for its hot springs...?
Just then.
 ...A razor‐sharp sound shattered the warm atmosphere.
Instead of the Rosa who had been there just a second ago, enjoying a gift with her daughter and full of weariness after returning home for the first time in several days,
 .........there stood a completely different person, who looked exactly the same, but had the most terrible of expressions on her face.
...In her hand was the ticket stub that Maria had picked up.
...She had stolen it from Maria\'s hand in an instant.
After a few seconds\' delay,
 ...by the pain of her hand that had been hit,
 and her mother\'s expression,
 Maria realized that she must have done something wrong.
But she didn\'t know what she had done that had gotten her in trouble.
......It was probably because of that ticket‐stub‐like thing.
Was she not supposed......to touch it.........?
Even though she had tried so hard to welcome her mama with fun and happiness,
 ...she had touched something important to her without asking, and had ruined that pleasant atmosphere...
......So Maria apologized immediately.
"S‐......sorry........."
"............nh.
 .................."
Even though she must have heard those words of apology, Rosa\'s expression actually darkened.
...Maybe those words had been undesired?
Maria didn\'t know what to do, and cautiously watched to see how her mother would act...
Then, even though it should have been such an important ticket stub,
 Rosa crushed it up and hurried off to her room...
Maria......didn\'t really understand what she had done wrong......
".........Uu......
 ......I must have...
......done something I shouldn\'t have......
 ...That paper must have been something important for Mama\'s work.
 And I touched it without asking..."
‘Uryu......
 ...You didn\'t do anything wrong, Maria.........
 ...So look how happy we are tonight as well.’
"Yeah.
 ...Happy."
‘And when Mama takes a bath and clears her head, she\'ll go back to being the normal, nice Mama.
 So you mustn\'t worry about it.
 Uryu.’
"You\'re right......
 Mama\'s tired too, after all.
 ......Uu, mustn\'t worry about it.
 We\'re so very happy tonight."
‘Uryu.’
"..................Please stop.
 ...I can\'t bear to watch this."
"......Ange, I think you\'re looking for happiness in the wrong way."
"You\'re the one who\'s wrong!!
 How can you call this happiness...?!!
 It\'s too...painful for me even to watch it anymore!!"
"What is...?
 That Mama suddenly got mad?
 .........That happens sometimes when people get tired.
 ......Condemning a person because of a momentary misplaced emotion isn\'t very adult of you, Ange."
"......I can\'t believe I\'m hearing this from a nine‐year‐old...
 But that\'s not the problem, is it?!
 That ticket stub you picked up was clearly strange!"
"How?
 There was nothing strange about it, and it has nothing to do with the happiness of that night..."
"Aunt Rosa called you saying she\'d be staying over at work because of her job, right?!
 Why Atami?!
 Isn\'t that what you call a vacation?!"
"It means she left you behind and went on a vacation, doesn\'t it?!
 And you normally don\'t go on a vacation by yourse—"
"Even if that was a ticket for Atami,
 that alone doesn\'t make it proof that Mama lied and went on a vacation, does it...?"
"She lied on the phone, changed her expression like that and grabbed it from you!
 What more proof could you want...?!!"
".........It might be from a business trip long ago, right?
 Or maybe she just happened to pick up some trash or something and put it in her pocket.
 It might even be a receipt from someone who works for her who went on a business trip."
"...In that case, it was important for her work.
 It wasn\'t a toy, so I can understand why Mama took it away.
 ......This evidence you\'re talking about is nothing more than circumstantial evidence.
 Imagination and delusions.
 ......I don\'t know why you\'re interpreting it so that my relationship with Mama is bad."
"I\'m the one who doesn\'t understand how you can interpret it in a way that\'s so convenient for Aunt Rosa!!"
".........You really are a poor child, Ange.
 .........There are fragments that could make you happy,
 so many of them, scattered all about your feet, and you can\'t find them."
"......Instead, all you find are the unhappy fragments, and you keep getting hurt over and over.
 ......That\'s why you get scared of being hurt,
 ......and you can\'t start even looking for happiness until after you\'ve finished making sure that there\'s nothing around you that could hurt you."
"..................When I talk with you, Onee‐chan, it gets hard to tell which one of us isn\'t making sense."
"You know what?
 There are lots and lots of both happy and unhappy fragments, and the world is full to the brim with both kinds.
 So people who can\'t find happiness right beside them won\'t be able to find it no matter where they go looking.
 ......Like Tyltyl and Mytyl searching for the blue bird."
"............Yes.
 The story did have that moral."
"You\'re the complete opposite, Ange.
 You\'re searching for a world without a single unhappy fragment.
 But even that\'s the same as the blue bird.
 So you\'ll be unable to find your own happiness for all eternity."
"............Battler is Hansel, is he?
 Isn\'t he the blue bird......?"
"......Give it a rest already.
 .........In any event, I got the point that a night of happiness was wasted because of a single scrap of paper that fell from a coat."
"It\'s scary, isn\'t it?
 That a single scrap of paper could do that.
 ......In that case, maybe the power to get happiness back can also lie in a single scrap of paper, don\'t you think?"
Just when she had finally been able to bond with Maria after so long......
Rosa\'s face twisted with a mixture of anger, sadness, and a fierce self‐hatred as she flew into her room and closed the door.
.........Maria\'s "sorry" had stuck into her chest more sharply than any knife.
Then,
 ......she noticed a cute envelope placed on her study table.
It was probably something that had come with a girls\' magazine.
.........To Mama.
 Some of my happiness for you to share, it said.
She took it, .........hesitated, opened it, ...and read what was inside.
....................................
Then, after dotting the surface of the paper...
with two large tears...
......she flew out of the room,
 hugged Maria from behind as she headed for the bathroom,
 .........buried her face into her daughter\'s back,
 ......and cried.
And, realizing that she was the one who should truly be saying sorry,
 ...
...
...
...
she apologized to her.
And when Maria asked why,
 she gave no answer......
".........See.
 Already made up.
 .........A little thing like that was absolutely nothing to worry about, because of the friendliness between Mama and me."
"........................
 .........Your happiness is...too painful for me."
"......I do understand your feelings more or less, Ange.
 ......Until I realized my "power",
 ...even I was just like you, a sorry child who could only find fragments filled with misfortune."
"............What is this "power"?
 This power that I don\'t have, but you do.
 ...And are you saying that me not having it is the reason I have misery and you have joy?
 .........Just what is this thing that you can\'t describe except with an abstract word like "power"......?"
"Yeah.
 That is what you want to know, isn\'t it, Ange?
 ......That\'s why you\'ve been reading my story all this time."
"............Of course I\'ll teach you.
 The secret to that power.
 ......And I did teach you about it long ago, when you were little, you know...?
 Did you forget...?"
"Don\'t worry, you\'ll be able to remember.
 ......Now I...
......no, she.
 She will teach you."
"............She......?
 Who\'s that?"
"I shall teach you in MARIA\'s place."
".........B‐
............BEATRICE..............."
"The "power" that MARIA has, but you do not."
"Yep.
 The "power" I have, but you do not."
――That...is magic.
Maria and Beato said it together.
 And then they started giggling because they\'d said it at the same time.
......It was an innocent behavior, which seemed somehow unlike Beato.
Black tea was arranged on a table in a peaceful garden,
 and Beato, Maria, and Sakutarou, who was sitting on Maria\'s lap, were having fun chatting...
"............Hoh.
 I see, so he is called Sakutarou.
 And your best friend, you say!"
‘Uryu...
 It\'s nice to meet you, my name is Sakutarou...’
"Uu, Sakutaro is shy so he\'s nervous right now.
 It\'s okay, BEATRICE is my wonderful friend too...!"
‘Uryu.
 Are your friends my friends...?’
"Yeah!"
‘Uryu. ......Then I\'m BEATRICE\'s friend too?’
"Yeah!"
‘Uryuu!’
"......Maria, do things like this happen frequently for you in your everyday life?"
"Uu?
 Things?"
"Is breathing a soul of magic into inorganic matter and giving it life in this way...
a commonplace practice for you?"
"......Uu.
 Sakutaro isn\'t inorganic matter, he\'s a lion cub."
‘Uryuu!’
"Hmm......
 ......A stuffed animal makes for an excellent vessel.
 Therefore, when it is spoken to by an innocent child without toxin, it is not uncommon for a spirit to take up residence within, in an attempt to respond to them."
According to BEATRICE, when a child "plays with dolls",
 the dolls sometimes gain an actual will and converse with them, in rare cases even moving on their own.
However, the power that they can imbue into such a vessel is very weak due to their innocence.
If even a tiny bit of the toxin from a Human\'s common sense gets involved, and tells them that there\'s no way a doll can talk or move,
 it instantly reverts to being an ordinary non‐speaking doll......
"However, ......this...Sakutarou stuffed animal of yours is different."
"Uu!
 Sakutaro is a stuffed animal, but he\'s not just a stuffed animal!"
‘Uryuu!
 Lion cuuuub!
 Ga‐...ga‐......uryuu!’
"Sakutaro is a lion cub, but he\'s still a kid, so he can\'t say gaooo sometimes.
 Uryu‐uryu‐uryu♪"
‘Uryu‐uryu‐uryuu!’
BEATRICE let out a sigh of admiration as she gazed at Maria, playing around with Sakutaro at the table loaded with tea.
".........How incredible.
 This "Sakutarou", with a core of a cloth‐and‐cotton vessel, has completely manifested into the human world.
 He has his own character, talks with his summoner freely,
 and even moves by his own will."
"......And what is most surprising is that you did not summon him by name as a being from another world,
 but created him out of the sea of zero."
After that, Maria boasted to Beato that Sakutarou wasn\'t her only friend, and that when she went home, there would be plenty more of them.
She claimed that there were other similar stuffed animals and dolls who, like Sakutarou, could talk and move of their own will.
It was something natural to Maria.
 It was natural for stuffed animals to talk, move, and become her friends of their own free will.
......When she heard Maria speak of this in that way, BEATRICE, as a witch, felt a respect bordering on awe.
"............Maria.
 Without a doubt, that power of yours is magic."
"It\'s magic......?
 But I\'m still a witch apprentice, I\'m not able to use magic yet..."
"Not so, it is magic indeed.
 .........You may be an apprentice since you are unable to use it in full awareness of that fact,
 ......but even so, what power this magic has!
 The manifestation of your friend Sakutarou is excellent proof of that."
"Many...festation...?"
"Mm.
 In your case, it may even be fitting to call it creation.
 ......A piece of inorganic matter that would have no soul at all in another\'s hands has had a soul imbued into it through your magic."
"Furthermore, you are using strong power to keep it tethered to the human world.
 ......In this era so filled with the toxin that denies magic, maintaining the magical power necessary to manifest a being to the degree that it can exist as an independent life‐form is not easy even for me."
It isn\'t hard to create soulless beings in any number.
However, creating a being with a soul is very difficult.
...Beato declared this definitively.
".........Don\'t really understand what you\'re saying, Beato.
 You\'re saying Sakutaro is amazing...?"
"I am saying that you and Sakutarou both are marvelous.
 ......You may feel proud.
 ...Yes, that which Kinzo desired above all else seems to dwell most strongly within you."
"Don\'t have a clue why you\'re praising me so much.
 Ri~ght, Sakutaro?"
‘Uryu~!’
"......What is truly admirable is not only that you have caused a soul to reside in a stuffed animal.
 It is the fact that by that act, you have changed your own worldview.
 ......Your power to create something from nothing is beyond exceptional."
"......It is simple to make a hundred from one.
 However, creating one from zero is not easy.
 ...When you become a full witch, you may not only be a match for me, but might even grow into a Great Witch that I must acknowledge as superior."
"The Witch of Origins, perhaps.
 .........I, too, am greatly looking forward to your future."
"Uu!
 Beato said I have talent as a wi~tch!"
‘Isn\'t that great, Maria?!
 Uryu, Beato...thank you for praising Maria.’
"*cackle*cackle*!
 There is no need to thank me, Sakutarou.
 That red scarf truly suits you.
 And I am envious of the talent of your master that enabled her to create a friend like you."
‘Uryu~!
 Thanks for complimenting my scarf.
 I got it as a present from Maria.
 I really like it.’
"And its size is truly as if it was created just for you.
 ......Yes, in light of this, I see that I must also give my new friend some kind of present."
"Uu?
 Beato, you\'re giving Sakutaro a present......?"
"A gift from a witch must be something with magical power, of course.
 In that case, so that your friend can remain your friend for all time, and so that you can have even more fun playing with him..."
"I shall give Sakutarou my magic power.
 It should allow him to achieve an even stronger manifestation."
"Uu?
 I\'ll be able to have much more fun playing with Sakutaro...?
 How?"
‘Uryu......?
 What could it be, Maria...
 Is it something scary......?’
"Don\'t worry.
 Beato won\'t do anything scary.
 Right, BEATRICEEE?!"
"Mm.
 I am certain that he will like it.
 .........Let us see then...yes, in order to achieve a stronger manifestation, a stronger image will be necessary.
 .........Well, now, what to do.
 Hmmmmmmmmmm..."
Beato folded her arms and thought about what she could do to please them the most.
And at that moment, there appeared...
......the form of yet another witch.
It was Beato\'s master, VIRGILIA.
VIRGILIA truly was a Great Witch.
...Since Maria already thought of Beato as a Great Witch, this person Beato called a Great Witch must have been a Great Great Witch.
According to Beato, not even she could hold a candle to this witch when it came to magical power.
"My, my.
 I thought I heard some cheery voices.
 What a fun tea party this seems to be..."
"Oh, Master.
 Perfect timing.
 I want you to take a look at this lion cub.
 I hear he\'s Maria\'s new friend."
"Hoh‐hoh‐ho.
 What an adorable little lion.
 ......I wonder if he can greet me?
 Hello, nice to meet you...?"
‘U‐uryuu!
 I, I\'m Sakutarou.’
Sakutaro got back down onto Maria\'s lap, and greeted VIRGILIA with half of his face poking out over the edge of the table.
...He seemed to be very nervous since this was a witch that even Beato called Master.
"Hoh‐hoh‐ho.
 What a lovely name.
 ......As a reward for giving such a good greeting, here\'s a sweet for you."
After waving her hands about, VIRGILIA held the palm of her hand upwards, and made a movement as though lightly grasping some of the air.
Then, she held that closed fist out in front of Sakutaro.
............And when she opened it, there lay one of those individually wrapped cough drops.
‘Uryuu?!
 It\'s candy, Maria, oh wow, oh wow...!!’
"Uu!
 Isn\'t that nice, Sakutaro?!
 Make sure to thank her."
‘Uryu.
 Thank you very much for the candy.
 ...*bow*.’
Even though VIRGILIA was a Great Great Witch, she still treated a stuffed animal like Sakutarou to an elegant greeting.
"Still, Master, cough drops? Are you someone\'s granny or something...?!
 Can\'t you at least pull out some strawberry‐milk candy~?"
"How mean.
 Perhaps I won\'t give you candy anymore?"
"Kuhhyahhyahhya, sorry, sorry.
 .........Well then, Maria.
 Take out your grimoire.
 And, of course, your writing tools."
"Uu?
 Okay, taking it out.
 Are we writing something?"
"......Oh? What\'s happening now?"
"I will use a magic I learned from you, Master.
 .........Magic to make a resident of another world manifest into a vessel."
"I think that by applying that, I may be able to further strengthen the power manifesting this friend of Maria\'s.
 ......I want to give that as a gift to Maria and her friend."
"I see.
 ...It shouldn\'t be that difficult for a being that has already manifested.
 That seems like it will turn out to be a wonderful gift.
 Well then, I shall offer what modest help I can."
"If you shall be signing for this magic personally as a witness, Master, that is greatly encouraging...!
 Rejoice, Maria.
 This shall be a wonderful gift...!"
‘Uryu...?
 What\'s happening...?
 It isn\'t scary, is it?
 Is it...?’
"Don\'t know.
 But don\'t think it\'s scary.
 ......Wonder what it is. Exciting, huh?"
Beato borrowed the grimoire from Maria\'s handbag and majestically riffled through the pages.
......Then, finding an empty page among those with magic circles drawn on them, she flattened the book out.
And after staring at Sakutarou with a smirk, she suddenly started darting her pen across the page.
......It was something like a written proclamation made by witches to a higher‐order world.
Magic, which would take effect by BEATRICE writing it and VIRGILIA giving her signature as a witness.
Maria didn\'t understand what Beato was doing at first, but partway through, she figured out the wonderful magic power of this document, and her eyes began to sparkle...
‘Uryu?!
 Uryu?!
 What is it, Maria, what\'s she drawing?!
 Uryu‐uryu?!’
Sakutarou was on her lap, so he didn\'t know what was being written up on the table.
......But even if he had seen, Sakutarou probably wouldn\'t have understood.
"It\'s amazing, Sakutaro!!
 Wait a bit, almost done, almost done!
 Beato that\'s awesome, Beato that\'s awesome!!"
".........When it comes to writing documents of power, this child\'s talent is splendid.
 I expect you could even work as a secretary in the netherworld."
"How is this...?!
 It should be passable...!"
After she had completed the thing she had been so intensely concentrating on, Beato looked over the document again from a distance.
......It seemed she was fairly satisfied with her work.
And Maria, upon also peeking in at it, let out a cry of wonder.
"......It\'s amazing, Beato!!
 So cuuute!!
 Uu‐uu‐uu!!"
"By the name of the Golden Witch BEATRICE, I hereby acknowledge Sakutarou, MARIA\'s child.
 .........Master, if you would sign as a witness!"
"Yes, yes.
 ......By my name, I stand witness to and acknowledge this oath.
 .........It is done."
VIRGILIA signed, completing the proclamation.
It was a powerful document that proclaimed to the beings of a higher world that Sakutarou had most certainly manifested in the human world.
Sakutarou, created by Maria, had received the recommendation of the two witches BEATRICE and VIRGILIA,
 and in this very moment, the higher world had accepted his existence.
......That was the great magic of manifestation.
According to Beato, it was apparently an incredible stroke of luck that VIRGILIA had been here.
Because the power residing in the proclamation would change drastically depending on the number and the ranks of the witches signing it.
VIRGILIA in particular had many friends in the higher world,
 so her signature gave the proclamation a power with which Beato\'s couldn\'t even compare.
"By this proclamation, I accept thee, Sakutarou, as an individual with thine own sense of self.
 And I welcome thee as a friend in accordance with the treaty of Mariage Sorcière.
 Henceforth, Sakutarou, thou art our common friend."
"And as a gift, I shall bestow upon you a form appropriate to that status.
 Accept it."
With the grimoire still opened to the page with the proclamation, she turned it around and handed it to Maria.
Maria showed it to Sakutarou on her lap.
When Sakutarou beheld that proclamation,
 ............in his body made of cloth and cotton,
 he felt something hot and bright begin to dwell.
Even as he looked around, nervous at this sensation that he had never felt before, that power strengthened,
 ......and eventually, a bright light completely swallowed him up...
‘Uryu......?
 Uryu‐uryu‐uryu‐uryu......!’
And when that light disappeared...
............There, Maria\'s friend Sakutarou held a new form, and existed.
"Uu‐uu‐uu!
 You\'re cute, Sakutaro!
 Reeeeally cute!"
‘Uryu...?
 Uryuu...
 Does it really suit me?
 It isn\'t embarrassing......?’
"Hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho.
 It is a very lovely form, Sakutarou‐chan."
"I felt that the scarf was his charm point, you see.
 And the ears!
 Animal ears are nice indeed, truly cute!
 Allow me to nibble at them later.
 *cackle*!"
"Thank you, BEATRICEEE!!
 Thank you so much for the wonderful present!!"
"There is no need for thanks.
 This is merely an expression of my respect for your wonderful magic and your friend."
".........And now that you have reached this level, it would not be odd for you to graduate from an apprentice at any time.
 Starting today, I shall initiate you in even newer and more fun forms of magic."
"......From this point forward, you may call yourself MARIA, the Apprentice Witch of Origins."
"What\'s the Witch of Origins...?"
"Mm.
 It is the title of a witch who seeks to become a Creator.
 Right now, you are just an Enchanter, possessing only enough strength to breathe magical power into the small objects around you."
"......But after one thousand years of training, it is not unthinkable that you could create not just your own system of magic, but even a galaxy."
"......The talent of the Witch of Origins is very rare.
 Even though everyone has it when they are young, no one can continue to hold onto it.
 ......This title is also proof that you have not lost your untainted heart."
"Uu!!
 Witch of Origins, wow!
 I\'ll become one!
 I\'m the Apprentice Witch of Origiiins!"
‘Maria, that\'s so cool...!
 The Witch of Origins, wow, awesome, uryuu!’
"Eventually, you will probably be able to call yourself by the title of a full witch—Lady MARIA, the Witch of Origins.
 ......It may be a good time now to give not only Sakutarou, but you as well, an appearance fitting for your rank."
".........There.
 I shall give a proper outfit for one who, while an apprentice, is worthy of calling herself a witch."
When Beato waved the pipe that was her wand,
 many gold butterflies appeared out of nowhere, grouped around Maria, and granted her a wonderful dress.
Endowed with both cuteness and majesty, it was indeed a fitting article of clothing for the girl who would eventually take the name of the Witch of Origins...
"Oh wow...!!
 Awesome awesome awesome awesome!!
 So cute, so cute!
 I want to show these clothes to Mama too...!!
 Can\'t I?"
"The full dress of a witch must not be shown indiscriminately.
 Such a thing is worth more if you reserve it for those most grandiose occasions.
 *cackle*!"
And then, the Great Witch, the witch, the witch\'s apprentice, and their new friend Sakutarou, had a lively time enjoying their tea together......
".........See?
 Look how happy I am.
 And look how fun this is."
"..........................."
"Please, don\'t be afraid of being happy.
 Becoming happy isn\'t the same thing as accepting your current misfortune.
 It means creating a new happiness within your current misfortune.
 That is the Magic of Origins."
"......I...didn\'t want to acknowledge my current world.
 ......I couldn\'t abide accepting such an isolated and painful world.
 ...That\'s why, even though I was entranced by your world, Maria onee‐chan,
 ......I couldn\'t cross the final line."
"............I\'ll teach you.
 About my Magic of Origins.
 No, I taught you before, right?
 And you used to be able to use it.
 Did you forget......?"
"..........................."
"You were also a witch apprentice, Ange, with your name entered into Mariage Sorcière, weren\'t you?"
"............Yes.
 So I was.
 .........Mariage Sorcière,
 ...that takes me back.
 ......I also had my name entered in there at one point, didn\'t I..."
