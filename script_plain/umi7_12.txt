The months and years slid by.
In my new, more colorful life, I smiled at the spring sunshine peeking through the trees, gazed up at the column of summer clouds,
 enjoyed the piles of fallen leaves in autumn, and played in the winter snow the few times it did fall.
As these days passed one after another, there was a considerable change to my environment.
That was a complete rotation in the servants from the Gospel House.
There weren\'t specific grades like in school, so there was no rule saying how long a servant could work before quitting.
Each servant made their own decision about when they would "graduate" from Rokkenjima.
Some of those who couldn\'t stand the environment would quit in as little as three days.
After all, life on Rokkenjima was strict.
It was also strict in the Gospel House, of course, but there were a lot of Rokkenjima‐only rules,
 and Natsuhi, the one who supervised the servants, was also very authoritarian.
 It was probably easy to feel constrained.
That constrained feeling and the money sat on opposite sides of the scale that they used to decide the time of their graduation.
And sometimes, someone from the Ushiromiya family would use their influence to secure someone a new job, encouraging them to spread their wings and start a new life.
The cycle usually lasted two or three years.
No one decided this, but it was one of the goals most servants shot for, an unspoken rule.
However, I was an exception to that rule.
I continued to live as a servant while going to school in Niijima......
That year, all of the Gospel House servants quit at once.
It wasn\'t at all rare for friends to quit at the same time as each other.
All of my fellow servants from the Gospel House graduated from the island at once, leaving only me behind...
Of course, I hadn\'t been on particularly good terms with them.
On the contrary, it was annoying to be treated like a kid and called Yasu all the time.
Even when new servants had joined,
 the older ones got them believing that "Yasu loses things all the time",
 so things had still been unpleasant even then.
Those unpleasant older servants, as well as the ones who started at the same time or after I did, all quit at once.
The Ushiromiya family had no quarrel with those who left.
 Adult servants were easier to handle in the first place.
The Gospel House servants were only accepted so that they could be trained.
So, all of the servants except for me left, and no one tried to stop them......
"Later, Yasu.
 Don\'t go losing stuff again."
"......I don\'t lose things anymore."
"Hmph, later.
 Make sure you listen to what Madam says.
 Don\'t you go troubling the next group of servants."
"......You know, it\'s still a mystery.
 Why did someone recommend Yasu?"
"It\'s even more surprising that Madam let Yasu stay this long."
"Hey, at least the kid\'s got the guts to not give up and run away.
 Keep it up, Yasu."
"I, I......hate being called Yasu..."
At the very end, ......I finally said the one thing I\'d always wanted to say to them.
However, they basically ignored me, and just picked up their things and left...
"........................"
"......Guess you never got a chance to become friends with them."
"I wouldn\'t even want to."
"Yep.
 I\'m sure they feel the same way, so you\'re even.
 Just forget about those people.
 They don\'t have anything to do with you anymore.
 So, there\'s no reason to give them any more thought."
"............Yeah.
 ......You\'re right."
I felt just a bit disappointed.
I was never able to get them to acknowledge that I\'d become a fully‐fledged servant who could take care of myself.
"It\'s hard for people to throw off their first impressions.
 ......That\'s just how it is.
 No matter how wonderful a person you grow into,
 they would probably always call you Yasu and make fun of you.
 There\'s no reason for you to seek their validation."
"......Yes.
 Yeah, you\'re right, Shannon.
 I\'ll completely forget about those people."
"Good.
 You have two great friends, Kumasawa‐san and me.
 And when the new servants come, you can show them from the start that you can take care of yourself."
Shannon was exactly right.
I regained a sense of confidence and pride that I hadn\'t felt since that day when I held the key with the spiderweb charm up high.
......I am now the most experienced Fukuin servant.
The new servants who come will still probably be older than me,
 but I need to teach them the ropes as the more experienced servant.
Genji‐sama even told me to guide the newer servants...
Okay.
 ......I\'ll give it my all.
"That\'s the right attitude.
 Let\'s give it our all together."
"Yeah!"
"My name is Asne (明日音).
 Pleased to meet you."
"My name is Belne (鐘音).
 Pleased to meet you."
.....................
The newly arrived servants looked......a bit frivolous.
When I first joined the Ushiromiya family, I was incredibly nervous.
However, I couldn\'t see any trace of that nervousness on these girls...
"Yes.
 Usually, kids with good grades and behavior were selected."
"How are they selected?
 Who chooses?"
"People from the board of directors come and interview them.
 And other things are considered like their everyday conduct..."
"So! As long as they acted like good kids in front of the adults, they could pass?"
"......Well,
 ummm,
 ......there were times that they passed because the adults thought they looked suitable..."
"All of the children who came from the Gospel House were highly individualistic.
 Their rough edges would be sanded down as they worked as servants,
 and eventually they would grow to be servants who would not shame the Ushiromiya family."
"However, it was the role of the more experienced servants to encourage this model behavior.
 ......Since I was now the only one with experience, it was my responsibility to guide them."
"What were the new kids like?"
"Elites, no doubt?!
 Of irreproachable conduct!"
"......I think they were like that when Madam and Genji‐sama were around.
 However,
 ......when their superiors weren\'t around, well,
 ......they didn\'t take things quite as seriously..."
"Asne‐san...
 Make sure you put your tools on the cart when you\'re done using them."
"Kyahhahahahaha!
 ......Huh?
 Su~re. So~rry."
As an experienced servant, I also gave them a warning.
"And Belne‐san, you shouldn\'t set your key down in a place like that.
 You\'ll lose it."
"I\'m not gonna lose it.
 I never forget where I put things."
When I first arrived here, the older servants would often tell me off just as I was doing now.
They would probably have been far more mean and obnoxious about it.
I had hated that, so I tried to be more gentle when admonishing them, but they wouldn\'t take me seriously...
"L‐listen up.
 You know there\'s a witch living in the mansion, don\'t you...?"
"Oooh, BEATRICE~!"
"Kyahahahaha! That sounded just like him!"
"Shannon‐chan,
 don\'t tell me you believe in that too?"
"Y‐yes, she really exists...
 If you leave things lying around, the witch will prank you and hide them..."
"It\'s true.
 It\'s gotten me into trouble many times..."
"A witch hiding things?"
"That\'s totally impossible."
"I mean, come on, witches?"
"They don\'t even exist!
 Kyahhahahahaha!"
"They don\'t exist.
 ......Witches."
"......I thought they were just pranks.
 No, ......I think it just gave me peace of mind to think of them that way......while I still could."
"Do you think the witch BEATRICE actually existed...?"
"I don\'t believe it."
"......I don\'t know if it was BEATRICE,
 but I do think that something that wasn\'t human...
...really did exist in that mansion."
"Do you think there\'s a chance that this non‐human thing was BEATRICE...?"
"Ridiculous."
"......I wish I could say it was ridiculous."
"That must have been a prank of Yasu\'s. No, not a prank, revenge."
"I did think that at first, but......"
"Did something happen that couldn\'t be explained away as a prank...?"
"......It was persistent.
 ......And creepy."
"Specifically, what sorts of things happened?"
"Things I set down would disappear as soon as I looked away for a second."
"Didn\'t Yasu just hide them?"
"I thought so at first.
 It was only natural to think that.
 But I started getting this feeling that something wasn\'t right.
 I kept thinking...would a timid kid like that really pull such nasty pranks?"
"Can you tell us what happened?"
"......When my key ring disappeared, it was easy to think that Yasu snatched it when I wasn\'t looking.
 ......But when just a single key disappeared off that key ring...
and reappeared somewhere impossible, I couldn\'t think of it that way."
"Maybe Yasu just pulled that one key off while you weren\'t looking...?"
"Is that even possible?! Practically speaking?!
 Quickly hiding the whole ring is one thing,
 but if you really think about it, taking a single key off a key ring isn\'t that easy!
 The keys would jingle and jangle.
 I was standing right next to them, facing the other way!
 If someone had taken their time to carefully remove a key when I was that close, even an idiot like me would\'ve noticed!"
"But a single key just vanished without a sound.
 ......At that moment, I finally realized.
 This wasn\'t Yasu trying to get back at me,
 ......it was something...
...worse...
than that."
"And where did you find this disappearing key?"
"It was...
......in my locker."
"Belne, you\'re such a ditz sometimes...
 Are you sure you didn\'t just take that key off yourself and forget that you put it in your locker......?"
"Why would I take that one key off the ring?!
 Have you ever taken a key off your key ring, Asne, or put one on?!
 I tried doing it myself.
 It\'s really stiff!
 I would never go to all that trouble.
 There\'s no point in it!
 Am I a sleepwalker or something?!
 How could I not remember something I\'d done?!"
"I may be stupid, but I\'m not that stupid!
 I don\'t forget about things I do that easily!!
 And anyway, I know I had my key with me when I entered the room!
 Otherwise, how could I have unlocked the door?!"
"......Okay then...
 Being careful not to make any sound,
 Yasu must have, um,
 ...slipped the key off,
 and hid it in your locker..."
"That\'s what I thought at first!
 I jumped at Yasu, telling that kid not to mess with me!
 But even as I said it, I realized.
 Isn\'t there something completely wrong here?!"
"I mean, we were with Yasu the whole time that day as we went around cleaning the rooms, right?!
 There\'s no way Yasu had enough time to take a jangly key off the ring!
 It was impossible for Yasu!
 In fact, that would have been impossible for anyone, to remove just a single key in that short amount of time without making a sound!!"
"M‐maybe the ring was missing a master key when you got it..."
"I already told you!!
 The key really was there in the beginning!
 I was the one who unlocked that room!
 So it must have been there!
 ......And then, I went into the room!
 I\'m an idiot who hates hearing the keys clattering around, so I placed the ring on the bed...!"
"Then, when we finished cleaning, I picked up the ring, tried to lock the door, and it was gone!
 I may have turned my back on the ring, but it was right next to me!
 So, if someone tried to pull a prank by removing just one key, I\'d have heard the clinking!
 And yet, just the key for that room vanished and appeared again in my locker!!"
"......So okay, let\'s say that Yasu managed to sneak it away.
 It\'s less stressful to imagine.
 ......But still!
 How could Yasu have put it in my locker, then?!
 We were together with Yasu the whole time, right?!
 When I started yelling about it being gone and ran all over the place looking for it, Yasu was with me until the moment I found it in my locker, get it?!"
"I\'m telling you it\'s impossible!!
 Even as I jumped at Yasu, I began to feel it.
 I mean, Yasu\'s eyes seemed to be saying it silently.
 ......According to Yasu, the reason things used to go missing all the time...
wasn\'t because Yasu was forgetful, as everyone said, ......but actually...
......because impossible things would suddenly happen, just like they had to me,
 ......and.........and...!"
"......Yasu was with you the whole time, so there was no chance for Yasu to put the key in the locker?"
"Did other strange things like that happen?"
"Yeah, they did.
 More stuff went missing, but not just that... Things kept happening, over and over...
 ......Of course, I started getting nervous and being careful not to just leave stuff lying around, ......but that didn\'t help."
"......At first, I was angry at Yasu,
 ......but at some point, I began to realize that I was mistaken.
 One time, a key even disappeared from a ring that was in my pocket!
 Then, I realized.
 ......These weren\'t Yasu\'s pranks.
 The same thing that had happened to Yasu was now happening to me...!"
"C‐calm down a bit...
 I think some of those were Yasu\'s pranks,
 ...and the others were just you being clumsy.
 ......It\'s true that the mansion\'s always dark and eerie,
 ......and it does feel like the sort of place you\'d find a curse.
 I\'m sure that\'s what made you scared like that..."
"You saw it too, didn\'t you?!
 Remember that white shadow we saw vanish into the VIP room that rainy day?!"
"......Y‐yes, I saw,
 but couldn\'t that just have been Madam or Milady wearing something white...?"
"What do you mean, something white?!
 Have you ever seen either of them wearing something like that?!
 And besides, that VIP room is always locked!
 They don\'t have keys to it!
 That had to have been some kind of ghost or evil spirit...
...no, the silhouette of the witch!"
"........................
 ......Ha...hahaha...
 So, as you can see, ......Belne started acting like this at one point.
 Totally scared.
 ......I\'ve got more street smarts than her,
 so the more scared she became, the more strongly I felt that this whole thing was stupid and witches couldn\'t exist."
"......Still, I had to be careful about what I said.
 ......I mean, I was starting to realize that this wasn\'t something I should talk about carelessly.
 ......All ghost stories and curses sound stupid to outsiders.
 ......But to the people who believe in them, it\'s absolutely not a joking matter.
 It really was......no joke."
"......Asne didn\'t believe a word of what I said.
 So, I eventually stopped telling Asne about it......and confessed to Yasu instead.
 I told Yasu "I thought you were the culprit, but it couldn\'t have been you".
 I said that something...
...strange...was happening to me...!"
"......And what was the reply?"
"Yasu said that the same thing had happened many times before, but no one would believe it...!
 Besides, even though the older servants always made fun of Yasu, I knew that Yasu wasn\'t as clumsy or stupid as they said."
"I hated being bossed around by a younger person, so I always fought back, but Yasu did have the job pretty much down pat.
 I\'d always thought it strange that people made so much fun of Yasu for losing things...!"
"I was then sure.
 It "existed"!
 Some strange, inhuman thing "existed" in this mansion!"
"And that was the witch BEATRICE...?"
"If BEATRICE is what you want to call it, then I believe in BEATRICE!
 Anyway, something that can\'t be explained away by human actions definitely "existed" there!
 People who didn\'t understand kept calling Yasu and me forgetful!
 They didn\'t get it... They just didn\'t get it!!"
"......B‐but still,
 ......you got a little scared, but it spooked you into shaping up, didn\'t it?
 And then all that fuss about you losing things went away, right...?
 So it must have been your imagination all the time......"
"You\'re wrong!!
 I talked to Yasu, Shannon, and Kumasawa‐san about it!
 And they said that the witch really did exist...
 That all the old servants make sure to respect her!"
"They said I had been cursed because I\'d stupidly gone around saying that BEATRICE didn\'t exist...!
 So I reformed!
 Yasu taught me how to give offerings to the doll in the VIP room!
 I asked Genji‐sama for permission and prayed at the shrine on the reef!
 And then it all stopped, all at once!!"
"You were okay, Asne, since you stopped making fun of the witch,
 but if you\'d cluelessly gone on making fun of her, you would surely have been cursed next!
 Yes, I guarantee it! You definitely would have been cursed...!!"
".........Yeah,
 .....that kind of stuff makes even me uncomfortable...
 ......Though I\'d never say it to their faces..."
"You just don\'t get it!
 You really don\'t!!
 So, I made sure to teach all the newer servants well!
 A witch called BEATRICE‐sama lives in this mansion...!
 If you make fun of her, you really will be cursed...!!"
".....................Belne..."
"When things, you know, ......disappear, that\'s a sign that the witch is close by and watching us...
 If you say it\'s a prank, or that witches aren\'t real,
 you\'ll be cursed even more...!!
 It was like that for both Yasu and me!
 Whenever a key vanishes,
 ......that\'s a sign that the witch has appeared...!!"
Belne‐san carelessly tossed her key ring on the bed again, humming as she started to clean...
No matter how much I warn her, she doesn\'t change her ways.
 She\'s always making fun of me and calling me Yasu, so she won\'t listen to what I tell her......
Why won\'t she listen to what I say...?
You mustn\'t leave things lying carelessly about.
 If you lower your guard, the witch will prank you......
"......Ahyahhyahhya!
 Look at that delicious key ring lying out there in the open......"
"St‐stop it, please...!
 That\'s Belne‐san\'s key!
 Keep your pranking to me alone.
 Let the others be......!"
"You have become so cautious lately that you are no longer fun.
 ......*cackle*cackle*, I jest, of course."
"Still, how unpleasant these people are, refusing to listen to my friend\'s kindly advice.
 Any insult to my friend, I take as an insult to myself...!"
"......Are you planning to steal Belne‐san\'s key...?
 Please, don\'t do it...!
 She\'ll think I hid it again...!"
"She thinks my magic is naught but the work of a child like you...?!
 *cackle*cackle*, very well, then.
 I shall simply show her a feat impossible for Humans to perform...!"
"I shall show her my magic!!
 Foolish Belne, if that is your name!
 You will regret that you did not heed the warnings given you by my friend!
 This flimsy body of mine will not do the trick! I\'m borrowing yours!!
 It\'s been too long since I last demonstrated real magic!
 Let my body return for a spell......to the land of the living!"
"Huh?
 Ah, ..................!"
A shiver ran up my whole body like an electric shock.
From that moment onwards, ......I couldn\'t move any part of my body by my own will.
Like a moment of shock after a blackout,
 I could do nothing but accept the fact that I had lost control over my body......
All of the cells throughout my body felt tingly.
 ......It felt as though my body had been transformed into someone else\'s.
......I realized that the witch BEATRICE was using my body as a vessel to revive for a short period of time...
"......Hmm, very nice.
 That ticklish feeling of the air on my skin... Having a body is simply wonderful!"
Wh‐......what are you trying to do?!
 Please, don\'t do anything mean......
This time, everything was backwards.
 My words were spoken inside my heart.
 And the witch\'s voice was coming out of my mouth...!
"Fear not.
 I will return your body soon enough.
 I just need to teach her a lesson with a little prank.
 However, it will not be one so simple that suspicion could fall on you...!
 Come, try to remember.
 Where have you been sleeping?!"
Everything went completely white and my mind stopped.
Once again, that tingling sensation slid up my body.
I could feel it all gather in the fingers of both my hands, ......and come out through my fingertips.
It was an incomprehensible,
 indescribable,
 ......unknown sensation.
My head went blank, and I couldn\'t think at all.
I could do nothing......but abandon my soul to the sensation.
I finally understood.
 This is...
......what it\'s like...
to use magic......
"Come, try to remember.
 Where have you been sleeping......?"
My fingers moved like a puppet\'s, and danced around as though I was a conductor—not of music, but of magic.
I never knew that having my body move without my control could be so exciting...
When Beato lifted my finger as if a string was attached to it,
 the key ring lying on the bed stood on end.
......Belne‐san...didn\'t notice.
 ......Neither did Asne‐san.
They were fully occupied by their happy chat as they cleaned the room...
I doubt that either of them could have dreamed that a witch was right behind them,
 readying herself to use magic.
They could never have imagined...
...that the key ring was doing a little dance right behind their backs.
It was like an anime fairy tale I\'d seen once as a kid.
The happy way the keys danced and spun made it look as though they had a will of their own.
I could feel the fun of making those keys dance with my fingers wash over me...
Yes, this is...pleasure......
As I powerlessly watched the witch control me,
 ......I couldn\'t help but surrender myself to this new joy called magic......
"Whoops, that\'s no good.
 If the whole ring disappears, my friend will be suspected again.
 ......All we need to disappear is...
...yes, just the key to this room."
Beato controlled my fingers, controlling the magic.
 ......And thereby controlling the keys.
The key ring slumped down on the bed,
 .........and then just the mansion\'s master key stood on end.
"Well now, what shall I do with this?
 ......Just erasing it would be terribly dull.
 So, ............*cackle*cackle*!
 Why don\'t I throw it into her locker?!
 That way, I\'ll give my friend, who\'s been working here with her the whole time, a perfect alibi!"
"Come, try to remember.
 Where have you been sleeping?!
 Yes, it was a warm, dark place..."
"The inside of Belne\'s locker!!
 *cackle*cackle*cackle*!!"
When Beato snapped her fingers, the key burst and became a gold butterfly.
......A gold butterfly...?
I see, it\'s gold because she\'s the Golden Witch, who gave the Master all of his gold.
And butterflies are scared of spiderwebs.
 ......So, it\'s a gold butterfly.
The minions of the witch BEATRICE...are gold butterflies......
After flitting into the air, it burst into a shower of gold sparks and disappeared.
Then, the vanished key......went to Belne‐san\'s locker......
Though it was far away, in the locker of a changing room, I had a vivid understanding of its new state.
It wasn\'t by sight or by touch.
It was by some other sense inside my heart, which couldn\'t be explained by the five senses.
A completely new sensation that I\'d never felt before.
It was the completely alien concept...called magic.
A completely unknown pleasure that left me in a trance.
"......It is done, my friend.
 I shall return this body to you..."
Nn, ..................ah......
"..........................."
It felt as though I had been spinning through space,
 and gravity had suddenly come back and thrown me to the ground.
Like when you\'re having a great dream, but you\'re suddenly woken up,
 ......and all you can remember about the dream was that it was fun.
 ......That sort of lonely feeling.
Though Beato had been borrowing my body, it was my own body that used magic.
I could still feel that sensation in my hands.
The key ring over there had danced along with the movements of my fingers.
No, that\'s not quite it.
 The key ring and my fingers had danced together.
That fun, that excitement...
...still tingled slightly in my hands......
"Whoops, that was close."
Saying this, Belne‐san suddenly turned around and picked up the key ring she had thrown down on the bed.
She must have realized that I was staring at it.
"Almost had Yasu complain that I shouldn\'t leave keys lying about like this.
 I\'d never put something down and forget about it."
With a grin, she put the key back into her pocket.
However, she still hadn\'t noticed.
She probably couldn\'t even imagine that during the few moments her guard was down...
...just a single key had vanished from the ring...
It\'s not easy for a Human to do things like that.
......But, with magic...
With just a little dance of the keys and a butterfly popping, ......it had disappeared.
"Alright, fingertip inspection!
 Bed, okay.
 Curtains, okay!"
"Tools, okay.
 And keys too!
 See?
 Nothing wrong, right?"
"Y‐yes, that\'s good......
 Then let\'s go on to the next room.
 ......Ah, ......Belne‐san.
 Could you......lock up this room for me?"
"Hmm?
 Su~re."
.........Did Belne‐san\'s key...
...really disappear by magic?
Was that fun magic just a daydream I had......?
I was so scared of that being true......that I tested it.
"...........................
 ...............Huh......?"
"What\'s wrong?
 Why\'re you taking so long?"
".........Huh?
 .........Huh? Huh??
 ......Wait, are you kidding me?"
"What\'s wrong...?"
"......It\'s not this one.
 ......And it isn\'t this one.
 ......Huh?
 What the...?"
"What is it?
 Do you want me to lock it?"
"I, I don\'t get it?
 What\'s going on?
 ......My master key\'s gone.
 Just my master key is gone.
 Wh‐why...?!
 This ring\'s so stiff... There\'s no way it\'d come off......!"
I could faintly feel that tingling sensation...
in the tips of my fingers......
That night.
......As I gazed at the ceiling from the bed in my dorm room,
 ......I looked at my hands.
 I couldn\'t sleep.
The excitement from the time those keys danced was still there in my fingers...
Is this...
...how BEATRICE...
...how witches...
...always feel?
............I have a witch friend called BEATRICE.
She always used to pull pranks on me with her strange magic.
Because I saw this all the time,
 .........I thought I knew what magic was.
But today...
.....she had possessed my body......and used magic with it.
The sensation of magic that I finally felt at that time......still held my heart entranced.
It was a completely unknown pleasure.
After all......
With a movement of my fingertips,
 .........the key had danced on command.
It was an mysterious, wondrous miracle of magic—something no Human could do.
I still couldn\'t let go of that excitement...
........................
".........Shannon.
 .........Are you awake...?"
".....................
 ......What\'s up?"
Shannon was still awake.
Shannon is always early to bed, early to rise.
 By getting to bed early, all of her weariness disappears by the next day.
......She lives a model life, one that all servants should respect and admire.
......If I wanted to become a beloved and respected servant like Shannon,
 .........I would need to act that way too.
However, ......I had no confidence that I could do that anymore.
"I guess...
.........I can\'t become like you after all."
"......What do you mean?
 This is a bit abrupt."
"You were my ideal.
 Always."
".........Yeah."
"At the Gospel House, you were kind to everyone and loved by everyone.
 ......You would always play with me, and you were my only friend.
 And at the Ushiromiya mansion, you were a wonderful servant, who could carry out any task flawlessly and gracefully.
 My idol and goal.
 ......That\'s what you were."
"Yeah.
 ......Let\'s give it our all together.
 As they say, perseverance prevails.
 You\'re gaining recognition from everyone now.
 So let\'s aim to become wonderful servants together."
"..................
 ......I\'m...done with being a servant."
"......Huh?"
"Instead of a servant,
 ......I think it\'d be more fun to be a witch."
"A, a witch...?
 ...What do you mean...?"
"A servant who everyone loves and relies upon is...
...yeah, it\'s still something I\'d love to be.
 ......But right now,
 .........I want to be a witch...
even more."
"Well, that\'s...
...ummm...
 .........Huh......?"
Shannon was confused.
It was hardly surprising.
 ......All this about quitting as a servant was at least understandable.
But she didn\'t know how to answer after hearing that her roommate wanted to become a witch...
"A witch.
 BEATRICE.
 ......You see, today, BEATRICE possessed me and used my body to do magic.
 That unknown world felt so......thrilling.
 It was far, far more thrilling than even the time I learned that I\'d been selected as an Ushiromiya family servant."
"It was like learning about a new world.
 ......As though I\'d been living in a world of darkness all my life and thought I knew what the world was like,
 then finally learned what light was and saw the world for the first time.
 It was...joy.
 ......Excitement."
At that time, Beato had only used my fingers, made a key ring dance,
 and turned a key into a butterfly before hiding it in a locker.
But I had understood it with my body.
If I had moved my fingers a different way, the ring could have flown into the air instead of just dancing,
 and I could have turned it into a scurrying lizard instead of a butterfly. ......I could have done anything.
True, BEATRICE\'s magical power was still weak.
It had all happened in the little world behind the backs of the servants filled with the anti‐magic toxin.
However, inside that tiny, short‐lived world, I could have done anything at all.
Beato just happened to settle on making the keys dance and turning one into a butterfly.
But if she wanted to, she could have done anything else!
The endless sensation of that free, unrestricted power...
I could still feel it in my fingertips.
Could it be that, along with that sensation, a sliver of that magical power might also remain...?
I can tell.
 It\'s still there.
 .........There\'s still just a bit of it there, along with that sensation.
I can do it.
 ......I can still.........do it......
"............Ah......"
A single spot of golden light suddenly lit up in this dark room.
It was right between my clasped hands.
When I slowly opened them,
 ......I could see a single dot that sparkled gold.
"What...
......is...
......?"
Shannon didn\'t know what the light meant.
How could light appear from the palms of my hands?
And yet, even with this miracle right in front of her,
 ......she couldn\'t understand what it was.
She just sat there with her mouth open in disbelief.
However, to me,
 ......this was just the return of that bit of sensation in my fingertips.
The golden dot...
...spread out...
...and became a small, gold butterfly.
It flapped its wings and scattered gold sparks about like Tinker Bell.
To Shannon, it probably just looked as though a gold butterfly was flapping its wings.
......Of course, that alone was a miracle that she could hardly grasp.
But to me, it was like a remote‐control plane in the shape of a butterfly.
I could control that gold butterfly however I wanted.
Not clumsily with threads.
......I could make it flap, dance, play through the air as I wished.
I was taking a walk through the air as that little butterfly.
The golden glint of it pierced the darkness of the small room as it danced about freely.
 ......It was an entrancing pleasure.
......However, that sensation in my fingers began to weaken.
I could tell that the few magic butterfly scales left in my fingers were going away.
Finally, like a sparkler burning out, the gold butterfly gave out one last blink of light,
 fell down as a single golden dot, and disappeared without a trace......
"Wh‐what on Earth just happened......"
"This is magic.
 .........It\'s really fun."
"M‐.........magic............"
"Yeah.
 Magic.
 ......I was able to use it just now because there was still a little left in my fingers.
 ......But if I became a real witch, ......I\'d be able to use it whenever and however I wanted......to do anything.
 Now that I\'ve learned how fun this can be,
 I don\'t want to go back to being Human.
 Being a servant is just too boring.
 So, ......I\'m going to become a witch."
"B‐become a witch...
 ............W‐wait......!"
"I\'ve already made my decision, Shannon.
 It\'s been fun.
 I\'ll give you this room.
 You can use it by yourself.
 Later.
 Goodbye."
"W‐wait...!!"
As Shannon called out repeatedly for me to wait, ......a massive planetarium swallowed me up.
In the sea of the pitch‐black starry sky, I was alone.
 I...we...are alone here.
"I\'m done acting the part of a servant.
 .........I\'m going to...modify the world."
".........Mm.
 Understood.
 In that case, how would you like it to be?"
"Being a wonderful servant like Shannon wouldn\'t be bad.
 ......But now that I know how fun it is to be a witch, that feels like a boring dream.
 I can\'t go back anymore."
"What will happen to Shannon?"
"......Shannon can just be Shannon, and stay as a respected servant.
 She\'ll stay the same.
 But from now on, it won\'t be the two of us together, but her alone."
"Partings can be so sudden.
 ......Ah, well.
 Being fickle makes life more entertaining.
 Then what will you do instead?"
"I want to be a witch.
 I want to be Beato."
"But I am already BEATRICE."
"Your backstory that you\'re a witch and my friend will remain the same,
 but I\'ll modify the world so that Beato is me."
"Would I then be a witch who is a friend of BEATRICE?"
"Pretty much.
 So, from now on, you\'re a different witch."
"Very well.
 Then, what will be my new name?"
".....................
 I\'ll put that on hold until I can think of one.
 You\'ll be nameless for a while.
 Sorry about that."
"Worry not, worry not.
 It is to be my name, after all.
 You had better take your time and think carefully about it.
 *cackle*."
"You\'ll be BEATRICE\'s friend that she\'s had since she was young and couldn\'t use magic yet.
 It started with you hiding my things to tease me."
"I see.
 And when BEATRICE finally learns magic, I become a friend on an equal footing with her.
 So, I should act like a big sister sort of friend."
"Yeah, like that.
 ......What should we do about how we talk?"
"It seems that "warawa" has become firmly established as the way BEATRICE refers to herself.
 Should I relinquish that to you?"
"Yeah.
 That haughty way of speaking with "warawa" will be mine."
"Hmm, very well.
 Then I shall—no, I can\'t speak like that any more.
 ......Then I need to find a good way to sound like BEATRICE\'s big‐sister‐like witch friend."
"Yeah.
 ......Or should it be...
.........very well."
"Ahahahaha.
 Now there\'s a nice, dignified voice."
"What about the way I—let\'s try that again.
 And what of my appearance?"
"Good point.
 I\'ve got a sort of blood‐red witch look.
 Why not choose a different color for yourself?"
"......When BEATRICE wanders the mansion at night, she is often seen dressed in white."
"Of course, ghosts are classically white."
"A white dress...
...on a witch......
 .........Let\'s try putting it all together."
I need a different look than the witch in the demon‐red dress.
A white, noble witch.
......Unlike the time with the red witch, I\'m thinking about my own look now,
 ......so I\'d like to make it beautiful and......cute if I can.
A white dress.
 A noble look.
Like one of noble blood, but with a dark, sarcastic streak......
No, she\'s like a tomboy princess, so her voice is a mix of formality and rudeness.
Then the dress should be the exact opposite, pure and clean, to make a nice contrast......
"..............................
 ......How does this form suit me?"
"Is this the form of the new BEATRICE?!"
"How beautiful!
 Just like a noble princess!"
"Hmmm...
 ...I\'ve taken a liking to this form.
 Not bad at all."
"......Looking good.
 That\'s wonderful, Beato."
"Hmm. I like it.
 I truly do like this form..."
"Now, if you can keep this up and give me a wonderful name, that\'d be great.
 If I have to go around nameless for too long, I\'ll get all sulky."
"Fear not, I shall find you a splendid name!
 But first, there is something I must consider: what shall be the form of my magic?!"
"Hiding objects and transporting them instantaneously is your theme.
 So, I must think of my own particular theme of magic.
 ......When I use magic, gold butterflies will flit about.
 I\'m not backing down on that part...!"
"*giggle*. Splendid.
 Just perfect for the Golden Witch.
 ......Then the weaknesses such as spiderwebs and the sacred mirror in the shrine will also go to you?"
"Hmm.
 Even an all‐powerful witch needs a few small weaknesses to keep things interesting.
 Then let us do it like so.
 If I touch a spiderweb, it will burn me."
Silently, a silvery spider dropped down vertically.
Beato, now in her new form, lightly touched the silver spiderweb that trailed out behind it.
As she did, ......there was a faint sound of flesh burning, and a thin burn was left across her fingers.
BEATRICE can\'t stand spiderwebs.
That was one of the weaknesses of the evil spirits Kumasawa‐san spoke of.
Since the witch BEATRICE had revived thanks to the power of those evil spirits,
 she also inherited their weaknesses.
So, the sacred mirror is also one of her weaknesses.
......However, I am unlikely to cross paths with that sacred mirror in the shrine very often.
That\'s not very fun.
".........Then, while mirrors with sacred power will obviously be a weakness, let us make mirrors in general a weakness too."
"They do often say that mirrors have magical powers.
 Good idea, I think.
 Sounds just like a witch."
"Let us say that I cannot abide mirrors because when I look at one, it feels as though my magical power is being sucked out.
 Hmm, that sounds quite entertaining."
......Now that I really think about it,
 I\'ll be bad with mirrors whether I invent a story for it or not.
No matter who I want or strive to be,
 ......the only face that will ever show in a mirror...
is the heartlessly pathetic and realistic face of "Yasu".
Mirrors, which will always force me to face my shabby reality, are something I always want to avoid.
That\'s right.
 ......I hate mirrors.
......I don\'t want to look at...
my own...
pitiful self.
"You don\'t need to decide everything at once.
 It\'s fun to build up a world one little bit at a time."
"True.
 I understand.
 I shall enjoy life as a witch as I slowly expand my world."
"That tiny, dark room is no place for you to sleep now."
"Indeed.
 I am the Golden Witch!
 I am the ruler of Rokkenjima\'s night, and the nighttime mansion belongs to me.
 That is where I should be living, is it not?"
"A room for BEATRICE?
 Haha, isn\'t it obvious?!"
"Yeah, that\'s right!
 That wonderful room on the second floor of the mansion......"
"The VIP room of the witch—that is BEATRICE\'s room!"
"Oh, so it is.
 From this evening forward, that room in the nighttime mansion shall be my dwelling place...!
 Why didn\'t I think of that myself, hahaha, hehahahahahahahaha...!!"
"Then let\'s go, Beato.
 If we\'re going to drink tea together, we\'ll need a much better room than that cramped one."
"Indeed.
 That room is too crude to welcome friends to and serve tea in.
 We shall change rooms.
 Let us go, my friend...!"
".........So, this is goodbye to Shannon."
When I looked at my feet, ......I could see my own dorm room far beneath me.
I could see Shannon, who had dashed up to the bed I lay on and had been saying "wait" at the moment time froze.
 She was as rigid as a doll.
Looking down at it from this height, it really did look like a small dollhouse...
"Farewell, Shannon.
 ......The days I spent as a Human, growing our friendship as I attempted to emulate you, were truly fun.
 ...If I had never learned the joys of magic and awakened as a witch,
 everything would doubtless have remained as it was."
 .........I was your only close friend as well, wasn\'t I?
Please forgive me for erasing that friend so suddenly.
As a parting gift, ......I will erase "me" from your world.
Starting now, this will not be a two‐person room.
It will be a single‐person room, with just you in it.
Strive to be a kind, reliable servant loved by everyone,
 and embody that ideal as you always have.
Yasu, the stupid, clumsy servant who lost things all the time, no longer exists.
Farewell, Shannon.
When I mature as the witch BEATRICE and wander freely about the nighttime mansion,
 ......I may bump into you as you do your nighttime rounds.
However, when I meet you again,
 it will not be a reunion.
It will be our first meeting.
After all, though you have heard the rumors about the witch BEATRICE, you have never met her......
Farewell, Shannon.
Let us meet again sometime and spin up some fun tale.........
"Wait......!!
 Wai...
.........t...
............
 ..........................."
....................................
.........What...
...was I doing...?
Was I......talking in my sleep......?
Apparently, I had gotten out of bed, stretched my hand out towards it,
 ......and said "wait".
This isn\'t the first time I\'ve woken myself up by saying something strange in my sleep, but...
......I don\'t remember ever waking up to find myself out of bed and standing up.
Could this be what they call......sleepwalking...?
Am I just tired......?
......Gotta sleep.
 Gotta get back to sleep.
I turned around to face my bed.
............?
My bed wasn\'t there.
There was no bed in this room except the one I had just turned my back on.
If I\'m the only one in this room, and the only bed is the one behind me,
 ......that must mean it\'s my bed.
......That feels wrong, for some reason.
The bed sheets are all disarranged, as though someone slipped out of them.
"Someone"...?
 This is my own, single‐person room.
So, that there is my bed, and the rumpled sheets mean...
that I was just sleeping there until a second ago, don\'t they...?
......But, for some reason,
 .........that bed...
...doesn\'t feel like my bed.
But I, Shannon, have a single‐person room—I was the only person to be given one while all the other kids had to share.
So, there\'s only one bed.
And it must be mine.
...........................
".........Am I just...
...tired?
 ......I wonder..."
I must just be half‐asleep.
 I have school again first thing tomorrow.
And after school, I\'ll go to the mansion, help out with some work,
 and then I want to talk to Kumasawa‐san about the mystery novel I just read.
"Time to sleep.
 I\'m probably just so worn out that I\'m imagining things.
 .........Good night, Shannon.
 Just crawl in bed and close your eyes...
...and you won\'t have to think about anything complicated......"
I went back into my bed.
It felt a bit uncomfortable to crawl into a bed that wasn\'t mine.
Still, it might just be because I\'m getting so sleepy, but it\'s starting to feel as though this is my bed after all.
.........I\'m just half‐asleep......
I am...Shannon.
 A lonely servant.
I mess up from time to time,
 ......but I want to become a kind servant whom everyone loves......
.........Goodnight,
 .........me.........
 Oh, I am one yet many.
I have grown tired of playing the servant.
 I have grown tired of playing the Human!
From this moment forth, from this night forth, I am BEATRICE!
The Golden Witch BEATRICE, who has lived for a thousand years!
Praise me, servants.
 Have fear when you are chosen for the night shift!
On the nighttime island, the mansion is my place, and that is my time...!
Oh, I am one yet many!
Yes, let our world swallow up everything.
 It is like the raging seas!
Well now, let us drink the mysterious moon dry tonight, with this Human book as a side dish!
You call this mystery?
 You call this a locked room?
 You call this "a crime impossible for Humans"?
Don\'t make me laugh!
 With all these holes and weak points, you call this a crime impossible for Humans?!
Is there no splendid locked‐room magic capable of astonishing me?
Oh, not here, not there, not this, not that, all of them pathetic!
It draws out a chuckle, but leaves me unsure which is the side dish, the moon or the book?!
If I get tired of mystery, I can change myself into a butterfly!
 I can flit about the island,
 the mansion, the vast forest at will!
 I\'ll follow those cowardly servants as they do their nighttime rounds,
 and when they check to see that a window is locked, they\'ll see me laughing at them in the reflection on the glass!
I can be fickle, and do as I please!
Pranks at night will probably be a lot of fun.
Yes, my mind is made up—I will play like that starting tonight!
*cackle*cackle*, how pleasurable!
 Tonight will truly be pleasurable!
In the world of witches, the only limits to your fun are the limits of your imagination!
My imagination shall become the source of my magical power!
Very well, then—this will be fun!
 I shall allow my imagination to grow without bound.
 And with it, I shall swallow up the entire island.
 All nights on this island belong to me!!
Oh, how refined and pleasant are the days of a witch!
Oh, I am one yet many!
 Kihahahahahahhha, hyahhaha!!
Here\'s to the wonderful world of witches!!
