The biggest event for the Ushiromiya family in fall was the family conference in October,
 but for Jessica, there was another one before that: the school cultural festival.
Jessica liked school; to her, it was a place where she could let out the stress she\'d built up during the rigid lifestyle she was forced to lead at home.
For the cultural festival today, she had formed a group with her friends,
 and would be performing casual pop‐rock on a temporary stage.
She had kept on preparing and practicing for that, and was really looking forward to today,
 .........but there was one thing that had been worrying her.
She looked at the clock.
 ...There was still a little time, ...but she was uneasy.
Would he really come?
As she was about to breathe out a stress‐relieving sigh, her heart jumped as all her friends suddenly started speaking in shrill voices.
"No wayyyy, Hina\'s boyfriend\'s a to~tal stud!!"
"He totally is, right?!
 He totally is, right?!"
"Rin, your boyfriend looks hella smart!
 So the guy\'s a hard S with glasses?! Like, for real?!"
"No way, no way, my man\'s a gyaru‐o!"
"""*giggle*♪ *giggle*♪"""
......It\'s not necessarily the case that all girls are like this,
 ...but at Jessica\'s school at least, the cultural festival was really a boyfriend exhibition.
Jessica didn\'t have a boyfriend.
She had many friends of the opposite sex, but no "special one".
...But Jessica was a little famous around the school, and everyone naturally expected that she had a fitting partner.
Furthermore, her pride had caused her to act like that was the case.
Through such acting and dodging of questions, she had somehow managed to keep up the bluff until this year.
......But for various reasons, she hadn\'t been able to escape this year\'s cultural festival...
"Jessie~.
 Is your boyfriend he~re?"
"Hweh?!
 Ah, ah, no, looks like he\'s not here yet.
 Maybe he\'s busy with work?
 Ahahahahahahahahahaha..."
"What kind of guy is your boyfriend, Jessie?
 At least give us a hint.
 What type is he?
 What type is he?!"
"Awesome, he\'s a working man, right?!
 Is he gonna come in a suit?!
 Of course he\'s gonna be sporting glasses, right?!
 Kyaaa!!"
"Heeeeeey, but you don\'t really have one, do you?
 If you come clean now, I\'ll let you join me!
 Let\'s both flood this cultural festival with teeeeears!"
"No no no, I do I do I do, I\'m telling you, I really do...
 Ahahahahahahahahahaha...!!"
Jessica laughed awkwardly, covered with cold sweat.
 ...It was extremely doubtful whether she really had deceived her sharp‐witted friends...
"Yes.
 Then, how about making a fake boyfriend and taking him with you?"
"F‐f‐fake?!
 Wh‐who......?!
 I can\'t think of anyone...!"
Shannon\'s ridiculous plan surprised Jessica wildly.
Even so, it was a little more realistic than the unrealistic method running through her head of getting a boyfriend in a huge hurry before the day of the cultural festival.
"For example,
 ......what about Kanon‐kun?"
"K‐K‐Kanon‐kuuuuuun?!
 N‐n‐no way, no way!!
 And anyway I\'m sure Kanon‐kun will have work on the day of the festival—
I don\'t want to bother him and stuff..."
"Of course, I\'ve already checked the schedule.
 Kanon‐kun has that day off."
"......Wh‐...why are you always so clever at times like this...
 No, wait!
 It\'d be even worse if he\'s off...
 I can\'t pull him away from his precious break just for my own vanity!"
"If Kanon‐kun isn\'t pulled away, he\'ll always just be shut away by himself,
 so I think forcibly dragging him around a bit would be perfect."
"Y‐y‐
......you think so?
 ...No,
 but,
 ...I\'d feel bad for Kanon‐kun......"
"Then I think you\'re out of options...
 How about meekly confessing to everyone that you don\'t have a boyfriend?"
"...Oh, sure, sure, that may well cause you to experience some shame,
 but you would only have to endure for the short and yet oh so loooong time before graduation.
 To those couples in love, there\'s no sweeter honey than the face of a single person with an inferiority complex☆"
"Sha‐Shannonnnn~!!
 You aren\'t really worrying for my sake, are you, you\'re teasing meeeeee!!"
Jessica wrestled about with Shannon, her eyes teary.
But Shannon was unconcerned, laughing with her usual smile.
"Yes,
 this is to get you back for making fun of me and George‐sama all the time."
At that comeback of Shannon\'s, the likes of which didn\'t happen even once a year, Jessica rolled around on her bed hugging her cushion, writhing and suffering.
Shannon\'s triumphant smile was unbearably frustrating, but right now, she was the only person Jessica could talk with.
 She could wait until later to suffocate her with a cushion.
"Why not, Milady?
 It\'s a cultural festival, but it\'s also a chance for you to have fun with Kanon‐kun."
"Well yeah, but...
ahh, nononono......!!"
Jessica buried her head in her favorite cushion to hide the fact that her face had grown bright red.
And she bit away at her thumbnail...
...It really was a reaction to be appreciated.
Shannon and Jessica were about the same age, of the same sex, and they were also friends.
And they were both right in the middle of puberty.
They could never talk enough about things related to love.
That\'s why they were able to be open with each other about these topics.
So Jessica had heard in detail about how Shannon\'s and George\'s love was progressing,
 and on the other side, Shannon had heard the details of what type Jessica liked, and what kind of man she might be interested in.
Judging by Jessica\'s reactions, it would probably be crude to talk about that in detail...
But we won\'t get anywhere with Jessica just rolling around on the bed forever, so—to be blunt—
Jessica had been thinking about Kanon ever since he had first appeared.
There were almost no young men on Rokkenjima.
So maybe it was natural that Jessica, as a girl in puberty, had become interested in Kanon.
But if anyone said that, it would destroy the romance of a maiden\'s pure heart and of love at first sight.
Shannon had been with Kanon the whole time at the welfare institute, so she had known him before they had started working.
So Jessica had asked persistently about what kind of person he was, what his hobbies were, what his favorite foods were, what type of girl he liked.
.........Even Shannon could clearly tell that Jessica was infatuated with Kanon.
"Come on.
 ...Isn\'t this a good chance to take Kanon‐kun on a date?"
"B‐b‐but but but...Kanon‐kun might also have someone he likes...
 Wouldn\'t he take it badly if I made him go with me just to show off...?"
"People who aren\'t honest about their feelings, such as you, Milady,
 ...what was that word again, I learned it from George‐sama.
 That\'s right, they call them "tsundora".
 Apparently they will be quite popular a few decades from now, you know?"
"Wowww, George nii‐san sure is incredible...
 So, he\'s capable of foreseeing future trends now, is he?
 Awesome.
 ......No, wait!
 You\'re saying I\'m living in the wrong time period!"
"Waah, waah, waah, I\'m dooooomed!!"
......Ultimately, Jessica wasted several days before finally agreeing to the plan of having Kanon pretend to be her boyfriend......
"......Yes, Milady.
 Did you call me?"
Jessica realized that she had called him at a bad time, and immediately regretted it.
...Kanon always had a sour look, but even so, he had some good days and some bad days.
...Unfortunately, this reaction was the latter.
"N‐n‐no, umm, well,
 ............errr."
"....................."
All that confidence and effort she had amassed by practicing in front of a mirror all night was wiped out in about five seconds...
Jessica turned bright red and hung her head.
Watching her, Kanon sighed.
...Jessica thought he was getting fed up with her, and her face went pale.
".........I heard from Shannon.
 Is this about me accompanying you to the school cultural festival, Milady?"
"Huh?
 ......Ah, aaaaaaahhh!!
 Nice, Shannon...!
 ...I mean...!"
"Ye‐yeah, yeah.
 Tha‐that\'s right, but, umm, err!
 ...............Do, do you have any p‐plans that day...?"
"...I was strictly ordered by Shannon to work specially for you on that day, Milady.
 I have never been to high school, so I don\'t really understand,
 but I hear it\'s a place where girls feel very ashamed if they don\'t have a boy with them."
"...And I was particularly ordered to see to it that the daughter of the Ushiromiya family is in no way inferior to the common people."
"Waha...
wahahahahahahahahahaha, Shannon, I\'ll beat you to death laterrrrrrr!!!"
Jessica kept yelling with a strange voice, a broken smile, and steam pouring from her head as if she were a boiler.
As Kanon watched this, he sighed again.
Kanon wasn\'t an idiot either.
He fully understood what Jessica intended by inviting him.
......However, in truth, he found it nothing but bothersome to go along with the lady\'s game of love.
But Shannon had spoken to him persistently about it.
 He was very indebted to her for many things.
He couldn\'t refuse.
...And in his pocket was that brooch.
Couldn\'t this strange turn of events also have been brought about by the magic power residing in this brooch?
............Ridiculous.
But those words of Shannon\'s came to mind.
...What did Shannon {y:1:‘see’}{n:1:see} that I cannot?
I don\'t understand Shannon\'s feelings.
 We are furniture.
...As if we could...become something more than that.
Jessica, still rambling on in a strange voice, and Kanon, sighing deeply, were a truly odd combination...
"Jessie, someone\'s here for you!!
 Didn\'t you hear?!"
"Huh, ah, ah, sorry!!
 Wh‐who...?"
As my friends all gathered together, ...they were looking this way with hard‐to‐describe expressions,
 whispering to each other in low voices that couldn\'t be called low.
Even I felt kind of shameless.
 Did I just say "sorry, who"?!
Like I don\'t know who\'s shown up...!
Aaaaaaaaah, crap, crap, crap, my mind is blank...
"Omigod, that\'s Jessie\'s boyfriend?!
 He\'s sooo cuuuuuuuuute!!"
"She really had a boyfriend?!
 No fake, serious, for reeeeal?!"
"Jessica, you traitoorrr!!
 He\'s soo fine!!"
"He\'s younger?!
 I never heard he was younger?!"
"Where where?!
 Where where where\'s Jessie\'s boyfriend?!"
"She really does like young boys!!!!!"
"He‐hhhhhey!
 Y‐you took a while, wahahahahaha!"
"......I didn\'t know where the entrance was.
 I apologize for being late."
"R‐right, umm, ...that outfit suits you, doesn\'t it?
 Wahahahahahahaha...!!"
"...Shannon...said my normal clothes wouldn\'t do, ...so we went and bought this yesterday.
 It probably doesn\'t fit me..."
"Wa‐wahahahahahahahahahahahaha, that\'s not true!
 Shannon, when I get back you\'re getting a posthumous two‐rank promotiooooon!!"
".........This place is kind of filled with girls... It\'s uncomfortable."
"Y‐y‐yeah, isn\'t it?!
 C‐come on, let\'s not hang around here, let\'s go to the stage, alright?
 \'Cause it\'ll be our turn really soon!
 Come on come on come on!!"
It seemed that Jessica was just as uncomfortable.
It looked like she was finding it difficult to cope while bathed in everyone\'s interested gaze.
...When he saw Jessica\'s appearance, Kanon thought that he might have made things difficult for her by coming.
"......I get the feeling that I\'m getting in the way.
 Am I a burden?"
"N‐no‐not at all, seriously!!"
"...If {ruby:boku:I} am in the way, please tell me at any time..."
((Kyaaa, omigooddd, he calls himself "boku"!!!!!!))
"Ahiiiiiiiii, you, you, you aren\'t a burden, Kanon‐kun!!"
(((Kyaaaaaa, she calls her boyfriend "kun"!!!!!!!)))
"......What should I do, Milady?"
(((Omigoood, she makes him call her Milady, like a butler, {ruby:omg:ktkr}!!!)))
"Nooooooooo, don\'t call me Milady todaaaaaaaaay!!"
".........Re‐...really?
 Understood, Jessica‐sama."
(((Kyaaaaa, she\'s trained him to call her "sama"!!!!!!!!)))
"S‐ss‐sorry, Kanon‐kun, just for three seconds, could you close your eyes..."
(((Hiiyaaaaaaa, kiss, it\'s a kiss, she\'s going to kiss him!!!!)))
"O‐...okay, here goes."
BANG,
 thunk!
 BAMBAM,
 SLAM,
 CRASH!!
...When Kanon opened his eyes, for some reason, there was a horrible tragedy in the room.
Everyone had been driven into the walls, their arms and legs outstretched.
Jessica put her brass knuckles in her pocket before Kanon opened his eyes.
"A‐anyway, let\'s go over to the stage.
 Our turn is coming up soon, so wait in a seat for a bit."
"\'Cause we have to get ready!
 If you go straight to the end here, there\'ll be a temporary stage, so you\'ll know where to go, just wait there!"
Kanon seemed to be having a hard time adjusting; pushing him in the back, Jessica sent him out into the corridor.
Even though Kanon was confused by Jessica\'s attitude and show of agitation, which he had never seen before, he followed her instructions and headed in the direction she had indicated.
After seeing him off with an awkward smile, Jessica slammed the door shut and yelled loudly.
"There you go, you saw, right?
 You saw, happy now?!
 Wahahahahahahahaha, sucks for you!!!"
"......ugggggggh, I lost the bet."
"I was so sure that Jessie didn\'t have a boyfriend."
"That wasn\'t a boyfriend, right, she\'s just harassing one of her servants, right?"
"Waaaah, Jessie\'s boyfriend\'s incredibleeee...!"
"Sh‐sh‐shut up!!
 Let\'s get ready, move it move it!!"
Jessica took the brass knuckles out of her pocket again, and everyone energetically returned to their tasks.
"...............haah."
Kanon went down the corridor as Jessica had told him to, and found a temporary stage set up where the vending machines should have been.
It was probably being shared in timeslots between the individual groups and clubs.
A student group was singing, and the place was already fired up.
Disliking that ruckus, he found a dark wall to lean against, alone.
......So this is what they call high school.
It sure is noisy,
 ...Kanon thought.
Then he remembered Jessica just now, acting in a way that he\'d never seen before.
......Honestly, she was in such high spirits that alcohol might have been involved.
To him, the greatest virtue for a person was to always be composed and intellectual.
In that sense, it was very hard for him to get used to the atmosphere in a school cultural festival.
...He had the responsibility of reporting everything he saw or heard to the Master.
...So he would also have to report about Jessica\'s unrestrained behavior earlier.
......At the very least, it was not fitting for a daughter of the Ushiromiya main family.
The Master, Krauss‐sama,
 ...and especially Natsuhi‐sama would probably be angry.
If I were to report it in a way that protects Milady, should I blame it on inappropriate school friends...?
".........What was all that?
 ......So stupid."
Kanon thought back on how Jessica had acted earlier, and sighed again.
He could understand Natsuhi\'s headache a little now.
......Come to think of it, Natsuhi‐sama, as the president of the PTA, should have gone straight to a social after attending the ceremony in the gymnasium.
Hadn\'t she said that she wouldn\'t be there to see Milady\'s event?
......That was probably for the best.
"............The crowds are unpleasant.
 ...What in the world do they want?"
Several female students kept glancing at me.
It seemed they were all whispering the same sort of things that Milady\'s school friends had said, and it was really unpleasant.
Come to think of it, didn\'t Shannon warn me?
......That if I was going to walk around a school festival on my own,
 I had better watch out because a lot of strange people would come and talk to me.
"He‐hello~, are you by yourself?"
Just as expected, a group of girls I\'d never met started talking to me.
Their stares started to make my back tingle.
......Didn\'t she tell me some magic words that could chase them off in times like this?
 ...Ummm.
"......Sorry.
 I\'m with someone."
"Uh, oh, really...?!
 I, I\'m sorry!"
Ah, it worked.
 Instant reaction...
Well, that got them to go away, but it hasn\'t really changed the number of people staring at me.
"No, it\'s that kid, Jessie\'s boyfriend!!"
"No way?!
 That kid?!"
"I can\'t believe it, I was sure he was fake!"
"He\'s so cuuute, is he younger than her?!
 I\'m so jealous!!"
"...............haah."
...No way I\'m ever coming to a place like this again.
 Kanon sighed for about the hundredth time that day.
As he did, the lighting changed, and the standing audience started cheering.
Looking around, I realized that there were suddenly a large number of people here.
And unlike earlier, they were all guys.
With this huge crowd, I couldn\'t even see the stage.
 Fortunately, there was a fallen beer case nearby, so I tried using that as a footstool.
And I noticed that there was now a new group on the stage.
The leader was Milady.
 She had changed into stage clothes, and was even holding a guitar.
 ......I didn\'t know she could play.
No, maybe she could.
I have seen her practicing air guitar before.
Natsuhi‐sama wouldn\'t approve of any hobbies outside of study.
Maybe she was always practicing in secret.
...Come to think of it, she\'s been returning really late from school recently, hasn\'t she?
...Maybe she\'s been practicing at school, far away from Natsuhi‐sama\'s prying eyes.
It really is for the best that Natsuhi‐sama didn\'t come.
 ...If Milady were to get scolded by Natsuhi‐sama after putting so many hours of practice in, she would probably be very dejected...
"""Jessie‐samaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!"""
"Everyone, thanks for gathering here todaaaayyyyyyyy!!"
I could hear Jessica‐sama\'s forceful voice through the speakers.
...Jessie‐sama?
 Maybe that\'s her nickname at school.
The students in the audience kept calling out that name.
...I was a little aggravated by that inferior name, which was inappropriate for Milady.
Jessica‐sama was in great spirits as they kept calling her Jessie‐sama.
...They were all probably her fans.
With her mike performance, she was responding to that and firing the place up.
...It was almost like a song program on TV.
............At first, I had thought all this was frivolous, but that feeling now changed into appreciation—this was pretty incredible in its own way.
Kanon had never listened to music of his own free will, but he had often heard the kind of music that the people of the Ushiromiya family liked.
...Since that was almost all classical music, Kanon had naturally started liking classical music too.
...So to Kanon, the songs Jessica and the others were singing were...how should you say it...
.........very modern.
In any case, he thought that if Natsuhi‐sama heard it, she would probably faint.
But everyone looked like they were having a really good time.
The die‐hard fans, who had even brought pen‐lights, sang along,
 dancing crazily with the exact same movements, almost as though it had been planned ahead.
On the stage, Jessica‐sama also sang enthusiastically, dripping with sweat.
.........He couldn\'t find a single element that was appropriate for a daughter of the Ushiromiya family,
 ...but it looked like she was having a lot of fun.
"""Jessie‐samaaaaaaaa!!
 Jessiiiiie, Jessiiiiiiiiiiie!!!"""
"Thank you!! OK, next up, we\'ve got a brand new one for you! Don\'t Call Me An Ordinary Magician!!"
...I couldn\'t keep up with the atmosphere, but...
......anyway, Milady was full of life and looked like she was having a great time.
As I looked at Milady having a great time, I thought...
Isn\'t this what Ushiromiya Jessica is really like?
...Don\'t I know better than anyone just how badly life on Rokkenjima kills your own sense of self?
Then the time she spends, ...not as Milady, the successor to the Ushiromiya family,
 but as a single girl called Jessica, living life to the fullest, must be very important to her.
...I worked close to Milady, saw her in all seasons, and I thought I knew everything about her.
...But that was only a single limited side of her, Milady of Rokkenjima.
......We are furniture.
We serve on Rokkenjima, and end our lives on Rokkenjima.
...So I had come to think that Rokkenjima itself was our whole world, as though—just like in the old geocentric theories—
the ocean spilled off the end of the world into an abyss.
But as I looked at Milady like this, I realized that this was a horribly narrow outlook.
...I still couldn\'t keep up with the excitement of the crowd.
...But I felt like I had seen something that "cannot be {y:1:‘seen’}{n:1:seen}" on Rokkenjima.
.........Although I don\'t know if that was the {y:1:‘unseeable’}{n:1:unseeable} thing Shannon was talking about.
I still can\'t see the ocean as blue...
"Wasn\'t today the cultural festival at Jessica\'s school?
 ...Has the principal been doing well?"
"...Yes, he seemed to be in good health.
 Oh, that\'s right, Ms. Takamiya was also there.
 She was particularly insistent that I give you her regards."
"Hmm, busy as usual?"
"It appeared so.
 She is a very energetic person.
 Oh, yes, there was also President Enomoto."
Naturally, the topic of Jessica\'s cultural festival came up at dinner.
School events often became social gatherings for influential people.
It was the same for the Ushiromiya family, who were big names around this area.
As Natsuhi remembered the names of the important people at the social, she updated Krauss on the news concerning them.
...Jessica didn\'t really have any interest in that discussion, and rudely slurped her pumpkin soup.
"......Milady.
 I would hesitate to call those appropriate manners."
"............Yeah yeah, sorry \'bout that."
"Jessica.
 I am always telling you to do something about your speech."
"......Yes."
Jessica answered, discouraged.
When he saw that, Krauss smiled a little and interrupted his conversation with Natsuhi.
"How was the festival for you, Jessica?"
"Huh?
 Ah,
 ......well, okay!"
"I was watching.
 You did a good job."
"Huh, ......huh?!
 Ah, ......ahahahaha, y‐yeah, I guess!"
Jessica\'s face turned bright red.
...She probably hadn\'t thought that Natsuhi would actually come to see her on the stage.
She felt a mix of happiness and embarrassment.
Actually, she hadn\'t wanted her mother to watch because she didn\'t want to be told that her music was inappropriate for the Ushiromiya family.
......But it wasn\'t as though it didn\'t make her happy to hear her parent say that she did a good job after watching her try her best...
"You appeared with both composure and dignity.
 Fitting behavior for the students\' representative."
"...ah,
 ............oh,
 ...yeah."
The smile that had been there a second ago crumbled like sand.
...Jessica immediately realized that she was talking about something different.
Jessica was also the school\'s student president.
...She had no interest in something so annoying, but her parents had been pushy so she had grudgingly accepted.
Unfortunately, she was popular in school, so she had won the election easily.
So Natsuhi was praising her for the ceremony organized by the student council at the beginning of the cultural festival.
Actually, she had just carried that out halfheartedly.
She had immediately met up with her friends, and had held a stage rehearsal for the rest of the time...
"The experience of standing above people and bearing responsibility will definitely be useful in the future.
 It will surely help you mature as a member of the Ushiromiya family."
"But you spoke the greeting a little quickly.
 You passed on content, but your fast style of speech dilutes it.
 It would be good if you developed a habit of taking a breath every once in a while."
"............yeah."
After she finished eating, Jessica didn\'t feel like going straight to her room.
You could say that her room was the place where her parents had specified for her to be.
So maybe you could say that, for Jessica,
 choosing not to return to her own room and instead disappearing to an unknown location in this large mansion was a meager form of resistance...
Jessica felt that even being in the mansion made it hard to breathe, so she went outside to the rose garden.
"...............
 ...Well, even if she had come, she\'d just have said something about how it wasn\'t appropriate for the successor to the Ushiromiya family anyway.
 ...So what the hell\'s my problem.
 Ahahahahahaha."
Jessica laughed at what she was sulking over.
...Laughed at what kind of words she would have had to receive to be satisfied.
......Ridiculous.
 In the end, I\'m just a spoiled little kid.
I can\'t believe myself—it\'s almost funny.
"......Milady."
"wah!—Kanon‐kun...
 D‐don\'t scare me like that, hahaha...!
 *cough*cough*!"
Kanon had suddenly started talking to her just as she had tried to force a laugh, so she choked.
"What?
 Something to say...?"
".....................
umm."
"......Yeah?"
Jessica\'s expression had become the one Kanon always saw.
The listless Jessica from a second ago was gone.
If he still only knew Jessica as the successor to the Ushiromiya family, as he did until today,
 ...he would have mistakenly thought that Jessica\'s mood had sprung back to normal.
......But that was wrong.
He now knew a part of her that he could not {y:1:‘see’}{n:1:see} until today, so he understood that there was no way that, on the inside, Jessica was just as she appeared.
"Ah... About today\'s cultural festival...
 ...Well, thanks for coming with me so I could show off.
 You really helped."
"......Your singing.
 ...It was good."
"Wha?!
 ......Ah,
 .........ahahahahahaha?!
 Re‐really? I\'m embarrassed..."
Even though she had heard the words she had most wanted to hear,
 ...Jessica became shy, and couldn\'t accept them frankly.
"......I cannot sing.
 And I don\'t know how to play any instruments other than the harmonica and the recorder, which I learned in elementary school.
 ...So I had just assumed that you were the same, Milady."
...Kanon hadn\'t been consciously looking down on Jessica to that degree.
But people playing unique instruments were always on the other side of the Braun tubes in the TV.
...He had got it into his head that it would be impossible for Jessica, at least.
"...I am furniture.
 ...So I didn\'t believe there was any need to sing or play instruments."
But...
...I\'m not sure anymore.
"......Kanon‐kun,
 seriously, enough with that phrase "I am furniture"...
 That\'s some kind of servant\'s mentality, right...?
 That "servants should be living furniture" thing.
 ...Genji‐san says it a lot."
"It isn\'t a mentality......
 ...We really are...furniture."
"I know the kids from the Gospel House...receive assistance from Grandfather in various ways...
and I realize you feel gratitude for that."
"......But that doesn\'t mean...you should call yourself furniture.
 Aren\'t you a human like us?"
"........................"
"Kanon‐kun, when you saw me singing, ...what did you think?"
"......It looked like you were having a lot of fun."
"That\'s probably not it."
"......Huh?"
"It wasn\'t that I looked like I was having fun,
 ...you were jealous, weren\'t you?"
"...............
 I......"
Even Kanon himself probably hadn\'t noticed that emotion.
......Kanon had seen something he had never seen before, never known of before...and had probably become jealous.
And to trick himself about that emotion, he had called himself furniture over and over...
"I know I\'m the successor to the Ushiromiya family or something,
 ......and, well, I\'m sure there\'ll be a lot of annoying stuff to do in the future too.
 As far as that goes, I\'ve just gotta resign myself to it—I was born under an unlucky star."
"...Probably, just like you had to live at the Gospel House, neither of us have a choice.
 We couldn\'t choose the stars we were born under."
"...............That may be true."
"But there\'s one part where you and me are completely different.
 ...Know what that is?"
I am furniture, and you are not.
......He was about to say that, but stopped.
"...I don\'t know."
"Kanon‐kun, you think that your own fate is everything about you, and you gave up.
 I can\'t accept this kind of fate, so I decided to do the best I can."
"......So as well as my normal constrained self who has to act as the daughter of the Ushiromiya family,
 I\'ve created another self who pours all her heart into the things she likes."
".........Another...self."
"Yeah.
 ......Kanon‐kun, you\'ve been telling yourself "I am furniture".
 ......I\'m sure there\'s been many tough things that have forced you to tell yourself that."
"...I think that\'s...
...really unfortunate.
 .........But for that to determine your entire life, that feels so sad to me."
"................................."
"You know, people can always make another self inside themselves that they can really grow to like.
 This isn\'t escaping from reality, okay?
 ......When I\'m that other part of myself, I can really feel like I\'m living a great life."
"So no matter how constrained and boring everyday life is, I can definitely live without suffocating."
"......To make...
...another self that you can really grow to like...
inside yourself..."
To make another me, which isn\'t furniture...
Through her relationship with George‐sama, has Shannon given birth to a part of herself that isn\'t furniture?
......And did this other Shannon...see something that cannot be {y:1:‘seen’}{n:1:seen} by furniture?
"Yeah.
 .........Well, I don\'t know anything about your private life, Kanon‐kun.
 But, ...I can sorta guess.
 Your private life is...probably...nothing at all.
 Bulls‐eye...?"
Kanon couldn\'t reply, but that was answer enough.
He had no concept of a private life.
So Kanon would always be Kanon.
So furniture would always be furniture.
"......Kanon‐kun, that "Kanon" isn\'t your real name, right?"
The Gospel House gave new students new families and a new life, so it also made a point of giving each of them a new name.
......In his case, that was "Kanon".
".........Certainly, ......that name of mine may be a temporary thing."
He had thought that he wasn\'t anyone other than Kanon.
......But he remembered.
...There definitely had been a part of himself that wasn\'t Kanon.
But that was far, far away, beyond the distant fog of oblivion...
"So even for you, it should be alright to have times when you\'re Kanon‐kun, and times when you aren\'t.
 ......Maybe the Kanon‐kun you are when you act as a servant calls himself furniture and strictly limits his own will."
"......But when you aren\'t Kanon‐kun, I think it\'s alright to live much, much more freely."
Those words definitely weren\'t just lip‐service.
Jessica had also been like this in the past.
She had cursed her own birth into an environment different from all of her friends at school.
She had been the only one in a heavily constricted environment, forced to learn various things,
 and she had even received words about the friends she played with.
......Though she had been sad about that, she had given up, thinking that she had just been born under that kind of star.
But one day, Jessica had stopped giving up and surrendering.
Stuff like the Ushiromiya family customs and pressure, those didn\'t matter.
She created a real "Jessica" inside herself, who could do what she really wanted to do.
"You know, I\'m called by this nickname Jessie in school.
 So when I\'m Jessie, I live life honestly and to the fullest.
 And because of that, I can do my best when I\'m Jessica too."
"...Maybe you too could have times when you\'re Kanon,
 and times when you\'re, umm,
 ......your real name, and live a different way in each.
 ......When you aren\'t Kanon, ...can\'t you try being another self who you can grow to like?"
"..................When...I am not Kanon."
He had thought that his real name didn\'t matter at all.
So he had thought Kanon was all he was.
And now Jessica was saying that he should create a new existence, another self that wasn\'t Kanon.
"......Kanon‐kun,
 if you don\'t mind, tell me.
 ......What\'s your...real name?"
"................................."
He was silent for quite some time.
Maybe his real name had risen to the tip of his tongue.
...After hesitating for a long time over whether he should say it,
 ...in the end,
 ...he swallowed it back down.
"......I forgot.
 ...My name doesn\'t matter anymore."
Those words signified a slight rejection.
"No matter what kind of real name I had,
 ......the only truth now is that here, I am Kanon.
 The past has nothing to do with anything.
 ......Just as it does not matter the name of the tree from whose trunk a piece of furniture was originally made."
"......I said stop that!
 You aren\'t furniture, you\'re human, you know?!"
"I am not human!"
Kanon clearly spoke his refusal.
......It was with a rage that he normally didn\'t show.
Jessica couldn\'t say anything back, and was struck silent...
"...You are human, Milady.
 So you are free to live any way you like,
 and any kind of future is possible for you.
 It\'s almost like you have wings and can dance through the sky like a bird."
"But I am not like that.
 Even if you see me as a bird, I am nothing more than a domestic duck.
 ......They may have wings, but they cannot fly."
"To speak of that dream of flight despite that,
 ......that\'s just...
too cruel...!"
"...Furniture, ducks!!
 What the hell is all this!!
 ............No, ..."
Jessica had unconsciously gone along with Kanon\'s forceful manner of speaking, but she realized that she shouldn\'t fire back, and swallowed her words.
"...............I don\'t know anything about you.
 I don\'t even know your upbringing, and I don\'t know the hardships you\'ve been through.
 ...So I can\'t even imagine why you started calling yourself furniture."
"......But know this.
 You aren\'t furniture or a duck.
 You\'re a real human."
"................................."
"If you want to say that the Kanon‐kun working as a servant is furniture, that\'s alright.
 ......But, ...in that case,
 ......don\'t you think you can make another self for when you aren\'t furniture, when you\'re human?"
"......Only a human like you can embrace that possibility.
 ...I am not like that.
 I have no future, no possibilities, and no dreams I am permitted to see."
"............So, Milady.
 Please don\'t...
say any more...
....cruel things......"
"Why...
 Why......are you saying that..."
"Because it seems that you are mistaking me for...a human just like you, Milady.
 We are different beings.
 I just wanted to make that clear."
"......I heard from Shannon.
 Something about you taking a liking to me."
"Huh, ......huh?!
 Ah, .........no, wahaha..."
"...I look almost identical to a human.
 Therefore, .........like Shannon, maybe I could delude myself that I am human, and for a time, pretend to love."
"...But that would surely be fooling myself.
 No, it would also be fooling you, Milady.
 Shannon and George‐sama will definitely fall apart.
 ...Shannon herself must understand that day will come, and yet she does this...stupid..."
"There, ......there\'s nothing stupid about it!!
 Sure, George nii‐san\'s a brilliant person, and he\'s bearing both of his parents\' expectations."
"...And yeah, when it comes to marriage, I\'m sure Auntie Eva\'s gonna interfere in a bunch of ways, and, umm, I think they\'ve got a really tough road ahead of them, alright?!
 ...But you know, George nii‐san isn\'t the kind of guy who\'ll surrender to all that!
 He won\'t turn Shannon into Juliet, he\'ll definitely make her happy!!"
"People and furniture cannot love one another.
 ...I am trying to say that even if you can love furniture, I cannot love you, Milady."
"..................nn—"
Those words of Kanon\'s......crushed all of Jessica\'s bittersweet feelings from today.
There was no way she could have anticipated the emotions of such a blunt rejection...
In an instant, she lost the willpower that had caused her to try and unravel something stubborn in Kanon\'s heart,
 ...and before she knew it, she was just standing there in shock...
"......Milady, if your feelings for me are due to my conceit, then I beg for your forgiveness."
"...N‐......no.
 ...Well, uh, ...I won\'t deny it."
"......Thank you very much."
"Huh...?"
"For thinking of me as a human,
 ...thank you very much.
 Just those feelings truly make me happy.
 ......And anything more would be too cruel, so..."
"No, tha‐...that\'s enough.
 ...Umm,
 .........sorry."
Jessica scratched at her head as she spoke, and tried to force her voice to sound bright.
"......I just kinda...
...ran on ahead by myself,
 ...and caused you trouble.
 ...I\'m honestly sorry.
 I\'m really sorry...for using up your whole day off."
"No.
 ......I was also...happy that I could see you having fun."
"...Then, let\'s be done for the night.
 ......If I don\'t go back to my room and turn off the lights, Mom will get mad at me again.
 ...Hahaha."
"That would probably be most appropriate.
 ...I wish you a good night, Milady."
"......Yeah.
 ............Good night........."
Jessica turned her back to him, and slowly trodded away, looking disheartened.
But suddenly, she started dashing pell‐mell, and disappeared in the direction of the mansion...
As he watched her go, ...for just an instant,
 Kanon was tormented by the feeling that he had just made a huge mistake.
...But, no, he thought, this had not been a mistake at all.
......It was for her sake that he\'d been forced to refuse her now, while her pain was still at its smallest.
"............Nice going, making a woman cry like that.
 *cackle*cackle*.
 I didn\'t expect you to refuse her that strongly.
 ......Had you answered normally, another pair of lovers would have been born with my magic."
"How long have you been there...?
 .........You\'re just horrible."
When he turned around, the witch was suddenly there.
...It looked like she had been there the whole time, enjoying their performance as if it were a play.
"I shall forgive your reckless words towards me just this once in deference to that pleasant show.
 ......Even after one thousand years, no more interesting show exists than complications between men and women.
 To me, it\'s an addictive pleasure sweeter than any other.
 ......nn?"
Kanon pulled that butterfly brooch out of his pocket.
It was the crystallization of the great magic that the witch had bestowed.
Without hesitation, Kanon flung it hard onto the ground and stomped on it.
"......Hoh?
 What is the meaning of this, when you know that was something given by me?"
"Just now, I figured it out.
 ......What you are doing isn\'t as tasteful as being a cupid of love.
 You are just a demon who enjoys showing love to those who can never be joined, and deceiving them."
"...............Hmph.
 ...You are free to think that.
 Most humans I have lent my power to have said the same thing."
"Don\'t play dumb!!
 You didn\'t lend Shannon your power because you felt sorry for her.
 ...You took advantage of a weak point in Shannon\'s heart as it burned with love, and made her break the mirror that sealed you.
 And that\'s not all,
 ...you\'re toying with her, when you know very well how it\'s all going to end!
 Am I wrong?!"
"Hehheheheheh, *cackle*!
 Furniture is a thoroughly pitiful existence.
 So you have no dreams, no future, and even no love?
 Good, good, there is nothing better than knowing your place.
 *cackle*cackle*!"
".........khh..."
"Just as you suspected, there was a faint love growing in Jessica\'s heart.
 You are under the impression that you have snipped it out, harvested it."
"......But did you know?
 Trees grow thicker branches if you thin them out, instead of letting them grow rampant. ......A girl who loves furniture, interesting, truly interesting!
 Shannon and George will also eventually reach a stalemate with their unfulfillable love, and will bear just the kind of large fruit I like."
"However, to my regret, they\'ve been getting on so well that it just isn\'t interesting, you see?
 In that respect, I think you two shall entertain me greatly, *cackle*cackle*!"
The witch laughed.
 Even though she had known that the two could not be joined, she had lent magic to join them together.
However, they couldn\'t escape the fate that made it impossible for them to be joined.
......The witch knew that.
Even if they were joined, the relationships of Shannon and George, Kanon and Jessica would fail for certain,
 and as they wandered through the eternal desert in the hell of love, they would be tormented by eternal thirst...!
"Did you think I would lend them that power without any compensation?
 I\'ll lend a hand in love.
 And my compensation shall be one ticket to watch the cruel fate that the two of them will eventually meet.
 Even after one thousand years, no better show exists...!"
"Just look at Kinzo.
 See how he ended up, an old, pitiful man who knew the taste of love and was thrown out of Paradise!
 Look at how he lives, like a dead man who can\'t fully die.
 *cackle*cackle*!!"
"You really are a witch.
 Get out of my sight, you demon...!!"
"......I shall disappear regardless.
 My power still hasn\'t returned, you see.
 It is still tiring to continue showing myself."
"......I overdid it when I gave you lovers my power.
 ...As I am now, it will not be easy to maintain that power without that brooch as a catalyst."
Kanon ground his foot even more into the stomped brooch.
He felt it break under his foot.
Then, it dissolved as if into water,
 and changed into butterflies that sparkled gold, which fluttered away from beneath Kanon\'s foot...
"I also find it a little difficult to continue preserving this form.
 As you ask, I will hide myself for a brief period.
 Just as there is no tide that does not rise, and no moon that does not wax, my magical power will surely become whole again.
 ...And there will surely come a time that is appropriate for my revival."
"......I cannot imagine whether that will be tomorrow, next year, or even one hundred or one thousand years in the future.
 But as long as there are those that entertain me, I will surely gain power and revive.
 ......I will disappear for a short while, until that time comes."
"The bruise on the palm of your hand is already gone,
 so if you wish, tomorrow morning, you can let my existence disappear like an illusion or a dream.
 ......There is nothing more saddening for me than to be forgotten."
"However, I will definitely be revived.
 Make sure that you won\'t regret that day\'s coming at any time.
 I will surely have my second coming and control everything as this island\'s true master.
 ...And at that time, the door to the Golden Land will be opened again.
 ...The covetous and the greedy shall call me forth without fail...!"
"...Enough!!
 Disappear, now, Golden Witch...!!"
Leaving behind a mocking laugh, the witch turned into a flight of gold butterflies, and scattered away.
...The whole area sparkled like a gold blizzard in a snow globe.
It was a fleeting fantastical scene that disappeared in a heartbeat...
The witch could no longer be seen.
 ...However, Kanon felt like he could still hear that shrill, unpleasant laugh...
......Aahh, how entertaining, how entertaining.
Why is the human world so entertaining after such a long absence?!
Go insane with love. Go insane with gold.
Those that don\'t go insane from those are not human!
I see, then the word furniture is fitting indeed, *cackle*cackle*!
Furniture is created to serve humans.
And I toy with and tyrannize those humans to ease my thousand years of boredom.
What a truly entertaining rock‐paper‐scissors situation, that I cannot control furniture!
Kinzo, your enterprises are truly interesting!
Furniture, try and see if you can hunt me...!
Tonight, two seeds of love have been sown.
...Including the one already sown, that makes three!
"BEATRICE...
 Why...did you leave me alone in this painful world...?
 ......I detest you.
 You are yearned after this much, and yet make no attempt to answer... I will detest you for all eternity!"
"My lord, drinking any more will be damaging to your health.
 ...Haven\'t you also been warned by Doctor Nanjo?"
"Be silent, Genji!!
 You do not understand, you do not understand my grief and sadness!
 Even though I believed that as my oldest friend, at least you would understand my pain!!
 Why is it so incomprehensible to you?!"
"Oooooohhh, BEATRICEEEE,
 why did you leave me alooooone......?!!"
"..........................."
"Uuuuughhu!
 Hic, hic...!
 What the hell is all that furniture stuff?!
 What is all that crap...!
 Uuuuuuuuuughhu!!"
"......Ohhh, how heartrending, Jessica‐sama.
 ...Even though her crying voice that I can hear from her room tells me of the situation, there is nothing I can do."
"...This is all a tragedy due to people who are too young getting too close, when the positions of their birth are too distant.
 ...I can do nothing but understand Milady\'s feelings, and walk away quietly with silent feet..."
"...Umm,
 ...wh‐
what...
......do you mean by that,
 George‐san...?"
"I mean what I said.
 ......I still haven\'t built up my castle.
 Once I have, I will be able to think of myself as an adult for the first time.
 ......When that happens, I want to marry you."
"......Tha‐
...that\'s, umm,
 ......err..."
"But,
 my heart won\'t let me do just that anymore.
 ......So I want to give you an engagement ring."
"En‐...engagement...
...you say...
 But, umm,
 ......I\'m...
 ......f‐
............furniture........."
"That\'s right.
 And furniture has to listen to what people say."
"...I am currently having a ring made that\'s worthy to be a gift for you.
 I think I\'ll probably be able to bring it to the family conference coming up soon.
 I\'ll give it to you then, so please, I want you to let me hear your answer."
"......If you accept my engagement proposal,
 I will proclaim right there, to all of the relatives, including Grandfather, my engagement to you."
"Geor‐......George‐san............"
"I\'m sure some people won\'t approve of our relationship.
 ...But there\'s no need to look at their faces.
 ...Because you only have to fill your eyes with me."
"I will definitely make you happy.
 That, I promise you, definitely."
I look forward to seeing how it will ripen!
The gold butterflies do not swoop upon the juice of overripe and rotting fruit.
I cannot wait for the day of harvest to come! Is the time of the banquet here yet?!*cackle*cackle*hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha...!!
