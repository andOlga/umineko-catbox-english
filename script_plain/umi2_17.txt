Battler could be found in the dining hall.
Unable to summon the will to return to the guesthouse in the middle of this rain,
 he had wandered halfheartedly around the mansion in search of a random place to sit, ...and had stationed himself in the dining hall.
He hadn\'t bothered to lock it.
He did think that maybe the shapeless murderer, or the Golden Witch, might come to kill him now that he was isolated,
 but he no longer thought about resisting that.
On the contrary, he had no intention of blocking the culprit with a lock.
He wanted that person to come at him openly, from the front.
...If it was a murderer, he thought he\'d ask them to tell about some of those wonderful locked room tricks as a parting souvenir.
And if it was a witch, he thought he\'d ask her to at least take his life with some wonderful magic.
......However, ironically, neither of these two came to meet Battler...
Battler opened the liquor cabinet on his own and enjoyed the liquor to his heart\'s content.
No longer was there anybody anywhere who would have a problem with him drinking alcohol.
He boldly set both of his legs on the extravagant tablecloth and savored the high‐quality liquor, which probably had a mind‐boggling price, straight from the neck of the bottle....
At that time, ......someone knocked.
Battler realized that he was about to meet his maker...
"Heee~yy, it\'s not locked.
 Come in, whoever you are.
 And please introduce yourself.
 If you\'re human, gimme your name.
 And if you\'re {f:5:Beatrice}, gimme your three sizes."
"You might not believe this, but I\'m a pretty well‐known breast‐sommelier, y\'sheee?"
".........It is Genji, Battler‐sama."
"...Genji‐san, huh.
 ......Sorry, but I\'m not interested in your bust size.
 Please, come in. It\'s open."
".........Excuse me."
Genji‐san opened the door and bowed.
.........So Genji‐san was the culprit after all, ...or maybe an accomplice?
 ......That theory would probably explain most of the tricks...
"Did you come to give me my last rites?"
".........Nothing of the sort.
 ......I shall excuse myself if I am disturbing you."
"...Wait, wait, excusing yourself without even telling me what you wanted would actually just be creepy.
 ...What do you want?
 ...Please, let me do as I wish, at least in the very end."
".........Battler‐sama, is it truly your wish...
to spend the little time you have left in such an indolent fashion?"
Those words...stung...
......Of course it wasn\'t.
"...............................
 What can I do at this point?
 ......I\'m ready to die at any time..."
"......You are just like the Master.
 Indeed, you inherited the Master\'s blood strongly...."
"You mean to tell me that Grandfather, that larger‐than‐life man, was actually willing to die at any moment...?
 First I\'ve heard of that."
".........The Master\'s life,
 ......after a number of sad incidents,
 ......was completely reduced to atonement."
"...What do you know?"
"............{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama\'s ritual has been entirely completed up to the eighth twilight.
 ...I believe...that I can now tell you everything."
"Wha‐......what did you say...?"
My drunkenness was completely blown away.
 I lowered my feet from the table and listened carefully to hear what kind of words Genji‐san would say next...
"Battler‐sama.
 ......I shall guide you to the Master\'s study.
 ......It would probably be better to hear it directly from them."
"From......them...?
 H‐hey, what in the world do you mean by that...!!"
"......Come, this way.
 I shall guide you.
 Battler‐sama."
After Genji‐san told me to follow him, he started to walk down the corridor.
I sobered up completely and went after him...
We climbed the big staircase, .........towards the third floor.
Genji‐san stopped walking halfway.
He then turned back and spoke.
".........Battler‐sama.
 ......From here on, you will...
......probably see things you will not be able to understand."
"Don\'t try to intimidate me.
 .........I\'ve already seen plenty of things I can\'t understand today."
".........Please accept what you see as you see it,
 and what you hear as you hear it."
"Questions like "Why?",
 or "What?",
 ...there is no need for such things.
 ...Battler‐sama, you will probably simply learn the truth.
 Whether to accept it, believe it,
 or even deny it, are all choices I leave to you."
"....................................."
Genji‐san checked one last time to see whether I was prepared to learn the truth.
The eighth twilight had already ended.
 And on the ninth twilight, the witch revives, ......and none shall be left alive.
It meant that {f:5:Beatrice} had already revived.
...And probably, none of us would be allowed to return alive.
If I was going lose my life anyway, ......I wanted to know the truth in the end.
...It didn\'t matter how hard it might be to accept.
"..................Yeah.
 ......Even if a demon or a witch shows up, ...I\'m prepared."
".........You really are just like the Master in his youth.
 ......Battler‐sama, please be diligent in your studies.
 In the future, you will surely have great aspirations.
 And make sure that at that time, you are not forced into a lifetime of regret by a lack of academic knowledge."
".........If I have a chance to work hard in my studies, then no problem."
".............................."
Genji‐san\'s silence forced me to consider that resignation of mine more deeply...
And, .........we could see the door of Grandfather\'s study, impregnated with a sweet smell.
From his pocket, Genji‐san withdrew a gold key with an elegant design.
The master keys had been confiscated by Auntie Rosa, but the key to this study alone, he had kept with him.
He put it in the keyhole, .........and it made a heavy clunking sound.
".........My lord.
 It is Genji.
 I have brought Battler‐sama with me."
There was no reply, but it seemed that permission to go in had been given...
"Come, Battler‐sama.
 ......Please enter."
"..................Yeah.
 ......In I go."
I readied myself, ......and threw the door open...
At that moment, ...I got slightly disoriented by the dazzling golden glow..........
It was, .........somehow,
 ......a swarm of butterflies, shining gold.
The golden butterflies that were completely filling the inside of the study poured out all at once.......
"Wha‐............
 ......What the heck...
......is thiiiss.................."
It was almost like golden leaf confetti.
The interior of Grandfather\'s study was filled with a golden glow...
And......there were reception sofas and a table for guests placed in front of the study desk,
 .........and I could see Grandfather\'s back.
There was someone on the side opposite from Grandfather.
...It was in shadow, so I couldn\'t see it well...
"......My lord.
 I have brought Battler‐sama."
"............Battler, is it?
 I\'m busy thinking now...
 Be silent for a while......"
Kinzo declared that in displeasure, his back still turned.
It seemed that he was enjoying playing chess with a visitor...
Apparently, the opponent had counterattacked with a superb move.
Kinzo seemed to be enjoying himself as he thought deeply, while occasionally laughing and groaning...
"I thought for thirty years.
 ......I thought for thirty years about how to counterattack this move...
 Have fun, have fun with the move I fermented for thirty years."
"......Heheheheheheheh.
 Indeed, this is a deeply matured move.
 ......Such fun, such fun... *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*, hahahahahahaha...!!
 Unbeatable, unbeatable."
"......Wha‐
............what is...
......this........."
"So you came, Battler.
 Wait just a moment.
 Be silent for Kinzo\'s sake.
 ...Isn\'t it too early to resign, Kinzo?
 I can already counterattack for several moves.
 *cackle*cackle*cackle*...!"
It should have been...
...my first meeting with that witch.
However, ...I knew this witch.
Even though it was our first meeting,
 ...I knew her,
 ......from the portrait......!
"Genji.
 Serve something for Battler.
 What would be the most appropriate for this man...?"
"......The same which the Master has loved since the days of his youth."
"That is ideal; serve it to him.
 ......You did well coming here, Ushiromiya Battler.
 First, take a seat."
".........You called my name many times, did you not?
 In deference to that, I allowed you to meet me.
 ...So, what will you ask me?
 What will you inquire?"
"......The door to the Golden Land will soon be opened.
 Soon, we will have a banquet to celebrate my revival, to which I will be welcoming the witches.
 ...In the meantime, I\'ll be answering your questions, as many as you like."
"I, ......I have a bunch of things I want to ask about!!
 What happened on this island?!
 And why did these incidents happen?!"
"I want to ask about the locked rooms too!!
 What about the chapel?!
 What about Jessica\'s room?!
 And the servant room?!
 And Aunt Natsuhi\'s room?!
 And the parlor?!"
"There\'s more still I want to ask about!!
 About the witch\'s true nature!!
 Are you really a witch?!!
 What is your purpose, what do you want to make us do and why did you call me here?!!
 Answer me, about everything!!!"
"Arrrrghhh, be quiet!!
 You think merely asking will get you answers?!?!"
"Don\'t say that, Kinzo.
 A fragile and fleeting spider web did protect from King Herod once.
 ......Just as there are no useless things in this world, there are also no useless questions."
"Very well, I\'ll answer all your questions.
 ......But, I do have one condition."
"What is it?"
"Once you have heard everything, if you are satisfied of my existence,
 ............kneel, and kiss my shoes.
 I called you here because I wanted to make you submit to me."
"...Kinzo and I made a bet.
 We bet on which would come first, Kinzo thinking of a new move, or me forcing you to submit.
 I don\'t see myself losing.
 *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*...!"
"...D‐............Damn you, talking so tough!!
 Yeah, alright.
 Try to make me admit it.
 ...Try to make me admit that you\'re a witch and that you can use weird, awesome, and great magic!!"
"If I submit, I\'ll kiss your shoes or do whatever else you want!!!"
The witch cackled gloatingly.
Then, she glared at him unpleasantly with eyes that said a man can\'t go back on his word...
"Well said!!
 So, from what question shall I begin?!
 I\'ll answer everything!!
 Come, what will the first one be?!?!"
