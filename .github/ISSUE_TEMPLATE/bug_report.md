# IMPORTANT!

I will NOT fix any issues that are found in the base game itself. If the issue you are trying to report can be reproduced in v1.3.0 of the base game, while playing in Japanese, and it's not translation-related, it will be ignored.

Furthermore, if you are reporting an issue related to the PS4/PS5 version of the game, I cannot promise I will be able to fix it. I'll try my best to get it to work for you regardless, but since I don't have a hacked PS4 and have no idea how to mod that version of the game, I may be unable to do so.

If you understand and accept the above, please *delete everything* from this input box except the form below. Then, fill the form out, picking *one* of the presented options from the square brackets in each category and removing the rest.

Platform: [Atmosphère/Ryujinx/Yuzu/PS4/PS5]
Issue type: [missing translation/broken text/incorrect (or missing) nametag/untranslated image/something else (describe in detail)]
Episode number: [1-8 or Tsubasa/Hane/Saku]
Chapter name: [specify, e.g. "Arrival at Niijima Airport" (you can find this by pressing X/Square twice)]
Screenshot of issue: [attach one if relevant]
Text around the issue: [specify some lines of *correctly translated* text that is close to the issue you are describing so that I can search the script for them]
